    Welcome to the Masters of Technology newsletter.  We aren't another lame
group, just a publisher of information such as Phrack.  Anyone can write for
MOT, just send me the article at "Gfather@cris.com", or at the L0pht BBS.
    Hopefully we will have more articles for the next newsletter, but this
issue does have some neat info.

Affilz:     You think this is a warez newsletter?  Jeez...  BTW, I want to
            be in the PLA so I can be a cool d00d, and order Scott the 
            Believer a calling card, because he is so kindhearted.  God bless
            Scotty and Amanda. :)

                                Blocking ANI
                                Phile 2 of 5
                            By: The Godfather

    If you have not heard of ANI, let me briefly explain.  ANI is what the
phone company uses to automatically identify your number for billing.   It
is LIKE caller ID, but caller ID is sent between the first and second ring.
ANI is instant.  If you use an AT&T calling card/credit card, the number
used to call from is on the bill.  If you use AT&T k0dEZ from your home,
that is how they bust you.  No fancy-smancy traces like in Sneakers, they
already have the number.  ANI is ONLY (currently) available to the phone
company, or SACs (Special Area Codes, 800, 900, and such).
    Anyway, this can pose a serious problem to your freedom.  If you can 
find a divertor, by all means use it.  This technique does not work every-
where.  It does work in my area, GTE with a DCO electronic switch.  
A method similiar to this was described in SCAM! magazine, but their method
does not work anymore.
    To block ANI, dial 0 for the operator.  Have her connect you to 800-
xxx-xxxx.  If she bitches, either say a key (besides 0) on your phone is
broken, or get a handicapped flag on your line.  She will send an ANI of
NPA-000-0000.  (Always test this on an ANI number like 1-800-MY-ANI-IS 
first, it is better to be overly careful, than to be in a cell with Bruno,
the cellmate that axed his family to death).  Notice that on MOST switches,
multiple ANI failures are flagged.  Don't use this unless you HAVE to use
your k0dEZ from home.  Always better to use a divertor.
    The end result is the 800 number you had her dial will get an ANI 
readout of NPA-000-0000.  If it is AT&T, they will ask you for your phone
number.  Give them one of a person you hate, but IT HAS TO BE IN THE SAME
AREA CODE (npa).  Feel free to use your hard earned k0dEZ.

                             The Truth on 950s
                                Phile 3 of 5
                             By: The Godfather

    Well, someone already stressed this to me, but I had to find out for 
myself.  IF USED CAREFULLY, 950s ARE (MOST OF THE TIME) 100% SAFE!  Still,
they CAN trace, they DO trace, so I don't recommend calling from home with-
out SOME way of blocking your ANI, whichever it be my method, or a divertor,
or such.
    As a test, I abused a friends MCI calling card (with his permission),
from a payphone, and a small call from his house.  We used 950-1022, not
the 800# (1-800-950-1022).  We made several calls to different places, and
when the bill came, instead of the originating phone number being on the 
bill as with AT&T, all it that was there was a ridiculous Dallas, TX.  He he,
and we did this down in Hillsboro, about 80 miles from Dallas.  After 
telling MCI someone must have stolen his card (heh), we talked to one
of their fraud reps.  They said "unless a specific trace is made, or the
call record is examined, that call cannot be traced because they used our
regional dialup".  Good, lets keep it that way.  Anyway, I did a run down
of other cards with different friends, and this is how it went:

AT&T Mastercard
-------------------
Number Called:  xxx-xxx-xxxx
Number Originated from:  817-xxx-xxxx   (Payphone, exact number)

MCI  Calling Card
-------------------
Number Called:  xxx-xxx-xxxx
Number Originated from:  Dallas, TX

Sprint FoneCard
-------------------
Number Called:  xxx-xxx-xxxx
Number Originated from:  Cleburne, TX   (Exact city, but not phone number)

| How the Magic is Done |
`-----------------------'
   I am warning you! if you are chicken shit and hate to speak to
   operators then you wont like this method!! 

   The first step is calling 1-800-265-5328 (800-COLLECT). You will
   probably want to divert if you are calling from home.

   Once you are connected to the 800 # it will say .. "Thank You
   for calling 1-800-COLLECT.. Please Enter the number you wish
   to call .. area code first" . You will hit "0". You will then
   be transfered to a MCI operator. She will come on and say "May I
   have the Area code and Number you are calling". This is when you 
   tell the Operator how PBXPhreak defrauds MCI everyday of his life 
   and tell the MCI fraud squad his info!! (just kidding). When she
   asks for the # you wish to call, tell her a # you want to call.
   You can tell her any number except some #'s it doesnt notice in
   its database. Like Defcon voice bridge (801-855-3326) and the rest
   of those silly 801 partylines (801-234-4444) (801-234-7448) . She
   will then ask you for your name. You will tell the operator "I would
   like to charge this call on my mastercard. (Use this dead card) 
   She will ask for the card number. (5371-5990-0600-2787) . Now she
   will ask for expiry date (01/98) . She will now ask for Zip code .. 
   Here is the trick. You must say its an overseas card. (she will enter
   00000 into the computer) .. (MCI only checks algorithm for overseas cards)
   if you told her a zipcode for the USA , the computer would check the 
   zipcode against the card and it would not be valid. The call should go
   through. She will say. "Thankyou for using 1-800-COLLECT".

   If you are using a payphone you can use the MCI Carrier Access K0DE
   and it will be AUTOMATED!!.. DIAL like so. 

     10222+0+718-123-4567 (Enter your Number you wish to kall!!)

     After you enter that you will hear a voice "MCI". Then the automated
     operator will say "For a Collect call press 11". When you hear that
     enter the Credit Card #. Then it will ask for expiry. Then is will ask
     for Mailing Zipcode. You will enter "00000" (5 if you cant count). then
     it will say "Thankyou for using MCI".

                      "Thankyou for ABUSiNG MCi" - PBXPhreak

                                  Editoral 
                              By: The Godfather

    I am going to try to put out an editoral every issue.  Unless I really
think you have a good article, you can't put one here, its MY column :)
    After seeing wars on wares, carding, and all the stuff you can get into,
I decided to point out the "ethics", and "wrongs" of a lot of issues that
everyone faces today in the scene.  I'll put my opinion below.

Hacking:
  
[ Good Stuff ]

   *  It's phun
   *  You learn something
   *  You get expierence in many OS' and computers

[ Bad Stuff ]

   *  It's illegal
   *  People crash systems
   *  Someone might get hurt

[ My Opinion ]

    I think hacking is fine... as long as you don't crash or delete any
part of the system UNLESS it is tracking you or keeping you from gaining
access.  RM /R from the root directory shows irresponsibility, you should
get busted.  DON'T shit around in medical systems, killing people is NOT
fun on your conscience (even if you don't have one).

Phreaking:

[ Good Stuff ]
  
    * You don't lose all your money paying Ma Bell
    * No one pays but the 100 billion dollar net worth Bells

[ Bad Stuff ]

    * You can get busted
    * It is stealing

[ My Opinion ]

    Do it.  Love it.  Watch your ass.  If you do it right, you don't get
busted, and actually you aren't STEALING, you are (A) Redistributing wealth,
or (B) Taking back what they (Bell) stole from your parents.

Anarchy:

[ Good Stuff ]
 
    * You learn chemistry

[ Bad Stuff ]

    * You could hurt or kill yourself
    * You could hurt or kill other people
    * You could get MAJORLY busted
    
[ My Opinion ]

    Besides the occasional smoke bomb diversion, anarchy is sick and wrong.
(Unless as revenge, but no bombs and shit, I just mean REVENGE anarchy).  
The chances of getting killed yourself are great, besides, it is actually
pretty stupid.  Think about it, and go into another line of work.  This 
doesn't mean I won't publish anarchy articles, but if they are highly 
dangerous, NO NO NO NO NO!  If they are funny, I will probably publish
them.

Carding:

[ Good Stuff ]

     * You get phree equipment

[ Bad Stuff ]
   
     * VERY easy to get busted
     * hurts the CC companies, which drives up prices for us paying 
       customers

[ My Opinion ]

    This one is pretty hard to have a straight-and-narrow opinion on.
I don't think you should card anything but services.  No ordering stuff.
There are other ways to get things without using a card.  I got a whole
computer system for fixing it twice after the owners got a new one. 

Virii:

[ Good Stuff ]

     * You exercise your programming skills
     * You can defeat mighty powerful enemies

[ Bad Stuff ]
 
     * You can get yourself or your phriends
     * You can get caught

[ My Opinion ]

    Revenge is a dish best served cold.  I don't have anything against
virii writers, actually, I have done it before myself, I am fluent in 
assembler.  But... meaningless virii are just digital junk.  Think about it,
is it worth it, or do you want fame?

Warez:

[ Good Stuff ]
  
     * You get free software!

[ Bad Stuff ]

     * You are stealing, sometimes from small companies.

[ My Opinion ]

    If it is a game that is fairly cheap, go buy it.  But for those grosly
inflated programming languages and comm programs, pirate them...  Generaly,
I pirate if it is over $50 at a discount store.  See if anyone you know has
a copy of the program they are NOT using, then, if they give it to you, you 
aren't breaking the law.


    If you disagree with me, send your flames to /dev/null.  You didn't have
to read this, it is just my opinion after all.
