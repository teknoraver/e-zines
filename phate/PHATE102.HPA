                  PHATE VOLUME 1 Issue 02. Introduction. 

                      "Ruff In the Phuture Bizniz"
 

 Hello, and welcome to PHATE magazine's sophmore edditon.. Well, its our 
 second time out and I think we've increased our magazine size by 3 times
 since our first issue. I would like to say that we could not have
 possibly created this mag without all the help of the writers who 
 contributed somthing to the magazine. There are some excellent articles
 in this issue from Axiom's Brittish Telecom Payfone article, to 
 Slycath's Police National Computer article. A thick read all the way
 through.

 Now looking at the table of contents you may feel that myself the editor,
 has alot of articles printed in this issh.. actually there really is only
 two.. the article I included as an addition to Slycath's UK Cordless
 evesdropping file, and my scanner which I originally planned to release in
 the article. All the rest of this, what you are reading now, and the news
 at the end is just a little journalism that re-inforces the backbone of the
 magazine.

 Generaly what this all calls for more articles from more people, and this
 means YOU! It is not nessisary to be a member of PHATE to write articles
 for our magazine. We will except all well writen articles concerning but
 not limited to telecomunications, hacking, networks, drugs, surveilance,
 explosives, networks, etc. Your news items will also be excepted. News
 items must be current, and must not have appeared in any other electronic
 newsletter. If you send us news about someone you know that got busted
 or something scene related

 Any articles or recent news that you have (please include
 a source if your news was published previously in either electronic or
 paper format) are welcome for publishing. We accept any articles on
 telephones and telecomunications, general hacking, networks, drugs,
 surveilance, explosives, and any and all other well writen articles on any
 form of hard to get, and little known information of such nature.

 As well, in the future we are including a letters to the editor section, so
 if you have gripes or praises, questions or suggestions, please mail them to
 me on Hanger 18, the number should be listed at the end of this magazine.
 Also, if you have contributions, please mail them to me in private on
 Hanger 18 and only on Hanger 18. I dont have to time to go checking on all
 of our boards for articles, so please, if you want your letter or article
 included in the next issue, send them ONLY to Hanger 18.

                                    -*-

 I think that it might be a little utopian to say that we are living in an
 information age (as i do a few paragraphs below). You might say that you
 who are reading this for entertainment/information value, myself, and all of
 our cohorts, piers and inspirations are part of the information CULT. We
 all share information amoungst each other and we all inform each other
 of new and interesting tidbits of data that may be relevant to each others
 interest. Many people, the United States government, big businesses, etc,
 may feel that this information is private and that it should not even be
 looked at by such mere mortal souls. The same organizations freely trade
 information about yourself: your name, number, social security, & address
 amoungst themselves. Moreover, they often sell said information at a high
 cost to solicitors for their own usage. These same companies that hoard
 so much information on both you and itself, are deadly afraid of "US". Who
 are US? The technological/security/computer criminal justice writer, the
 hacker, the telephone enthusiast. All of those individuals who will some
 day, if they have not already, assimilate themselves into the companies
 they once "hacked", by word or deed,  to make them stronger and to reinforce
 the company's technological structure. Sounds alot like selling out to big
 brother doesnt it? But its not. Its staying in love with the things you've
 always loved: phones, electronics, radio phrequencies, computer systems,
 networks etc.. and getting payed at the same time. We at PHATE, and many of
 our contacts, friends, and associates, seek never to destroy ANY 
 information whatsoever. In fact we feel such actions to be inexcusable
 and unforgivable. We catagoricaly look unfavourably upon the fraudluent
 actions of the REAL computer criminals, the CARREER CRIMINALS, who seek
 their fortunes preying upon their company by means of technology. Further-
 more, we look unfavourably upon any actions involving technology and 
 computers which may fraudulently attempt to transfer funds or otherwise
 obtain said monies for unauthorized personal use. This may sound like
 some disclaimer bullshit, but its the honest truth. Any of you inquiring
 "journalists" can question any one of the supposed members of the hacker
 and technologist/security/crime community and they would probably tell
 you much the same. This is an idea however alien it may seem is shared
 by many people, not just the aformentioned groups. It is held dear by the
 MIT AE Lab originals, the hackers of yesteryear, and the technological
 reporters and writers of our day. In conclusion, if you read this 
 magazine and you find it dangerous, throw it away; but if you read this
 magazine and you find it interesting and enjoying, send it to another
 one of your friends and wait for more to come. Be secure in the knowlege
 that as long as we can exist before there comes ANOTHER bust motivated
 by fear and lack of knowlege, we are living somewhat uneasy, somewhat
 self-assured, in the information age.

 The Hacker Crackdown "Law And Disorder on the Electronic Frontier"
    -Bruce Sterling

 Cyberpunk "Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier"
    - Katie Hafner

 Hackers
    - Steven Levey 

 (although not about the more mordern sect of "hackers", this book is an
  excellent look at the origins of personal computers and the IDIVIDIUALS
  not corporations, that created them, the dawn of the MIT AE labs, and
  other events crucial to the comming of the computer age..) 

 NOTE: Just a word of editorialsm here... Alot of fuss has been made at
       times by technological purists, old-school hackers, etc, that 
       the new breed of "hackers" have tarnished the sacred name that 
       originated with the original electronic tinkerers that brought us
       into the age of personal computers. As I see it, both types of
       hackers are more alike than they are different. Both have a quest
       for knowledge that must be fulfilled. Both will go to most any
       length to quench their desires for knowledge, and BOTH! are basicly
       harmless people who dont wish to take over the world, crash your
       hard drive, sell your information, or other things that have been
       called "pranks" (as if everyone hacking was from age 14-16) by
       our wonderfull american media.. One might also note that one of
       the bigest original-flavour hackers Steve Wozniack for a while
       actively took part in somthing that many of the modern day hackers
       share their intrest in: Blue Boxing. So you see, all these types
       of seperatist rhetoric that is spouted here and there are mostly
       unfounded. A few hackers who are basicly juvinile delinquents who
       happen to have computers give most other hackers a bad name...
       Okay, so take those lumps and swallow... its not so hard is it?

 Okay, you might want to as well check out any and all books by the
 following authors:

PREFACE:
~~~~~~~~
        OK doods, here's the spiel: A few months ago, I was playing on a
Payfone 190 and pressed a few buttons, and I got a - - - - display on the
clock screen. So, I typed in a few normal numbers (1234..etc) and the
display said p r o g, and I could dial for free! I found some manuals,
nicked them, and got Death Jester to scan them. So, here they are! BTW: One
thing that the manuals don't make clear is that the 'sleeping' PIN (in
self-contained versions) is 4358 for EVERY payfone - the bloke who owns the
fone doesn't generally change it, and as a result, if you can't hack the
master PIN, just enter 4358 and change the billing rates (999 seconds for
10p for any call within UK!!!!) so you still get a good deal!

PREFACE PT.2

        A quick trainspotters guide to the Payfone 190: It's a grey fone,
and it looks like a normal fone with a coinbox beneath it. They have them
mostly in pubs, clubs etc...

     Using the Payphone 190
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Receiving calls on the Payphone 190
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     When your Payphone 190 rings, answer the call
     normally.

     After lifting the handset, you will hear the payphone
     identification (cuckoo) tone (BEEP..BOP) to alert the
     operator that this is a payphone.  UK operators are
     trained not to connect transfer charge calls when they
     hear this tone.

     The display flashes the minimum fee for thirty seconds,
     which should be ignored.  Hereafter, the display will
     be blank for the meter pulsed version, or show the time
     of day for the self contained version.


     Making calls on the self contained Payphonel9O
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     (Press on Answer button fitted.)

  Note:  Only one coin can be inserted at any one time.

     With the handset in place the display is blank.  Lift the
     handset.

         display: minimum fee flashing  (after a short delay)

     You will hear the payphone identification (cuckoo) tone
     (BEEP..BOP).

     Insert a coin at least equal to the minimum fee.

                display      d I A L

     Dial the number you require.  When you have finished
     dialling you will see the following:

                display      POA  flashing

     When your call is answered

                  press      Press on Answer

                display      time remaining in seconds

     Ten seconds before the time remaining expires, you
     will hear the credit expiry tone (five rapid pips).  Insert
     a further coin if you wish to continue your call,
     otherwise your call will be cut off.

     Cut off at credit expiry occurs because the line is
     disconnected.  After two seconds dial tone is returned.

                display      increased time remaining

     At the end of your call, you may have sufficient credit
     remaining to make another call.  To do so, key the Next
     Call button instead of hanging up.  The display will sho
     the value of the credit remaining. (Me minimum fee
     will flash if insufficient credit remains) - Then dial the
     next number you require.

  Note:  Only wholly unused coins will be refunded when the
         handset is replaced.

       
     NOTE FROM /\Xi: Here it tells you about the meter pulsed 190 fone.
     As this is just the same as before, we didn't scan it.


     Using the Payphone 190 as an ordinary phone [This is the phun bit]
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Payphone 190 can be used as an ordinary
     telephone, to make calls without inserting coins.
     However, these calls will still be charged to your
     telephone bill.

  Note:  To use this facility you need to know your Personal
         Idenfificafion number (PIN).

     To make such a call:

     Begin with the handset in place.

       Key * twice (slowly), and the display shows - - - -

       Key your four digit PIN.

                display      prog  (if correct PIN is keyed)
                     or      FAIL  (if incorrectPIN is keyed).

     When p r o g is shown, pick up the handset, and dial the
     number you require.  You will not have to insert any
     coins.

     If you wish to make further calls of this type, instead of
     replacing the handset when you finish your first call,
     press the Next Call button.

     When you have finished all your calls, replace the
     handset, and further calls will be in payphone mode;
     that is, they will require coins.

     The audit facility (cash records)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Payphone 190 displays four records of cash data
     sequentially.  These are, in order of display:
      
     Ihe number of coins collected since the case was last
     opened.*
      
     The number of coins collected since the batteries were
     last removed for more than thirty seconds.
      
     The value of coins (in Pounds.pence) collected since the case was
     last opened.*
      
     The value of coins (in Pounds.pence) collected since the batteries
     were last removed for more than thirty seconds.
      
     CAUTION
     ~~~~~~~
     Do not insert the key, or unlock the case, except to
     remove the cash, unless otherwise instructed, as
     this will reset some of the cash records as if the
     cash  had  been  removed. The records that are reset
     are those above marked thus:*

     Viewing the records
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Begin with the handset in place.
     Key * twice (slowly), and the display shows - - -
     Key your four digit Personal Identification number
     (PIN).
           
                display      prog   (if correct PIN is keyed)
                     or      FAIL   (if incorrect PIN is keyed).



              With the display showing p r o g:

                    key      8

 Examples:      display      30     (coins collected since case last
                                    opened)
                display      60     coins collected since batteries
                                    removed)
                display      3. 0   (value of coins collected since
                                    case last opened)
                display      6. 0   (value of coins collected since
                                    batteries removed)
                display      prog

     You can now either leave the programming mode as
     described in the section 'Leaving the programming
     mode', or program other facilities.

     Note From /\Xi: The next bit is about the cashbox. We didn't bother
     scanning it..

     Programming the Payphone 190
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     CAUTION
     ~~~~~~~
     If, whilst programming your Payphone  190, the
     display shows - - - -, then you should key  ****
     which will cause the display to show F A I L followed
     by p r o g.  If however, keying **** causes a
     display of P P P P, then key your PIN followed by #


     Programming a personal identification number (PIN)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Payphone 190 requires programming with a PIN
     before the payphone can be used. Until this has been
     done, the display will show 9 9 9 whenever the handset
     is lifted. The PIN also allows the Payphone 190 to be
     used as an ordinary telephone, that is, to make calls
     without inserting coins. This programming may
     already have been done when the British Telecom
     engineer installed your payphone. If so, the display will
     be blank when the handset is in place.

     If not, the display will show - - - - and you must
     program your PIN now as follows:

     Choose a four digit PIN and key this on the keypad
     using any of the digits 0 to 9. The display will show the
     last four digits keyed.
  
  Note:  The * key, Next Call or Press on Answer buttons (if fitted)
         may also be used as part of your PIN if you require.
         These are shown as P, F and F respectively on the
         display.

     When you have the required PIN on the display, key #,
     and the display will flash p r o g.

     If you have a meter pulsed Payphone 190, you may now
     either program the time of day and any other facilities
     you may require, or key # again, and the display will
     show a steady p r o g. To clear the display, key Next Call.
     The payphone is now ready for use.

     If you have a self contained Payphone 190, you  must
     now program the time of day and day of week.


     Changing your personal identification number (PIN)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     We recommend that you change your PIN regularly in
     the interests of security. [Hehehehehe - /\><i]

     CAUTION
     ~~~~~~~
     Changing the PIN requires reprogramming all of
     the other Payphone 190 facilities you may have
     previously programmed. The audit facility cash
     records will also be reset.

     After changing your PIN, check the list of
     programmable facilities in the section 'Programming the
     payphone with other facilities' to reprogram the facilities
     you require.

     To change your PIN, follow the instructions below:

     CAUTION
     ~~~~~~~
     Unplug the connection to the telecommunications
     network before opening the battery compartment.

 1   Leave the handset in place.

 2   Open the case.

 3   Open the battery compartment, by unscrewing the
     single cross head screw at the higher end of the battery
     compartment cover.

 4   Remove at least one of the batteries.

 5   Wait for at least five minutes.

 6   Replace battery (ensure it faces the correct way).

 7   Close the battery compartment and screw shut.

 8   Close and lock the case.
     The display will now show - - - -

 9   Choose a new four digit PIN and key this on the
     keypad using any of the digits 0 to 9. The display will
     show the last four digits keyed.

  Note:  The * key, Next Call or Press on Answer buttons (if fitted)
         may also be used as part of your PIN if you require.
         These are shown as P, F and F respectively on the
         display.

 10  When you have the required PIN on the display, key
     and the display will flash p r o g.
     If you have a meter pulsed Payphone 190, you may now
     program the facilities you require, or if none are
     required, key # again, and the display will show a
     steady p r o g. To clear the display, key Next Call. The
     payphone is now ready for use.


     If you have a self contained Payphone 190, you must
     now program the time of day and day of week and then
     any other facilities you require.

     Programming the payphone with other facilities
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     To program your Payphone 190 with other facilities
     (apart from a PIN) it is necessary to:

        - enter  the  programming  mode
        - perform the required programming
        - and then leave the programming mode.

     A programming template is provided as an aide
     memoirs to assist in programming additional features
     on the payphone.  This may be found at the back of this
     guide. [Note From /\><i - It's a shit template....]

  Note:  It is important that you decide how you wish to
         program each of these facilities, as they can affect the
         amount of money collected by your Payphone 190.  In
         particular, those marked * below must be checked and
         changed if necessary.

     Programmable facilities:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o   Time of day.

    o   Day of week.

    o   Loop disconnect or tone dialling.

    o   Cash compartment size.

    o   PABX access digits and pause.

    o   The audit facility (cash records).

    o   Directory enquiry numbers. *


     Entering the programming Mode
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Begin with the handset in place.
       Key * twice (slowly), and the display shows - - - -
        Key your four digit PIN.


                display      prog   (if correct PIN is keyed)
                     or      FAIL   (if incorrect PIN is keyed).

  Note:  If display shows F A I L, indicating that an incorrect PIN
         has been entered, the payphone will then revert back to
         the start of the sequence with the display blank.
         When the display shows p r o g you are in the
         programming mode.

     If three unsuccessful attempts are made to key the PIN,
     You cannot retry for thirty seconds. This is to avoid
     unauthorised users from trying to discover the PIN by
     repeated attempts.[Hehehehe]

     NOTE FROM /\><i - There are a few commands we've missed out - 
     programming time, date etc..

     Programming loop disconnect or tone dialling
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The Payphone 190 is capable of dialling numbers using
     the pulsed (loop disconnect) or dual tone signalling
     (tone) system.  The phone is preset to use the loop
     disconnect system and this need not be changed.
     However, it can be programmed to use the tone
     system. This is often the preferred system when
     connecting your Payphone 190 to a private exchange
     (PABX).

     Enter the programming mode as described previously
     in this section.

     With the display showing p r o g:
              
                    key      1

                display      previous setting   (LOOP or tonE)

                    key      *      to change between LOOP or tonE as
                                    required.
                    key      #

                display      prog
          
     You can now either leave the programming mode as
     described at the end of this section, or programme any
     other facilities you require.

     Programming PABX access digits and pause
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     General
     ~~~~~~~
     This is only necessary if you have a self contained
     Payphone 190 which is connected as an extension to a
     PABX (telephone switchboard) which requires access
     digit(s) to be dialled and a pause, before dialling the
     number to be called. The Payphone 190 will
     automatically insert the digit(s) and pause; the user
     need only dial the number required.

     The PABX pause is normally set to three seconds.
     Alternative settings depend on the type of PABX you
     have.

     On PABX systems which return a secondary proceed
     indication (dial tone), the delay should be set to not
     less than three seconds for loop disconnect, and not
     less than four seconds for dual tone working (see note).
     on PABX systems which do not return a secondary
     proceed indication (dial tone), the pause should be set
     to zero (see note) to speed up the progress of the call
     and eliminate a possible premature time out of some
     PABXs.

     Consult your PABX supplier for further information.

  Note:  The pause setting shown on the display in the case of
         loop disconnect dialling is increased automatically by
         0.8 seconds.  For example, setting a delay of 3 seconds
         gives a total delay of 3.8 seconds, and setting a delay of
         zero gives a total delay of 0.8 seconds.

     Programming
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Enter the programming mode as described previously
     in this section.

     With the display showing p r o g:

                    key      5

                display      previous access digit(s)

example         display      PA-9 or PA--

                    key      the one or two digits that are required
                             by the PABX as prefix digits to obtain an
                             exchange line.

example             key      7  for a PABX that requires a 7 as a
                             prefix digit to obtain an exchange line

                display      PA-7

     (To clear display, key * twice (slowly) until display
     shows PA-- .)

                    key      #

     If access digit(s) have been keyed, display now shows
     previous pause:

example         display      P P 3

     (If no access digits have been keyed, display goes
     straight to p r o g.)

                    key      one digit  (from 0 to 9) which is the
                             delay in seconds required by the PABX
                             between the prefix digit(s) and the
                             number to be called.

                    key      #

                display      p r o g

     You can now either leave the programming mode as
     described at the end of this section, or programme any
     other facilities you require.

     Leaving the programming mode
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     When you have completed the programming you
     require, you must leave the programming mode as
     follows:

                display      p r o g

     Lift handset to obtain dial tone then replace handset, or

                  Press      Next Call  (if the Payphone 190 is not
                             connected to the telephone line), or

                  Press      Press on Answer  (if fitted)

     The display is blank.
     You have now left the programming mode.

     CAUTION
     ~~~~~~~
     Do not leave the payphone in the programming
     mode or the battery life will be reduced.

     Transfer charge calls
     Operators making calls to the Payphone 190 will hear a
     payphone identification (cuckoo) tone (BEEP..BOP).
     UK operators are trained not to connect transfer
     charge calls when they hear this tone. Intemational
     transfer charge calls cannot always be detected this
     way and may be connected. If this occurs, the charges
     will appear on your bill, but the payphone will not
     collect cash. [I'm sure you can imagine the scope for that - /\><i]

     The only sure way to prevent any reverse charge calls
     being made to your payphone is to bar incoming calls
     altogether. British Telecom can arrange this for you.
     There may be a small charge for this service.

     Entering the normal programming mode
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     If you have forgotten your PIN, refer to the section in the
     main Product Guide entitled 'Changing your Personal
     Identification Number'.

     Begin with the handset in place.

     Key * twice (slowly), and the display shows - - - -

     Key your four digit PIN.

                display      prog   (if correct PIN is keyed)
                     or      FAIL   (if incorrect PIN is keyed).

     If display shows F A I L, indicating that an incorrect PIN
     has been entered, the payphone will then revert back to
     the start of the sequence with the display blank.
     When the display shows p r o g, you are in the normal
     programming mode.

     If three unsuccessful attempts are made to key the PIN,
     you cannot retry for thirty seconds. This is to avoid
     unauthorised users from trying to discover the PIN by
     repeated attempts.

     Entering the self contained programming mode
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Once in the normal programming mode, with the display
     showing p r o g:

     Key * twice (slowly), and the display shows - - - -

     Key the four digit'sleeping' PIN.

     The'sleeping'PIN is a preprogrammed personal
     identification number.  This number is 4358.

                display      F E E S (if correct PIN is keyed)
                     or      F A I L (if incorrect PIN is keyed).

     If display shows F A I L, indicating that an incorrect
     sleeping PIN has been entered, the payphone will then
     revert back to the start of the sequence with the display
     showing p r o g. Rekey the sleeping PIN.
     When the display shows F E E S, you are in the self
     contained programming mode.

     If three unsuccessful attempts are made to key the
     sleeping PIN, you cannot retry for thirty seconds.  This is
     to avoid unauthorised users from trying to discover the
     sleeping PIN by repeated attempts.

     CAUTION
     ~~~~~~~
     The following procedures enable you to program
     certain facilities on the Payphone 190.  If for any
     reason, however, the payphone is allowed to power
     down (that is, the batteries are removed for more
     than 30 seconds), this data will be lost.

	A BIT ABOUT CORDLESS PHONES AND EAVESDROPPING
	=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The original cordless phones use two sets of radio frequencies, one at
49MHZ and one at about 1.9GHZ - just about the AM broadcast band. (You need
a pair of channels so that both speakers can talk simultaneously and not
have to 'hand over' each time as you do on traditional radio systems.) The
1.9GHZ transmissions use the mains power lead as the antenna. The radios
have a range of about 100-200 metres. When cordless phones were legalised
in the UK, the 49MHZ band was substituted by a handful of channels at
47MHZ. The newer US standard - which is used illegally elsewhere, abandons
the 1.9GHZ band altogether and has its pair at 49MHZ and 46MHZ, radio
design having improved to the point where you can have transmit and recieve
frequencies that are close together without interference.

Looking for cordless phone traffic, therefore, means little more than
placing your reciever within 200 metres of your target and scanning between
46MHZ and 49MHZ until you hear what you are looking for. Thereafter, having
found the spot frequency of your target's phone, you can simply leave the
scanner tuned and connected to a tape recorder. If your target is using a
cordless phone with a 1.9GHZ 'base transmit', you can monitor on a
communications reciever, and enjoy a slightly better range. 

N.B. There are security devices on cordless phones, of which you may have
heard, but these are intended , not to stop the eavsdropping, but to
prevent the use of a handset to hijack someone else's line - the line will
only open if the correct digital code (Normally 14digits+) is sent from the
handset to the base.

There are however new developments in the UK, pertaining to cordless
phones, these new developments being seen in the form of CT2 technology.
Although I cannot be sure of it I believe that the new 'RABBIT' phones
which are now emerging here in the UK are using this technology. Basically
these new phones allow you to connect your base to your home/office phone
line and also due to strategically placed recievers and transmitters in the
high streets throughout the country allow you to walk around the streets
with the phone as if it were a cellphone, but only paying normal rates. The
CT2 technology will become a hazard to us electronic eavsdroppers and
information seekers as the speech is digitised prior to transmission, so
unless you are able to construct a decoder all you will hear is the same as
modem transmissions.

 Disclaimer: You should know that it is illegal to listen in on radio 
             telephone conversations of any sort, cordless, maritime,
             or cellular. You should also know that all of the folling
             information is available in countless nationaly published
             magazines or books. Remember, its not always the information,
             itself but how you use it that makes that information
             dangerous.

 Okay, Hello and welcome to what I hope to be a very informative file on
 the art of "listening in" as it were, on the telephone calls, voice
 pagers and other telephone-radio communications of private citizens.
 This file will contain what I have found most lacking in all few other
 files on this subject, actual how-to factual information. So plug in
 your scanner, put on your headfones, and lets go...
 
 

 PART ONE: Cordless Telephones: America's Mini Talk-Radio Station.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Cordless fones do not operate on the same concept of the radio mobile
 telephones now known as cellular fones. They do however, operate using
 radio waves. The main concept is that the cordless fone is devided into
 two parts: the base, and the handset. The base is the part of the fone
 that connects to the subscriber's line, and as well broadcasts to the
 handset the conversation on the fone in two parts. One part is received
 directly from the subscriber's line (from the person talking on the
 other end of the fone) and the other part is received from the handset
 itself (which like a normal fone, loops whatever is said into the mouth-
 piece back to the speaker). The Second part of the cordless fone is the
 abeforementioned handset. The handset performs all the regular functions
 of a standard fone in addition to broadcasting what is said into the 
 mouthpiece to the base of the fone. 
 
 Okay, now that we know all of this, it is simple to surmise that there
 must be a standard set of frequencies that are used for these fones.
 You can say what you will about the FCC, (and I probably said it at
 sometime myself as well!), but in addition to being the fascists they
 are, they do make it easy for us to know exactly which frequencies
 any and all agencies are ALOWED to operate on. Yes, its true... these
 devices must operate on their aloted frequencies.. they can not just
 bounce around anywhere they choose in the electro-magnetic spectrum.
 Okay, well now we know this, so all we need to know are the specifics
 of what frequencies they opperate on, and we are in business. Well,
 as Lee "Scratch" Perry would say.. "Here we go..."
 
 Cordless fones opperate on two sets of frequencies, one set belongs to
 the handset and the other to the base. The one to scan primarily is
 the set that belongs to the base. The reason for this is that the 
 base transmits both what is coming into the line from the outside and
 what is being said by you. The handset only transmits what is being
 said into the mouthpiece itself by the owner of the cordless fone.
 You may want to program the handset frequencies in your scanner 
 because at times the signal is stronger comming from the handset, but
 then, whats the point to listening to half of a fone call... well
 youd be supprised at what you can hear from only half of the call.

 NOTE: Another problem with monitoring the handset frequencies is that
       they coincide with the small set of baby montior frequencies.
       You know what a baby monitor is dont you? Its a clever little
       device designed for 30-somthing yuppies so that they can 
       continue their sex filled life style without worying about
       a damn baby being in the room. So the reciever stays in the
       parents room, and the transmitter goes in the babys room..
       Whatever noises that eminate from the baby's room are 
       transmitted to the reciever.. all of this includes often
       times: fights, family discussions, stupid television shows,
       crying (of course), etc etc.. Anyways, for posterity's sake
       the baby monitor fequencies will follow.. I have at times
       found them to be mildly amusing (like an irate father losing
       his patience in trying to quiet his crying son), but I think
       it was said best on The Simpsons: "Baby to Marge, Baby to 
       Marge, Wahhh Wahhh. Over."

       Baby Monitor Frequencies:
       -------------------------
       Channel 01   49.83   mhz
       Channel 02   49.845  mhz
       Channel 03   49.86   mhz
       Channel 04   49.875  mhz
       Channel 05   49.89   mhz


 Okay, with that out of the way, here are the frequencies aloted to
 cordless fones, both base and handset. Please note, all frequencies
 are in megahertz.

          Base Frequencies:            Handset Frequencies
          -----------------            -------------------
          Channel 01  46.61            Channel 01  49.67
          Channel 02  46.63            Channel 02  49.77
          Channel 03  46.67            Channel 03  49.83
          Channel 04  46.71            Channel 04  49.845
          Channel 05  46.73            Channel 05  49.86
          Channel 06  46.77            Channel 06  49.875
          Channel 07  46.83            Channel 07  49.89
          Channel 08  46.87            Channel 08  49.93
          Channel 09  46.93            Channel 09  49.97
          Channel 10  46.97            Channel 10  49.99

 Okay, so for those of you not experienced with scanning, the remaining
 task would simply be to program the above frequencies into your 
 scanner (even a cheap non searching scanner), and just scan through
 those programs until one of them became active. 

 Listening in on these calls is hampered only by a few remote situations.
 The first and most obvious is due to how far away the cordless fone
 is from your scanner. The second, called intermod (intermodulation) or
 cross talk, is caused by too many cordless fones being operated in
 the same area at the same time. The cordless fones go uneffected by
 this in most situations. The biggest area for this problem is in
 apartment buildings where alot of people are fit into a smaller 
 area. As said before, the cordless fones go uneffected, simply searching
 through channels until it finds one that is "free", however, when
 a scanner tries to listen in on two conversations going on at once
 on one frequency the signal is distorted with what is called Intermod
 (short for intermodulation) or cross talk. One example of this would
 be to consider a scinerio involving three different locations that 
 we'll call points A, B and C. At point A and C are cordless fones in
 the process of making calls. At point B is john q. scanner, listening
 in on fone conversations. He starts listening in on A, no problems,
 but then sudenly his speaker is filled with skwawks and huming and
 static as caller C picks up his fone and begins to make a call.
 Its somthing I like to call the Cordless-Crush.. You are crushed
 right in the middle of two fones making two calls on the same 
 frequency. Both fones are far enough apart to make the calls on the
 same frequency, but you being in the middle pick both of them up.
 Now take that situation, and put it into the perspective of an apartment
 where 10 people or more on one floor could have cordless fones, and
 you, right in the middle of it all. Confusing.. to say the least.

 Alright, so now you know how its done, and you know some of the
 pitfalls that can be encountered, now onto the best methods to 
 maximize your reception.

 1. Amplifiers and Sensitivity & Selectivity.
 --------------------------------------------

 More important than the antenae is what is called the sensitivity of
 the scanner. Cordless fones do not vary in the amount of watage they
 use to transmit, but scanne sensitivity varies greatly amoung
 different brands and models. A good scanner compared to one of lesser
 quality may mean the difference between hearing a conversation a
 block away or missing out on it entirely. If you are serious about 
 scanning, it is wise to get the most sensitive scanner your money can
 buy. Even though you can pick up a scanner for under $100 in alomst
 any pawn shop, it is worth the money to get a scanner with a good
 amount of sensitivity and selectivity. Selectivity is the scanners
 ability to discern one frequency from another when they are very
 close. For example, a radio with a high degree of selectivity would
 have no problem picking up that distant college radio station that
 was previously blasted off the dial by its more powerful neighboor
 the religious station. Sensitivity isnt just a nice word to use
 when saying "this scanner is more sensitive than that scanner", it
 is actualy a highly percice calculation that is made by one of 
 two ways. One way the 20 decibel signal-to-noise ratio, calculates
 sensitivity by measuring how much signal strength is required for
 a scanner to reproduce the sound 20dB louder than the original
 signal. The decibel (abreviated dB) is a method of measuring 
 comparative changes in power. dB is either in gain or in loss. When
 you gain a dB you gain 26% more than your previous dB. When you
 loose a dB you loose 11% less than the last dB. The other way, the
 12dB SINAD method is quite similar to the 20dB S/N method but uses
 a much more complicated formula to determine sensitivity. Basicly
 it all works out to determining what the lowest signal stregth
 measured in uV (microvolts) the scanner can reproduce at 20db S/N
 or 12db SINAD. The lower the number, the better the sensitivity.
 Okay, so you know a little bit more about sensitivity than you did
 before, or cared to... oh well, I put this in because I find radio
 electronic theory interesting and firgure that some other people may
 as well. To finish up this section quickly, you can increase your
 scanners sensitivity with an amplifier. These handy little devices
 can increase your sensitivity by almost 20db, so they are worth it
 at a usual 50 dollars. As well, if you want to pick up distant
 signals, you should buy or build your own antenae for the specific
 frequencies you want to pick up. There are many many books writen
 on antenae theory and I am not going to explain how to create your
 own. Believe it or not, its out of the scope of this file and, odds
 are, if you have a scanner, you have a whip or coil antenae attached
 to it that will do just fine until you want to get something
 better. 



 PART TWO: Voice Pagers, or "Beep.. Dont forget to pick up the kids.."
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Okay, so you are a construction worker, or a doctor, or a plumber,
 or a hot-shot gangta who's home fone is tapped.. For all of the 
 above people, pagers are a big part of life. Pagers come in a number
 of forms, the one-way radio voice pager and the digital pager being
 the most common of the lot. As listening to a digital pager is alot
 like playing your old C64 data tapes, we will concentrate on radio
 pagers. As well as cordless, cellular, ship to shore etc calls, it
 is illegal to listen in on radio pagers as well. Howerver, those who
 have found themselves unable to keep awaym, have found that radio
 pagers are a often times interesting source of (sometimes meaningless)
 chatter. Basicly with one way radio pagers, from the broadcasting site
 you send out a message to so and so's voice pager and they pick it 
 up on what looks alot like a hand held reciever. I'm not aware of 
 much more information on the actual operating procedures of the 
 pager systems but as I said, these messages are sent over the airwaves
 and reach their destination un-encrypted. Okay, now we'll jump right
 into the meat-n-potatoes of this section with a complete completer
 completest list of known radio paging frequencies.

 ** I have to give credit for this info to POPULAR COMMUNICATIONS
    magazine, an excelent magazine for the scanner, hammer, jammer and
    shortwave listener. Most paging fequncies are public knowledge, and
    available in any magazine or book about scanning but I have never
    seen such a complete list presented any place else. This is no ad,
    but, it covers pirate radio, unusual and government frequencies as
    well.. all in all a good read. So Check it out.                      **

 Okay, now, after that shameless promotion, here is the list of 
 frequencies where you MAY find radio pagers. Understand that not all
 are in use at all places in the United States, but doing some scanning
 should suss out which frequencies are active.

                                                         Paging Channels.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some notes concerning the above listing:
 ----------------------------------------

 As you can see, some of the frequencies are listed with their channel
 designator code. These codes are by no means official, and those 
 frequencies listed with channel designators are in use primarily by
 the Common Carriers and Radio Common Carriers who sell voice/digital
 pagers to private citizens. (You know who the Common Carriers are dont
 you? They are the companies that provide your telephone needs for all
 of the calls you make outside your lata. That is, the big boys, AT&T,
 Sprint, MCI.. etc.. MCI is hardly a big boy as far as I'm concerned..
 but that is just a personal preference..) Those channels shown without
 designators are available for private use by medical, construction, 
 and other similar groups.
 
 Here is an aproximation of the above frequencies and their intended use:
  
 27 MHz: Basicly small 4watt voice/nonvoice pager systems developed for
         hospitals, shopping malls, corporations, busineses, and other
         small areas.. They have a range of several miles

 929.3625 - 929.4625 
 929.6376 - 926.9875: These are private carrier paging services used
                      by police, federal agents, fire officers etc..


 You should as well check out the following frequencies for pagers as they
 too have been known to carry pager signals:

  72 MHz -  76 MHz  Some Fixed (point to point) radio links used by pagers

 851 MHz - 869 MHz  
 935 MHz - 940 MHz  SMRS licenses may provide paging services here

 162.60 MHz - 174.00 MHz  Often used by federal agency pagers

 164.175  MHz - Goddard Space Flight Center (Md) paging system.
 164.975  MHz - Brookhaven National Laboratories (N.Y.)
 165.2625 MHz - St. Elizabeth's Hospital (D.C.)

 406 MHz - 420 MHz  Also check here for federal agency pagers, for 
                    example:

 414.90 MHz  New York City area federal agency pager

 In the future, you may check out 930 - 931 MHz, a frequency range recently
 allocated for pager use and possibly 901 - 902 MHz and 940 - 941 MHz ranges
 that may soon be allocated for use.

 As well, before 800 MHz cellular fones became popular people used the 
 land mobile services offered in the 470-512 MHz UHF T band. Now these
 frequencies have been allocated for use by pager systems, so you should
 as well check there. Here is a list of some metropolitan areas that
 are using this band for paging, your city may not be listed, but as I
 said, check out 470 - 512 MHz, and see what you find.
 

 470.0125 - 470.2875 MHz
 482.0125 - 482.2875 MHz  Boston, Massachusets

 470,0125 - 470.2875 MHz
 476.0125 - 476.2875 MHz  Chiago, Illinois, Cleaveland, Ohio
                          New York City, North East New Jersey.

 482.0125 - 482.2875 MHz  Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas

 476.0125 - 476.2875 MHz
 482.0125 - 482.2875 MHz  Detroit, Michigan

            488.2875 MHz  Houston, Texas

            506.0625 MHz
            506.0875 MHz
            506.1125 MHz  Los Angeles, California

 470.0125 - 470.2875 MHz  Miami, Florida

 500.0125 - 500.2875 MHz  
 506.0125 - 506.2875 MHz  Philadelphia, Pennslyvania

 470.0125 - 470.2875 MHz  Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania

 482.0375 - 482.2875 MHz
 488.0375 - 488.2875 MHz  San Francisco, California

 488.0128 - 488.2875 MHz
 494.0125 - 494.2875 MHz  Washington, D.C.



 PART THREE: I cant think of anything clever to say about ship to shore.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Well, I cant say much about the Maratime Public Coast, which ofers 
 marine telephone services as I have not seen a large amount of 
 information concerning this facility anywhere. If anyone has any sort
 of information on the opperations of this facility or its structure 
 please let me know. Well, Regardless, It is a great misnomer to think
 that modern radios do not include the ability to scan the ship to 
 shore radio frequencies. For whatever you want to scan you can find
 a scanner that will cover those frequencies, however you dont even need
 a wide area scanner to scan the ship to shore frequencies which mostly
 fall into a band that is commonly available to most scanners. Okay so
 here are the frequencies and channels used for ship to shore telephone
 calls:
 
 Ship Channels                Shore Channels          
 -----------------------      -----------------------
 Channel 24  157.200 MHz      Channel 24  161.800 MHz
 Channel 84  157.225 MHz      Channel 84  161.825 MHz
 Channel 25  157.250 MHz      Channel 25  161.850 MHz
 Channel 85  157.275 MHz      Channel 85  161.875 MHz
 Channel 26  157.300 MHz      Channel 26  161.900 MHz
 Channel 86  157.325 MHz      Channel 86  161.925 MHz
 Channel 27  157.350 MHz      Channel 27  161.950 MHz
 Channel 87  157.375 MHz      Channel 87  161.975 MHz
 Channel 28  157.400 MHz      Channel 28  162.000 MHz

 
 Okay, so those are the only ship to shore radio frequencies that I have.
 Let me make one thing clear though, that there is a difference between
 Marine VHF frequencies that ships use to talk to each other and these
 above listed ship to shore Maritime Public Coast frequencies. The MPC
 frequencies are those that are used by the boaters and ships that which
 to make calls from their boats to the shore. All calls that need to be
 made from a boat need to be made via the MPC... As well, is needed a
 common carrier to route the call.. putting this all together, as many
 have before, you can see that if you monitor these frequencies you
 will here many people entering or speaking their calling card numbers..
 Well this is all fine and great, but before you think about getting your
 radio out, let me tell you this, if there is an amount of abuse comming
 from a particular area, and it turns out that it is all from various
 ships and boats using the MPC, you will soon find someone in a black
 and blue K-Mart suit joining you down at the sea shore and they wont
 be there for a picknick... Oh well, just thought I'd mention that.



 PART FOUR: Chapter the last... Ceulluar Telephones & Joe Average.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

 I'll start our last section off with a note about a file that came
 out a while back about listening in on cellular fones. The intent
 of this last section was not to say, yeah, their are cordless fone
 conversations going on in such and such a band, go out and check 'em
 out... This last section was inspired by the previously mentioned
 file as you will soon see, and designed for ANYONE to listen in...
 you dont even need a scanner. Anyways, the file stated that with the
 aid of a cordless fone placed near to an antenaed television set you
 could hear cellular telephone conversations on channels 81 to 83.
 Well, I dont happen to have a cordless fone, and havent been able to
 get the time to actually go to somebodys house who has a television
 set with an antenate (mostly are now just cable ready with no antenae)
 AND a cordless fone.. so I havent been able to check out if that
 particular method is any better than mine.. As it turns out you dont
 nessisarly need a cordless fone near the television, just as was
 mentioned a televison set WITH ANTENAE (make sure its connected too!!
 This sounds dumb but hell, how many people out there are not
 connected to the cable television system..? not many, and usualy the
 antenae goes unconnected.) There is also a change in the channels
 that you can check out and find cellular calls on, you can find them
 from channel 70 all to channell 83 (the last channel in the old
 UHF tv dials). Just turn on your televison and check out these channels
 and you will eventualy hear some chatter from ceullular telephones.
 Some of it is louder, and some quieter depending on the location
 of the caller. One problem I have noticed is that alot of the conversation
 is one way.. that is, you are only picking up the mobile frequency..
 however, as all radio telephone services are, the cellular service
 is paired and that other end may be lurking somewhere up the dial.. So
 If you find only half of a conversation, do a little more looking and
 you MAY find the other half, or even the whole thing!

 Clearing up some mystery about this little miracle: The UHF television
 frequencies run from 470 MHz (low end of channel 14) to 890 MHz (high
 end of channel 83). Well cellular fones primarily operate between 
 869 MHz and 894 MHz. This isnt some sort of mistake that the FCC made,
 the frequencies that used to make up channel 70 - 83 on your tevlevision
 set that were not being used at all were re-allocated for use by the land
 mobile radio telephones.

 One quick note: Although this section was not intended to cover any sort
 of scanner use concerning cellular calls, I would like to note that If
 you think that it is nessiarily expensive to purchase a scanner with
 800 - 1000 MHz (1ghz) capability, its really not. A scanner converter
 can be purchased (or better yet, built, check out Radio Electronics
 February 1992 issue) that wiil convert the 800 - 1000 mhz frequencies
 down to your 470 - 512 MHz scanner.



 THE END PART:
 -------------
 
 Okay, well, I hope you found a bit of this file interesting or can put
 the information to your own devious use.. Greets go out to all corners
 of the land to all the PHATE members. And KC, I hope to see you back 
 into the scene soon man! I'll be talkin to ya soon!

      A BRIEF GUIDE TO THE POLICE NATIONAL COMPUTER 2 (PNC 2) U.K.
	=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Introduction:
-------------

	Hi all, SLYCATH here and this is just Another of my many
	contributions to this month's Mag.
	Ok this is part ONE of a brief guide to the PNC computer version 2.
	This will only be useful if you can actually get into a cop shop,
	it's always better to know someone inside rather than try and sneak 
	in. The reason I have created this article is that this is a
	subject NOBODY has writted about EVER BEFORE in ANY other disk
	magazines, so I thought "If it benefits Just 1 person in any way
	then it will be worth the trouble" and anyway it will broaden 
	your minds to a totally new system which I know hardly any (!) will 
	know anything about.
	So Here Goes.........................................

 	And If You like it then tell me Coz i'll write part 2 !!


P.N.C. 2 ENQUIRY SCREEN
-----------------------
All transactions carried out are recorded at the Computer Centre, Hendon.

An integral part of the interface system is the ability to record details
of PNC transactions locally. Every transaction carried out through the
interface is recorded on th Interface Equipment at Bradford.

Here is an example Interface Logging Screen:

 .........................................................................
 .									.
 .			PNC ENQUIRER DETAILS				.
 .									.
 .									.
 .	1	Enquirer	[			]		.
 . 									.
 . 									.
 . 									.
 .	2	Force Enquiry	[  ]					.
 .									.
 .	3	Reason Code	[   ]					.
 .									.
 .	4	Location	[				]	.
 .									.
 . 									.
 . Enter F,field number							. 
 .									.
 .........................................................................


ENQUIRER,
---------
	This field is completed by entering the collar numbar, in respect
of PC's and Sgts; the Post Number in respect of Police Support Staff; or
the callsign in respect of Police Officers of the rank of Inspector or
Above.

	Entry of this information will result in a check being made against
a personnel file within the system and an appropriate reply will be
recieved from the computer.

	e.g. The entry of < 3229 > in the enquirer field will result in the
following display:-

		PC/B/SPEIGHT
		27/01/71

	This display indicates that the enquirer is authorised and that the
enquirer's date of joining is 27/01/71. This will facilitate the
verification of enquirer details.

FORCE,
------
	Circumstances will arise however, where enquirer identification
cannot be directly linked with personnel records. Inspectors and other
officers working in Headquaters Departments fall into this category.

	In these circumstances appropriate information should be entered in
the ENQUIRER FIELD. e.g. < Inspector Jenkins >.

	This will result in the remainder of the enquirer field being left
blank and the cursor being positioned in the force field. This field will
now be mandatory.

	The entry of < Y > indicates that the enquirer is legitimate and
that the operator wishes to force the enquiry past the personnel system.
The remainder of the format is completed as follows and the PNC response
can be recieved.

	NOTE.
	-----
	A no trace response from the personnel system does not indicate
that the enquirer is not entitled to accept PNC information. This response
merely indicates that the enquirer is not recorded on the personell system.
If this field is completed with an 'N' the transaction logging screen will
be deleted and the transaction response from the PNC will be abandoned and
not displayed.

REASON,
-------
	PNC 2 operates a system of National reason codes. The entry of a
valid reason code will result in the automatic display of an explanatory
literal.
	e.g. the entry of the reason code 1 will result in the following:-

	Reason [1]  VEHICLE OR PERSON STOPPED

The following PNC reason codes are National and must be used in all
transactions.

	CODE	REASON
	----	------

	 1	VEHICLE OR PERSON STOPPED

	 2	MOVING VEHICLE

	 3	ABANDONED VEHICLE / UNACCOMPANIED PROPERTY

	 4	R.T.A.

	 5	PROCESS / INVESTIGATION ENQUIRY

	 6	ADMINISTRATION ENQUIRY

	 7	CHILD ACCESS

	 8	ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER AGENCY

	 9	UPDATING / BROADCAST TRANSACTION

	10	AUDITING

	----	------


LOCATION,
--------
	The location of the subject of the transaction,
	In the majority of cases this will be a valid location. However, on
occasions the location of the enquirer may be more appropriate,
	e.g. < CID Admin. > or < Vehicle reported stolen >.

	It is advisable that as much detail as possible is recorded in this
field. Information accurately recorded may be of value in any subsequent
enquiry. For example, in a missing person enquiry it is insufficient to
merely record < misper enquiry >, it is better practice to include the name
of the person also.

	IT MAY BE ANTICIPATED HOWEVER, THAT THE MAJORITY OF PNC CHECKS
CARRIED OUT IN CUSTODY AREAS WILL FALL WITHIN REASON CODE 5, AND THAT THE
LOCATION WILL BE SHOWN AS < CUSTODY AREA - [LOCATION] >.A



At the completion of the transaction logging screen the operator will be
given the opportunity of selecting a field number in order to amend any of
the field in the format. The entry of 'F' will file the information onto an
Audit log and permit the reciept of the PNC response.


HERE IS A HELPFUL TIP FOR ALL YOU NAUGHTY BOYS AND GIRLS (Heheheheh):

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Identity of the operator is NOT required as part of transaction logging|
| as all transactions will be accredited to the operator currently logged on.|
| The operator Identity will be displayed on the bottom line of the VDU      |
| screen and will be printed as a part of all responses from the Audit log.  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|


THE PERSON CONCEPT
------------------

	Each record held on this application relates to one person and will
contain information appropriate to the reason for their prescence on the
system.

	It consists of the NOMINAL information 
	 (personal identification details),

		NAME
		AGE ( D.O.B.)
		SEX
		COLOUR
		HEIGHT.
	
Nominal Information is supported by one or a combination of the following
elements:- NIB, Wanted/Missing, Disqualified Driver.

THE PNC ID,
----------

	Each record created on the Names Application will be allocated a
unique PNC reference number called the PNC ID. The PNC ID consists of a 2
figure year element followed by a sequential number, of up to 7 figures,
and a check letter.

	e.g. 90/57129D

	Migrated records from the old PNC were allocated a PNC ID according 
to the year the person was first recorded.

	The PNC ID will ALWAYS be displayed on a person's Nominal page.

ENQUIRIES,
---------

	The transaction code #NE is used for ALL enquiries, whether using a
persons NASCH factors, or using a unique number, the #NE transaction can be
carried out either with or without a format.

                   NUArdialer Version 2.0A Documentation
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   ANOTHER TRIPPLE-PHAT -PHATE- RELEASE!
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   !ALL RIGHTS OF THE HARDCORE RESERVED!
                   -------------------------------------

Disclaimer: These things are pretty popular arent they? Well here it is:
I, the creator of this soft, take no responsibility for its usage what-
soever, no how, no way... Dont come crying to me about anything! I wrote
this as an experiment and nothing else... Its yr own damn business what
you do with it and I dont wanna know anyways..

WHAT IT IS:
-----------

Okay, now that bits over with... i'm happy to release this fine product
NUARdialer Telenet Scanner. Version 2.0a. This proggy is a lil' AREXX
script for use with the worlds sorriest term program in the world:

BAUDBANDIT II V2.X

Gee, whyd you make it for such a naff term anyways? Well, as i have
yet to find a great term program that is actualy usefull to me and 
completely bug free, and as well has an AREXX port, i made it for this
little 50k term program... You can stick it (the term) wherever, and
not worry about its config file... no fuss no muss.. I'm still using
Jr-Comm myself, because Term V2.4 RANKS, is too slow and buggy, and
i havent checked out the lastest X-Comm, and Terminus hasnt been
released bug free. If there really is a need, or a request, i will
write this scanner for the popular vote. Besides, it was the first 
term when i started writing this thing that didnt give me trouble just
outputing somthing to screen... anyways...


THE SPECS:
----------

I have really no idea how amazingly fast that this scanner works. It
will do the standard deal depending on how many connections you get..
the more connections, the slower it will take to scan through the area
(because connecting to a system, and disconnecting takes 3 times as long
as getting an error message and continuing). The program is sufficently
fast however, and you should hav no problems scanning through an 
area over night... To note, this scanner is not soley capbable of scanning
telenet dnics. As you should know, you can reach many other networks
through telenet, and these networks are equally scannable with this 
programm. Of course however, not all networks are reachable and those
that are not give contant REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION responses.


FEATURES:
---------

 1. CONFIGURATION FILE FOR AUTOMATED STARTUP
 2. CONFIGURATION FILE THAT REMEMBERS YOUR TELENET DIALUP
 3. SMART PATHS THAT SEND THE SAVE FILE TO WHATEVER PATH YOU SELECT
 4. RECORDS ALL CONNECT, REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION, AND BUSY RESPONSES
 5. ORGANIZED OUTPUT FILE THAT MAKES RE-EDITING QUICK AND EASY


HOW TO USE IT:
--------------

Okay, well, the basic opperation of the scanner depends on two text
files entitled NUARDIALER.CFG1 and NUARDIALER.CFG2 respectively.
You can run the scanner without CFG2 but you CAN'T run it witout
CFG1. Both of these files need to be in your SYS:S directory.

NUARDIALER.CFG1:
----------------

This file contains two items. on the first line is the modem dial 
string to connect to Telenet. This can be whatever you use to
connect including commas, disable call waiting commands... any
acceptable AT command is valid here. The second line of this file
is where to store the output text. This does not include a directory
slash at the end. For example, DH3:HPA/CAPTURE would be correct,
whereas DH3:HPA/CAPTURE/, will not work.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE CONTENTS OF NUARDIALER.CFG1:
----------------------------------------------

ATDT*70,18002220555		 <- THIS IS THE MODEM DIAL STRING
DH3:HPA/PHILES/CAPTURE           <- THIS IS THE PATH TO SAVE TO.

Of course the items including <- and after are not in the file, but
you understand that. Make sure that each line concludes with a 
carriage return, otherwise the scanner will read the two lines as
one entire line.

If this file is not pressent in the S: directory, the program will
prompt you to enter this information and ask you if you want to save
it to your S: directory.


NUARDIALER.CFG2:
----------------

This file is not really as important as CFG1, but still important for
quick automation. It contains on 5 lines the various characteristics
about the DNIC and area you are going to scan. Before I go further
into this configuration file, I will briefly explain the format of
most NUAS and how the NUA itself breaks down into seperate parts.
we will take one nua, 3110 202 00202.
                      \__/ \_/ \___/
					\   \    \__ NETWORK ADRESS
					 \   \______ AREA PREFIX
					  \_________ DNIC    	

The DNIC denotes what country, and more specificly, what network you
are reaching.

The AREA PREFIX denotes a specific area, or a specific segment of the
network acording to landmass or corporation both, or niether. Suffice
it to say, that it is a subgrouping of the DNIC.

The NETWORK ADRESS is node number that coresponds to one particular
computer connected to the network.

** QUICK NOTE: normally, to connect to a Telenet adress through telenet
   you would not need to enter the DNIC, but it does not matter if you
   do. This program always requires a DNIC so if you are going to scan
   telenet, use Telenet DNIC: 3110. 

To conclude, most all of the networks NUA configurations are differnt
it is up to you to discern where the area starts and ends, and where the
network adress continues. The DNIC is ALWAYS the first 4 digits of the
NUA.. if someone finds this to be different let me know, I would be 
very suprised. For Telenet and DataPac, the area is almost always a three
digit number, I am not sure about other NUAS area prefix length, but I can
be pretty sure that they are all the same size relative to the network
they are on.. for example if you were scanning Finland, with a DNIC
of 2442, AREA PREFIX was 02, and a NETWORK ADRESS of 223 the rest of the
area prefixs would be 2 digits long, and the network adresses would
be three digits long. The lengths are ususaly dependant on the relative
size of the network. 

Okay, now that that is over with, the firstline of the file 
NUARDIALER.CFG2 is the DNIC, whatever DNICS that are reachable through
Telenet are valid,

for example:
			 3110 TO SCAN TELENET ADRESSES
			 3020 TO SCAN DATAPAC ADRESSES
			 7305 TO SCAN VTRNET  ADRESSES

Those are just a few that are reachable through telenet. of course you can
still only connect to the ones that accept collect charges, but the
scanner will still record the ones that wont.

The second line of the file is the area to be scanned, this is the number
as stated above that denotes a certain area or subdevision of the network.
This number can start with a zero, but must always end with an interger.
For example: 203,025,974,332,02,234,723,802. You get the idea...
do not include zeros at the end of the area, that zero does not belong
to the area, but rather the adress. Remember, you always know that the
DNIC is the first four digits, deciding where the area starts and ends
and where the network adress starts is all that is left. This is very
easy when it comes to some NUAS, like Telenet or DataPac, but when you 
look at for example, some of the UK NUAS.. sometimes not one digit will
be zero. In this case, my best advice to those not experienced with
the networks, is just simply to compare NUAS of the same DNIC. You will
start to see similarities and from there you can make logical estimations.

The third line of this file is the total number of digits that folow
after the adress. The reason for this number is so that the maximum amount
of adresses can be scanned through.. I can not just assume that there
will always be a 3 digit area, 2 zeros, and then a 3 digit adress. 
As you've seen, differnt NUAS have different configurations. Just count
the number of digits that fall after the area, and that is the number 
here. For example, 302097500123 has a 5 digit area ___
                          \___/			     /
				         \_______________________/

The next line is simple, what area to start at. And the line after that
the fith and final line, is where to stop at. Neither of these numbers
require leading zeros, simply think of the area prefix as a number from
zero to 99999, and enter is accordingly.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE CONTENTS OF NUARDIALER.CFG2:
----------------------------------------------

3020           <- The DNIC
974            <- The AREA PREFIX
5              <- The length of the NETWORK ADRESS in digits
200            <- What adress to start at
1000           <- What adress to finish at.

** SOME NOTES ABOUT CFG2: If this is set up in your S: directory, the program
will automaticly dial telenet and start scanning when you run the arexx
program. You can run the program without the file in your S: directory,
the program will ask you for the information that would normally be loaded
from the file, save it to your S: directory, and then begin scanning.


THE CLOSING BITS:
-----------------

Well, that really about rapps it up. I hope everyone enjoys this simple to
use AREXX scanner, and I encourage others to start programing their own
AREXX utils. AREXX is really a fantastic language, and its an instant 
Amiga Basic beater... One last note about this program, it will create
a file for you in the directory you specify whos name is dependant on
what your scanning. For example, if your scanning 3020 207 000 - 050,
then it will create a file called 3020207.SCAN. This makes keeping track
of all your scans nice and simple.

If you have any bug reports send them to me on Hanger 18. If this file
is removed from its original publication, ask the "elite" they know the
number. And coincidently, as this is an arexx program and fully editiable
it gives you the owner chance to screw it up... ie re-program it. So go
ahead I suppose, but please give credit and respect to me when its due.

Also, this program is dedicated to Ronnie, who I have have been promising
a copy to for about a month.. sorry it took so long m8!!


THE GREETINGS BITS:
-------------------

Phresh Greetings go out to all corners of the lands, to all of the
PHATE all the Hanger &  DT crews, who know who they are, and I
want to extend a special greet to SCSI, who I believe, and I think 
I speak for most, to be one of the coolest guys in the scene.
SCSI man, yr the kind of person the scene needs more of!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

        BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- After 25 years of growth and
innovation, toll-free calling will soon face another change:
"portable" 800 numbers.

        Portability means that for the first time companies with
established 800 numbers will be able take their numbers with them
if they decide to change long distance companies.  And, any new
800 number application can obtain service from any company.

        Until the advent of portability, customers were unable to
change long distance companies without changing their 800 number.
As of March 1993, they will be able to keep their number and seek
out the long distance company offering them the best value in
terms of reliability, quality, features, service and cost.

        However, customers are not required to take any action in
connection with portability.  Their 800 service will remain with
their chosen long distance carrier unless they decide to change.

        Portability will give customers greater freedom of choice and
will allow AT&T reduced regulation.  AT&T expects this will speed
the introduction of new services to the marketplace.

        In a 1991 ruling, the Federal Communications Commission
ordered that portability begin by March 4, 1993, to increase
competition in 800 services.

        "In reality, the market is highly competitive today," said
Shaun Gilmore, marketing vice president for AT&T 800 Services.
"In fact, our studies show that 80 percent of all 800 numbers in
use today have come into existence since the advent of competition
in 1987.  And, because we have the best value, customers continue
to overwhelmingly choose us."

        Gilmore said that only half of the existing "vanity" numbers
are AT&T's and sees portability as an opportunity to attract
customers who now get 800 services from competing carriers.  He
went on to say that it's clear carriers were chosen, at times, for
the vanity number they had rather than for their superior value.
AT&T studies indicate that many of those customers can't wait to
switch to AT&T.

        "We believe that while 800 numbers are portable, the quality,
reliability and innovation of AT&T 800 Services are not," said
Gilmore.  "Customers who previously used other 800 services can
now change to AT&T."

        To make portability a reality, local and long distance
telephone companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
for the necessary changes and additions to their networks.
Although the work has begun, it will not be complete for several
years.

        While these changes are being made, some 800 calls may take a
few seconds longer to be connected.  When the work is finished,
however, most calls should go through more quickly than they do
today.  And, AT&T is committed to delivering the fastest call set-
up time in the industry.

        The new technology will also make it possible for telephone
companies to handle calls more efficiently.  In addition, it is
expected that portability will provide AT&T some regulatory relief
that will enable AT&T to offer new integrated services and even
more features tailored to the different needs of individual
telephone customers.

                     800 Number Portability:
                       AT&T's Perspective


Background:

        In 1967, AT&T launched toll-free calling as an innovative way
for large businesses to receive collect calls from their customers
and suppliers.  The service was viewed initially as a
technological convenience with limited appeal.  Since then,
new technology and marketing techniques have turned 800 Service
into a $7 billion industry.

        AT&T invented the technology for toll-free calling and the
network architecture to support it.  AT&T's system enabled local
telephone companies to handle 800-number calls quickly and easily
by having its switching equipment look at the first few digits a
customer dialed.  Identifying it as toll-free service, the call
was immediately routed to one of AT&T's network-based computer
databases for instructions on completing the call according to
specific customer directions.

        In the mid-eighties, other long-distance companies began to
enter the 800 market.  To accommodate their entry, Bellcore, as
the administrator of the North American Numbering Plan, assigned
to each company a discrete set of 800 numbers for their respective
customers.  By screening the first six digits dialed, the local
telephone company could pass the call to the appropriate long
distance company for completion.

        Although this network architecture afforded other long
distance companies access to the marketplace, it required a stable
number base to operate effectively.  An 800 customer could switch
from one long distance provider to another, but the customer would
have to accept a new 800 number from the set assigned to the new
long distance provider.  Because 800 numbers were sometimes
promoted widely, and because some numbers were chosen because they
could spell out an easily-remembered word or phrase (e.g., "800-
FIND ATT"), some customers wanted to be able to use an 800 number
assigned to them and have the freedom to choose the long distance
company that gave them the best service and value.

        On September 4, 1991, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) issued an order (FCC Docket 86-10) requiring the Regional
Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) and GTE to deploy the technology
necessary to allow 800 number portability.  The FCC directed the
industry to complete this structure by March 4, 1993, subject to
certain call set-up time delay standards.  This FCC mandate is
commonly referred to as "800 Number Portability" because the 800
number itself becomes portable from one long distance company to
another.


A Colossal Effort:

        The implementation of this new network architecture, although
full of technological promise, is rife with operational challenges
involving the integrity of 800 service.  This is not to suggest
that the task is so big that it can't be done; but it must be done
in a very precise manner to ensure that each and every customer's
calls will continue to be completed promptly and reliably.

        Hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent by the local
and long distance companies to implement the changes to the
network that are necessary to make portability a reality.  At the
heart of this new network, the local telephone companies are
installing equipment to support SS7.  The transition to SS7 may
take another two years due to some technical limitations within
the local telephone companies.  Until that happens, callers may
face increased delays in completing their 800 calls.  Many
customers are concerned because the delays will cause some callers
to abandon their calls before they are completed, and lost calls
translate into possible lost revenue.

        To reduce the customer's potential for any call connection
delays, AT&T has ordered state-of-the-art SS7 connections wherever
available.  Where these preeminent connections are made directly
to the local telephone company offices, callers may in fact
experience quicker connection times than today.

        The nationwide 800 network architecture is built on the local
telephone companies' new ability to determine which long distance
company is serving a particular 800 customer.  To accomplish this
task, the local telephone company must look at all ten digits
dialed and compare that number against a centralized database.  It
then sends the call to the appropriate long distance company, or,
it may follow pre-subscribed routing directions as originally
determined by the subscriber.  The work required to accomplish
this is considerably more complex than it might first appear.

        Communications networks are often described as high-tech,
silicon highways that carry calls like the nation's highway
network handles traffic.  Updating either infrastructure requires
a major overhaul.  And that's what's happening today with the
implementation of a common, nationwide signaling network (SS7) to
accommodate 800 number portability.

        Essentially, each of the long distance companies has to
connect its network to precise locations identified by the local
telephone companies.  These Signaling Points of Interface (SPOIs)
may be thought of as bridges needed to connect the local telephone
facilities to long distance telephone facilities.

        The industry must build these bridges, and all their
connecting roads, while traffic continues to flow over them.  One
mistake, or misconnection, and thousands of calls could go
uncompleted.  To the subscriber of the service this means lost
revenue opportunities.

        For AT&T's part, it has to move and connect more than 1.1
million lines to accomplish signaling connections to the local
telephone networks around the United States.  AT&T is tackling
this monumental task while connecting some 140 million telephone
calls each business day.  All while maintaining the the quality
and reliability of service and the call completion rates AT&T
customers have come to expect.


Administrative Hurdles:

        Just as there are technological feats to overcome, the
operational issues associated with establishing a new system in
the post-portability environment are equally challenging.  In the
past, the administrative functions of 800 service rested with
individual long distance companies.  Once a customer placed an
order, it was up to the carrier to assign a number and to provide
and maintain that service.

        The new post-portability environment calls for a centralized
database and operational support system called the Service
Management System (SMS).  SMS will enable all long distance
companies to reserve, activate, and deactivate 800 numbers.  This
database will contain the records for all 800 service customers
nationwide.  These records will then be shared with local
telephone companies' systems so they can switch calls to the
proper long distance company for completion.

NASC:

        The Number Administration and Service Center (NASC) will
provide the centralized administration for this 800 database
access approach.  It will perform two basic functions:

  o     the assignment of 800 numbers;

  o     and, the resolution of problems that may surface between the
        organizations representing 800 customers and the long
        distance companies.

        Currently, Bellcore is seeking an independent third party to
perform these functions under long-term contract.  Until a
suitable organization can be identified, Bellcore will act as the
administrator.


RESPORGs:

        The term "Responsible Organization," or "RESPORG" for short,
was adopted by the industry to identify a customer's primary point
of contact for a given 800 number.  The industry agreed that only
this designated entity will be authorized to make SMS changes for
a given customer's 800 application.  This basically means that it
is the RESPORG that will reserve 800 numbers, create and update
customer-specific records, and support maintenance activities such
as tracking and clearing troubles.

        The RESPORG clearly provides an important function.  To date,
there is no industry agreement as to which parties should be
permitted to perform the RESPORG function.  In many cases, it will
be the customer's long distance carrier.  However, since more than
one carrier may provide services to a customer, the RESPORG
responsibilities and duties must be clearly agreed upon.

        There is general consensus among the long distance companies
that customers should not perform this function themselves because
the carriers need to know of changes that may affect traffic
flows.  Without this knowledge, long distance carriers would face
difficulty in designing, sizing, and maintaining their networks.
Further, AT&T believes that the NASC also should be disqualified
from RESPORG consideration if it is to remain the neutral third
party that it is designed to be.

        To date, various scenarios surfaced, but none which have
garnered universal appeal.  It is AT&T's position that only
purchasers of access may perform RESPORG functions for interstate
800 services.  To allow anyone else to perform this function could
potentially interfere with the relationship between a long
distance company and its customer.  AT&T does however recognize
that the need may exist for a long distance company to authorize a
third party to perform these functions as an agent on their
behalf.  AT&T believes that this will accommodate those smaller
long distance companies that don't have the systems to perform
these functions themselves.

        The FCC is expected to rule on the RESPORG issue shortly.


Service Features:

        The transition to ten digit screening is the basic
technology that will enable the local telephone companies to
identify the long distance company providing service to any given
number.  This is known as carrier identification and is considered
a "basic feature" of the new environment.  But the technology can
provide additional functionality.  This additional feature set is
commonly referred to as "vertical features."

        Vertical features could include a variety of call routing
capabilities like geographic routing that would enable the
splitting of 800 traffic by carrier and region.  Or, it might
include time of day or time of week routing capabilities, or
percentage splits that route calls based on predetermined
percentages.  However, many of these same features are available
today directly through 800 number providers.  So, while many
telephone companies recognize the merit to the additional
availability of these features, the way to provide them remains in
dispute.

        AT&T's position is that basic service is the only cost that
should be borne by all subscribers to 800 service.  Vertical
features, while adding to the competitive mix of services, are
optional features that should be purchased separately and
therefore priced that way.  We do not believe that single line
customers, like AT&T Readyline(R) customers, should share the cost
for services more commonly used by large businesses.

        The FCC is expected to act on this issue later this year.


Portability's Opportunity:

        The most obvious and tangible benefit of portability will be
the customer's ability to switch long distance companies without
losing an established 800 number.  But AT&T sees portability as
the beginning of a new era.

        It will lead to less regulation, giving AT&T greater freedom
to offer even better value to customers.  It also means AT&T can
introduce new services more quickly.

        The customer's decision on which 800 carrier to use will
continue to be driven by who provides the best overall value --
defined as reliability, innovation, quality, service, and price.

        Who will deliver the most calls?  AT&T has the highest call
completion rate in the industry due to its networks' advanced
features like Real Time Network Routing (RTNR) and Fast Automatic
Restoration (FASTARsm).  Through this technology AT&T provides the
most reliable network in the industry completing virtually all
calls on the first attempt.  On average, our closest competitors
block more than twice as many calls.  And, our competitors are
twice as likely to have an outage on any given day even though
they carry fewer calls.

        And, there can be little argument as to who has the best
technology.  AT&T Bell Laboratories developed the Weber Patent, on
which the entire 800 database architecture is based.  Bell Labs is
a world renown research and development institution responsible
for much of the industry's innovation like real time network
management capabilities.

        Who provides the best service?  AT&T has the best Service
Assurance policy in the industry.  If anything ever disrupts AT&T
800 Service -- equipment failures, line problems, or localized
emergencies -- we offer a choice of back-up services to handle
customer calls and activate it within 30 minutes.

        Who delivers the best price performance for the money?  AT&T
has rates that are comparable to anything the competition can
offer.  When you consider that we deliver more calls, lead the
industry in innovation, and charge by the second only for what
customers use, you'll understand why we believe everyone will opt
for AT&T 800 Service given the opportunity.

10 Things You Always Wanted to Know About 'Portable' 800 Numbers
                     but Were Afraid to Ask


1.      Just what is portability?

  A.    800 number portability is an FCC-mandated change to the
        nation's telephone networks that will enable customers to
        change their 800 number service carrier without having to
        change their 800 numbers.  The FCC mandated portability to
        create a fully competitive market for 800 number services.

2.      What does having portability for my 800 numbers mean to me?

  A.    Portability means you will have the freedom to stay with or
        change to any interexchange 800 service provider, based on
        the features, prices, reliability and quality of service it
        offers, and still keep your same 800 number.

3.      Do I have to do anything once portability is available--such
        as select a new long distance provider for my 800 number
        service?

  A.    No, you do not have to do anything.  Portability is a
        convenience that will afford you greater freedom of choice
        for 800 number services.  It provides you the opportunity to
        carefully examine the value offered by each 800 number
        provider and, if you choose, change carriers at any time
        while keeping your same 800 number.

4.      Why can't I take my 800 number with me today if I switch 800
        service providers?

  A.    Until portability is available, the only way local telephone
        companies can tell which long distance carrier an 800 number
        customer is using is through a block of numbers assigned each
        carrier.  Therefore, if a customer leaves a particular
        carrier, that number must stay behind and a new number must
        be selected with the new carrier.

5.      What is changing that will allow me to keep my 800 numbers if
        I change long distance providers?

  A.    Each local telephone company is installing new equipment and
        software (already in use in AT&T's network) that will allow
        it to screen the full 10 digits of an 800 number to identify
        which long distance carrier the 800 customer is using and to
        route the call to that carrier's network.

6.      Does this mean that everybody will have the opportunity to
        chose from all available 800 numbers?

  A.    Yes, you'll be able to choose from any 800 number not
        currently in use.  It will be the responsibility of a
        centralized organization to keep track of what numbers are in
        use, available or being 'aged' before they can be put back
        into the system to be used again.

7.      But if everybody will now have access to all available 800
        numbers, how do I keep my old number or obtain a new number?

  A.    The same way as today.  You contact your service provider and
        initiate a request.  The service provider will either help
        you select a new 800 number or assure that your existing
        number has been correctly activated.

8.      Except for allowing me to bring my 800 number with me, it
        sounds like there's a whole lot of work going on for
        relatively little change for me as a customer.  Will I see
        any other improvements in 800 services?

  A.    Not immediately.  Local and long distance phone companies are
        now spending hundreds of millions of dollars to install
        databases, equipment and software; this is a process that
        will take several years to complete.  The new technology,
        however, will make it possible to handle calls more quickly
        and more efficiently.

9.      Is there any downside to 800 number portability?

  A.    While changes are still being made by the local telephone
        companies and the long distance carriers, some 800 calls may
        take a few seconds longer to connect.  When the work is
        finished, however, most calls should go through even more
        quickly than they do today.

10.     800 number portability sounds like it's going to be good for
        800 number customers.  But with all the related expense,
        what's going to happen to the cost of 800 service?

  A.    As in any fully competitive market, the cost for services
        will depend on three factors: the cost of providing the
        services and the extent to which the provider passes along
        these costs, the demand for the services and the number of
        companies capable of providing the services.  Therefore,
        though there will no doubt be some restructuring of 800
        number prices, any such changes will be controlled by the
        ultimate needs of 800 number customers.

                               ###


A Technical Challenge for the Nation's Telephone Companies

        Over the last 25 years, AT&T has pioneered the technologies
that have made nationwide 800 calling fast, convenient and
economical.  A key development was the combination of computerized
databases with a high-speed signaling system to direct each call
to its proper destination.

        With the advent of competition for 800 services, the local
telephone companies needed a way to tell which long distance
company handled which 800 calls.  So each long distance company
was assigned blocks of numbers.  Relatively simple equipment in
local switching offices could then switch each call to the right
carrier.

        The system required that each number remain assigned to one
carrier.  A customer who wanted to switch from one long distance
company to another had to use a new number.

        In 1991, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that
because of this limitation, the market for 800 services was not
fully competitive.  It ordered the implementation of a system that
would allow the portability of numbers by March 4, 1993.

        The FCC order created a major challenge for the entire
telecommunications industry.   More than 1.3 million 800 numbers
are now in use.  With portability, any one of them might be
handled by any of the competing long distance carriers, with
changes possible every day.

        The answer proved to be the database and signaling system
that AT&T and a few other companies were already using in their
own networks.  At the heart of this system is a method of quickly
translating the number dialed to specific switching instructions.

        The method was invented by AT&T and patented in 1978.  The
regional Bell operating companies received licenses to this patent
when the Bell System was broken up in 1982.  AT&T will grant
licenses, on reasonable terms, to other carriers who need the
technology to implement portability.

        Local and long distance telephone companies are now
installing databases and signaling systems and making related
changes and additions to their networks.  The project will cost
hundreds of millions of dollars.  Although the work has already
begun, it will not be fully completed for several years.

Network Changes for 800 Portability


        A massive technical effort is under way to make 800 number
portability a reality by March 4, 1993.

        The information required to set up most calls will be carried
over a high-speed data network called Common Channel Signaling
System 7, or SS7.  AT&T has been using this type of technology in
its long distance network since 1976, but it is relatively new to
many of the local telephone networks.

        Important elements of the new system are the Signal Transfer
Points (STPs).  Local telephone companies are installing this
equipment.  They will work with the existing STPs of AT&T and the
other long distance carriers to set up calls and transfer call
information.  Because STPs are crucial elements in the handling of
800 calls, they will work in pairs to assure reliability.

        The point where the links between local and long distance
company STPs are connected is called a Signaling Point of
Interface (SPOI).  There will be upwards of 160 AT&T-local company
STP interconnections established by March 4, 1993.

        AT&T is building four separate data links between each of its
12 pairs of STPs and each SPOI, and it is asking each local
company to do the same on its side of the SPOI.  In addition, AT&T
has requested at least three physically separate paths for the
data links through the SPOI itself.  Where this physical
triversity is not available, AT&T has asked for diversity routing.
The entire interconnection, with its four data links to each side,
is called a D-link Quad.

        All of these facilities require thorough, coordinated testing
from both sides to ensure that they will perform their signaling
and control functions properly.

        In order to be SS7 capable, local telephone end offices must
be linked to a local company STP.  Because the local companies
will not be able to provide direct SS7 links to all end offices,
they are reconfiguring their networks so that groups of end
offices can be connected through intermediate switching machines
called access tandems which will have SS7 capabilities.

        These changes in the local networks require matching changes
in AT&T connecting facilities that will carry the actual calls.
AT&T is adding nearly 80,000 trunks for this purpose.

        Existing trunks that carry calls between local companies and
long distance networks must also be converted to work with the new
signaling system.  AT&T has already converted more than 250,000 of
these trunks and will convert another 600,000 or more before 800
portability begins on March 4, 1993.

        To give some idea of the scope of this job, AT&T is now
converting well over 2,000 trunks every day and will soon boost
this to more than 4,000 per day.  Each conversion requires
coordinated switching software changes and testing with the local
telephone company to ensure the circuit is working properly.

                             # # #

800 Numbers: A Fixture of Life in America

        Since AT&T invented toll-free calling in 1967, 800 numbers
have become a fixture of life in America, and the idea has spread
to other countries around the world.  An estimated 11 billion 800
calls will be made this year alone.

        Of those U.S. businesses using 800 services, nearly two-
thirds of them rely on 800 numbers to take orders from customers,
to provide information and support for their products and to keep
in touch with employees in the field.  Governments and other
organizations use them to offer an array of services.  Americans
can call for help on subjects from AIDS and other health problems
to Social Security benefits and safe storage of meat and poultry
products.

        AT&T offers a vast and unsurpassed variety of 800 services.
They are tailored to the needs of businesses from the smallest to
the very largest.  There is even a new, low-cost 800 service for
families with college students or other members who are often away
from home.

Network Changes for 800 Number Portability are a Major Challenge


        The portability of 800 numbers requires a major change in the
way local telephone companies handle calls.

        Local telephone companies are installing new equipment for
routing 800 service calls in thousands of switching centers.  In
addition, local and long distance companies are adding or
modifying hundreds of thousands of connections between their local
and long distance networks.  AT&T alone is making more than
800,000 of these changes.

        All of this work must be completed and thoroughly tested
before 800 number portability begins on March 4, 1993.  And the
work must be done without interfering with the hundreds of
millions of calls that will continue to flow over the network
every day.

        The basis of this massive effort is a method of connecting
calls introduced by AT&T in its long distance network in 1976.
Called Common Channel Signaling (CCS), it uses computer controls
and dedicated, high-speed data channels to connect calls much more
quickly and efficiently.

        With the old method, a call was set up using the same
circuits customers used to converse.  As a result, call set-up
time was slower, and circuits that could have been used for
customers'  conversations were being used for call set-up -- an
inefficient use of capacity.

        The new method is more efficient.  In fractions of a second,
the CCS network collects information about the call, its
destination and conditions throughout the network.  It determines
the best available path for the call, then instructs the necessary
switches to set up the call -- using separate circuits from those
customers use.

        Local telephone companies will use SS7, the current version
of CCS, for 800 portability implementation.  The portability of
800 numbers means that large blocks of numbers will no longer be
permanently assigned to each long distance carrier.  Any one of
the almost 10 million possible 800 numbers might be assigned by
the customer to any of the long distance companies -- and
assignments can change at any time.

        In each local calling area, a large, centralized computer
database called a Service Control Point (SCP), regularly updated,
will contain the information the local telephone systems need.
The local office will use SS7 to send the number dialed to a
Signal Transfer Point (STP).  The STP passes this to the SCP,
which contains records on which long distance carrier is assigned
to handle the number.  The SCP will then pass the call information
over the assigned carrier's SS7 link and instruct the local switch
to connect the call to the carrier's network.

        The local telephone companies are installing SCPs, STPs, as
well as thousands of SS7 channels to connect them to each other,
to local switches and to long distance carriers.  To ensure that
calls get through reliably, STPs are set up in matching pairs, and
each connection between AT&T and the local companies will have
multiple alternate paths.

        In addition to the introduction of SS7 signaling facilities
in the local networks, extensive additions and modifications are
needed to the circuits that actually carry the calls.  Hundreds of
thousands of circuits connecting the local and long distance
networks must be modified to work with SS7.  Each modified circuit
must be carefully tested from both ends to ensure it is working
properly.

        Local telephone companies will not be able to provide access
to the SCPs for all of their local switching centers before 800
number portability begins.  Local switches without this capability
must therefore pass 800 calls to an intermediate switching center
called an access tandem that does have access to the SCPs.  AT&T
is adding nearly 80,000 new circuits to connect calls to be
rerouted through these access tandems.

        Much of this work must be done during the end-of-the-year
holiday season when 800 service calling is at its heaviest.  The
effort can be compared to rebuilding a bridge with new supports,
ramps and express lanes without ever interrupting the constant
flow of cars and trucks across the span.

Customers Concerned That 800 Number Portability
Could Cause Call Delays


        Many customers who welcome the coming of 800 number
portability have expressed concern that it may have some short-
term unwelcome effects.

        The changes necessary to make 800 number portability a
reality will increase the time it takes some 800 number calls to
go through. Delays could be long enough that some callers may give
up on their calls before they are completed.

        For businesses that rely on 800 numbers for contacts with
their customers, lost calls mean lost opportunities and,
potentially, lost revenues.

        Preparations for portability are well underway.  This work
will introduce some increases in call set up time before
portability begins next March. The transition period spans the
end-of-year holiday season, a particularly important time for many
businesses.

        The time from the moment the caller dials the last digit of
the number to the moment the called telephone begins to ring is
called post-dial delay.  It is a measure of the speed with which
the local and long distance companies involved can process the
call and set up a connection to its destination.

        To provide portability, the local telephone company must
access a database to find out which long distance carrier is
currently handling calls to the 800 number dialed.  This process
can add to post-dial delay.

        However, the signaling system used to access the database can
also relay the call data to the signaling systems used by AT&T and
other long distance carriers to route calls through their
networks.  The speed of the signaling system can mitigate post-
dial delay.  If the local company's switching office where the
call originates is part of the signaling system, and the circuits
between the local company switch and the long distance company
switch have been made compatible with the signaling system,
overall post-dial delay times can be reduced.

        Installing the new signaling systems throughout their
networks is a large and costly job for both long distance and
local telephone companies.  Unfortunately, network interconnect
will not be completed in all serving areas before the March 4,
1993, date set by the Federal Communications Commission for the
start of portability.  So the local companies are using a variety
of interim switching arrangements to meet the deadline.

        These arrangements will add more time to post-dial delays for
many calls.  In some cases, total delay may run more than ten
seconds.

        Both AT&T and the FCC have responded to concerns over post-
dial delay.  The FCC has ruled that the major local telephone
companies must keep their portion of call set-up time from 5.5 to
6.5 seconds for all, or nearly all, of the 800 number calls they
handle when portability begins.  The FCC has also said that it
expects the average delay to be "at least as good as it is today"
within two years.  That means the average delay should be no more
than 2.5 seconds.

        AT&T is working with the local companies to schedule work
that needs to be done and to minimize delays.  AT&T and several
800 customer groups have also asked the local companies not to
start up their database operations during the final months of this
year.  Such premature start-up could cause significant increases
in post-dial delay at a time when incoming calls are particularly
important for many 800 number customers.

AT&T CHOOSES ANTEL TO SUPPLY PRIVACY-CAPABLE CELLULAR PHONES


GREENSBORO, N.C. (December 17, 1992) -- AT&T has selected Antel
Communications Corp. to supply new cellular telephones that
function with AT&T's recently announced Cellular Privacy System.

Antel, based in Hauppauge, N.Y., will supply a line of cellular
telephones specially adapted for use with AT&T's cellular privacy
technology.  Antel is a major manufacturer and distributor of
cellular telephones in the United States and around the world.

"AT&T and Antel make the ideal team to produce our first privacy-
capable cellular telephone -- the AT&T Model 9000," said Ed Hickey,
AT&T Vice President, Secure Communications Systems.

The AT&T Model 9000 Privacy-Capable Cellular Phone will be
manufactured to AT&T's specifications by Antel.  It will be
available in February.

Antel President Louis Antoniou said the agreement with AT&T
represents a unique opportunity for Antel to combine its expertise
in technology sourcing, marketing and distribution with AT&T's
cellular privacy technology."

The AT&T Cellular Privacy System protects calls by scrambling the
cellular telephone's over-the-air signal.  The signal is
descrambled at the cellular carrier's switch, transmitting a
conventional phone signal to the recipient.

The AT&T Model 9000 Privacy-Capable Cellular Telephone, an 8.9-
ounce portable model, is a full-featured third-generation phone.
In addition to its sleek styling and easy operation, the Model 9000
offers a 100-number alphanumeric memory and multiple phone number
(NAM) operation.

The optional privacy unit and its extended battery add less than
six ounces to the weight of the phone.  The module and battery add
about a half inch to the depth of the phone.

Suggested retail price of the Model 9000 is $795.  The optional
privacy unit retails for $895.

The AT&T Model 9000 will be backed by extensive customer support
and a nationwide network of service centers.  The phone comes with
a two-year warranty.

The AT&T Cellular Privacy System was developed by AT&T Secure
Communications Systems, a world leader in the design, manufacture
and integration of encryption and privacy products.  It is a
leading supplier of secure products to the governments of the
United States and other nations as well as corporations around the
world.

 February 11, 1993.

 Februay brought us the birth of a new magazine entitled WIRED. With 
 contributions from such noted writers as John Perry Barlow, (as well a
 co founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), John Markoff, well
 known net writer and co-author of two books, and Bruce Sterling, co-founder
 if you will, with William Gibson, of the Cyberpunk movement in literature.
 Sterling is the author of several cyberpunk novels including "Islands in the
 Net","Schismatrix" and The Difference Engine (with William Gibson). He also
 recently published a non-fiction work The Hacker Crackdown, "Law and 
 disorder on the Electronic Frontier", which concerns the implications of
 many famous hacking busts and their aftereffects on both law enforcement
 the public, and the media. 

 The rest of the magazine is written by a number of highly intelligent
 writers who all seem to write in the same frame of mind. That is, "What
 you are giving us is not good enough! Dont try and sell us your outdated
 technologies and tell us they are the future, we've seen the future and
 you arent selling it!" 
 
 The magazine claims NOT to be a technology magazine. I agree completely
 with their claims. A technology magazine features articles by people
 named Ned who wake up every sunday, go to church, go to work 5 days a
 week from 9 to 5, flirt with the receptionist, come home watch the 
 evening news and read the newspaper (maybe) and then go to bed. A 
 technology magazine hems and haws over the latest features in this or
 that new wonder product... It is a selling device for products, a good
 review means a boost in sales. Technology magazines are allways in a
 a false sense of saftey concerning the current stage of technology...
 being "Its GREAT, and it can only get BETTER"...
 
 WIRED, seeks to destroy this myth by offering positive methods, plans
 and possibilites for the future of microelectronics, literature, 
 communications, and subculture. Wired is your bible to what is happening
 now, and what will happen in these areas of interest. Touting Marshall
 McLuhan (Authour of The Medium is The Message, and other works..) as
 their "patron saint", it is clear to see where Wired stand. The message
 is future technology, communication, and subculture. The medium is a 
 high gloss full colour artisticly rendered magazine of 112 pages that
 offers the most amount of interesting and usefull information I've ever
 seen published and put on a newstand.

 Some of the articles/authors that are featured in the premier
 issue include:
 
 "War is Virtual Hell"
    - by Bruce Sterling

 "Scream Of Conciousness"
    - Camille Paglia, Interviewed by Stewart Brand

 Note: Camille Paglia is one of the most 
 intelligent writers of recent years, her book
 "Sexual Personae" is a literary masterpiece,
 and has been recently joined by the companion
 second volume of this work.

 "Cellular Phreaks and Code Dudes"
    - by John Markoff

 An excelent, non-gloss, non-fluff, look at the recent trend of 
 cellular fone modification.

 and one of my favourite articles:

 "The Incredibly Strange Mutant Creatures 
  Who Rule the Universe of Alienated Japanese
  Zombie Computer Nerds"

 an excelent article about the Japanse Otaku subculture that basses itself
 on information trading through fax and bulletin boards. Words arent 
 enough, its an excelent article, check it out.


 As I stated before, this magazine features some excellent writers who 
 are as immersed in this world of accelerated culture and technology as
 those who read the magazine are. There is no sensationalism and no
 hype. I couldnt give this magazine any higher praise, check it out at
 a magazine stand near you!
