OBS: Para quem nao esta' acostumado com arquivos de extensao .gz:
Na hora de fazer o ftp, digite binary + enter, depois digite
o nome do arquivo sem a  extensao .gz
Existe um descompactador no ftp.unicamp.br, oak.oakland.edu ou em 
qualquer mirror da Simtel, no subdiretorio:

/SimTel/msdos/compress/gzip124.zip to expand it before you can use it.
Uma vez descompactado o arquivo GZIP.EXE, a sintaxe seria:
                           "A>gzip -d arquivo.gz

No  caso,  voce  teria que trazer os  arquivos  be.??.gz  para  o 
ambiente DOS com o nome alterado para algo parecido com  be??.gz, 
para isso funcionar.

                                INTRODUCAO:
                                ===========

Bom,  gente.  Demorou,  mas saiu. Ta' cada vez mais irregular  a  saida  do 
Barata Eletrica. Mas tem que ser ou assim ou parar. Parar ta' meio dificil. 
Quem  vai  fazer a cabeca da mocada? A maioria dos  jornalistas  nao  manja 
nada  do que esta' acontecendo na Internet, nao manja os topicos, para  nao 
falar  de Hacker Underground. Que e' uma forca positiva na rede, apesar  do 
que algumas vezes a imprensa (norte-americana) diz. Basta ver que a Usenet, 
foi obra nao de uma IBM ou Microsoft da vida, mas subproduto do programador 
que  fez  o sistema operacional Unix, um sistema aberto e possivel  de  ser 
implementado em qualquer tipo de computador usando qualquer chip. Um  tempo 
depois,  quando  a  Internet ainda era do  Departamento  de  Defesa  (DoD), 
estudantes  descontentes  com o fato de que sua Universidade nao  tinha  os 
contatos  (Quem  Indica)  nem  a grana para  participar  da  ARPANET,  eles 
arregacaram  as mangas e fizeram a hoje conhecida como USENET.  Ninguem  se 
lembra  que  foram  individuos isolados e nao  grandes  multinacionais  que 
colocaram  os  computadores  ao  alcance do  publico.  Mas  isso  e'  outra 
historia.
     Para quem nao sabe, minha conta rodrigde@usp.br nao esta'  disponivel. 
Pintou uma historia bem cabeluda e pra simplificar, um arquivo, contendo  o 
texto  "Hacker Crackdown" do Bruce Sterling foi confundido com  o  software 
"crack".  Eu  tinha abreviado o nome do livro e compactado.  Alguem  viu  o 
arquivo  crack.gz  e .. congelou minha conta. Isso foi o que  me  contaram. 
Primeiro  me mandaram convidar a pessoa que assinou embaixo p.  testemunhar 
na  hora  de  provar se o arquivo era ou nao  perigoso  p.  integridade  do 
sistema.  Depois me falaram que bastava um documento explicando  a  "raison 
d'etre"  do arquivo e assinatura do meu superior. Agora estou  esperando  a 
pessoa  que coordena o CCE, a sra. Prof. Dra. M?????? J???????? C?????  ler 
meu  oficio  (data: 7/02/96) e reativar minha conta.  Se  reativar.  Quando 
penso no trabalho que tenho p. conservar o meu zine inofensivo, no tanto de 
fas  que  tenho, entrevista p. jornal, (pra quem nao sabe, saiu  um  artigo 
sobre hackers no Jornal da Tarde 27/02/96 e no Diario de Pernambuco, com  a 
minha foto, inclusive)  atraso no meu final de curso,  cartas   expressando
admiracao de  Web-masters  de  varios lugares do Brasil, editores de  zines 
dando a maior forca, fica claro o porque de escrever artigo sobre censura n 
rede.  Mas  tudo  bem.  Vou esperar com paciencia. A  pessoa  que  tomou  a 
iniciativa de congelar minha conta deve ter razao para os grilos dela e  os 
grilos so' cantam na cabeca do dono.  
     Claro  que isso me atrapalhou um pouco. To descansando muito  mais  no 
meu  emprego, por conta desse atraso e me curando do habito de  ficar  duas 
horas por dia so' gerenciando as listas que gerenciava. A mulher que me deu 
a noticia do porque travaram minha conta quase morreu de rir quando  falei: 
"vai  ver  que e' pro meu proprio bem". Chato vai ficar pro  Izar,  a  quem 
prometi publicar uma carta sobre o break-in na Unicamp. Esqueci de falar um
lance: e' que a historia toda comecou quando suspeitei de que alguem  havia
entrado na minha conta, alguem ou que roubou minha senha ou tinha super-usr
power.. e fez porcaria p. eu saber que alguem havia estado la'. Foi  depois
disso e' que foram examinar o que tinha acontecido na minha conta e nao sei
viram o arquivo de nome crack.gz. Ai, congelaram, explicaram porque, entre-
guei o oficio com minha versao e espero que tudo isso acabe logo.
     Enquanto  isso,  qual nao e' minha satisfacao em ver  que  o  universo 
literario  na rede esta' aumentando e mais zines estao  surgindo  incluindo 
outro hacker zine muito bom, o hack.br. Leiam a lista na secao de dicas.
     Por  ultimo,  um  recado  a todos  aqueles  que  me  escrevem  pedindo 
orientacao para ser hackers eles mesmos: leiam o Barata Eletrica e  trilhem 
seu proprio caminho. NAO ME ESCREVAM PEDINDO REFERENCIA SOBRE O SATAN  e/ou 
QUALQUER  SOFTWARE  DE  QUEBRAR SENHAS. NAO SEJAM  PENTELHOS.  Minha  conta 
esta'  sendo  monitorada.  Isso significa que o  pessoal  provavelmente  le 
minhas  cartas e avisa pro Sysop do lugar onde o individuo tem a conta  que 
fulano  tem  interesse em fazer tal coisa. Eu nao envio dicas,  truques  ou 
explicacoes  sobre vandalismo eletronico. Ponto final.
     Pode ser que haja gente que faca isso. Sei la. Quem quiser, que espere 
ate' eu marcar o proximo encontro de hackers, apareca la' e torca p.  algum 
cara que venha atenda seu pedido. Ou peca p. lista hackers. Nao me queima o 
filme com meu Sysop. Queime voce com o seu, se quiser.

                    TENDINITE: VOCE AINDA VAI TER UMA..
                    ===================================

     A  coisa comeca de uma forma meio sutil. Primeiro e' uma  pontada,  um 
pequeno  incomodo  no cotovelo ou nas maos, depois de um dia  de  trabalho. 
Coisa  facil de ignorar, vai ver que e' uma frescura ou  distensao  daquele 
objeto  pesado que ajudou a carregar, semana passada. Amanha ou depois,  se 
nao passar, vai no medico, que tambem pode acabar receitando um  analgesico 
e  .. ta' limpo, pronto pra outra. Durante meses, volta e meia, pinta  esse 
incomodo nas maos, mas tem tanto trabalho p. fazer que nem e' bom parar pra 
pensar. Nunca da' tempo. Ate' que a dor aumenta um pouquinho. Agora ta' nas 
omoplatas. Tudo bem, to fumando muito, deve ser o pulmao. Ou entao e' falta 
de  exercicio, precisa de ferias, fazer esporte. O preco de ficar velho.  A 
gente trabalha duro, o corpo ta' reclamando, so' isso. Ai', um dia,  aquele 
dia,  tchan-tchan-tchan. Voce sente um choque eletrico ao bater uma  tecla. 
Tenta  de novo: Aiiiiiiiii!!! Teus amigos te perguntam o que foi?  Ta'  com 
frescura?  Quer  folgar  mais cedo, e'... tem servico p.  fazer,  meu,  ta' 
pensando o que? E, finalmente, alguem, com quem voce nem falava, que  volta 
e meia era chamado de "preguicoso profissional", "o cara do atestado",  vem 
falar  contigo, pergunta umas coisas, te chama de lado e fala pra  voce  ir 
ver   fulano.  Fulano  e'  um  ortopedista  que   diagnostica:   TENDINITE! 
TENOCINOVITE! SINDROME DE TUNEL CARPAL! Voce nunca mais esquece esse  dia.. 
o  primeiro  dia  do  resto  de  sua  vida  convivendo  com  o  perigo   da 
aposentadoria  precoce  por invalidez. 
     Algumas  pessoas tem mais sorte, se preocupam mais cedo com  o  lance. 
Outras,  chegam  a sofrer dores atrozes tentando abrir um vidro  de  Xampu. 
Aquilo  que  alguns chamam de vida sexual, acaba. No caso  da  sindrome  de 
Tunel  Carpal,  todos os objetos sao pesados demais para segurar  ou  duros 
demais  para apertar. Este tipo de lesao e' simples: o nervo e' lesado  por 
excesso  de esforco repetitivo. Nao ter vida sedentaria, fazer  musculacao, 
ajuda como prevencao. Assim como uma coisa que cursinho de computacao nunca 
ensina, uma postura correta no teclado. 10 minutos de descanso, apos 50  de 
trabalho no micro. Evitar jornadas de mais de cinco horas de trabalho.  Dar 
umas  voltas  de  vez  em quando. Arrumar uma boa  cadeira  pra  sentar,  e 
observar  uma boa postura. Usar teclado ergonomico, ter um angulo de 45  no 
cotovelo (que deve estar colado ao corpo) para digitar. Etc, etc
     So' gente que ja' passou pelo problema, pode realmente dar as melhores 
dicas. A coisa nao e' privativa dos digitadores. Tudo depende da tensao com 
que o sujeito bate no teclado (suave ou como um martelo), e da ansiedade no 
trabalhar  com  a maquina. Professores tem tendinite nos ombros,  de  tanto 
executar  o  movimento de limpar o quadro negro. Empregadas  tem  isso,  de 
tanto  passar roupa. Bancarios tambem, de tanto digitar numeros. Quando  os 
primeiros computadores chegaram no Brasil, isso ficou conhecido como doenca 
de  digitador. Algumas firmas davam o curso de digitacao para a  pessoa  .. 
quando  ela estava sentindo dores nas maos, ia p. medico da empresa,  pedia 
transferencia,  era posta na rua. Deu um bafafa', ate' que o Ministerio  do 
Trabalho  tomou algumas providencias sobre o lance. Mas ate' na  construcao 
civil esse tipo de coisa acontece.

                 Algumas doencas relacionadas ao trabalho:

    * Lesoes  por esforco repetitivo: tenossinovite, tendinite, miosite 
    (inflamacao    de   tendoes,   nervos   e   musculos),    bursite, 
    cervicobraquialgia, artrose
    * Sindrome do tunel do Carpo: doenca que acomete a regiao do punho 
    e  atinge o nervo mediano. Tambem tem entre suas  vitimas  pessoas 
    que executam movimentos repetitivos.
    *  Sindrome  de Quervain: doenca que compromete  o  movimento  dos 
    tendoes do polegar. Mais uma vez, os movimentos repetitivos sao  a 
    causa do problema.
    *  Artrose, escoliose, lombagia: inflamacoes das  articulacoes  da 
    coluna  vertebral, que afetam pessoas que passam muito tempo  numa 
    mesma posicao, em geral inadequada.
    *  Irritacao  nos olhos: atingem pessoas que  ficam  muitas  horas 
    diante  do  video  ou que praticam atividades  que  exijam  grande 
    acuidade visual, em geral sob iluminacao incorreta
    *  Problemas  auditivos  e  emocionais:  afeta  quem  trabalha  em 
    ambiente com excesso de ruido, geralmente acima de 60 decibeis, ou 
    em atividades estressantes e que exijam muita concentracao.
    (materia do Estado de Sao Paulo - 19/09/993 - A30)

O chato da coisa e' que o diagnostico da(s) doenca(s) ligadas a  movimentos 
repetitivos  depende  da pessoa. No caso de um fucador de  micro,  qualquer 
formigamento que aparecer no punho, braco ou ombro, nao tem alternativa, e' 
melhor  ir  imediatamente ao ortopedista. Amanha pode ser tarde  demais.  O 
normal   e'  a  pessoa  ir  ignorando  o  incomodo,  ate'  que  ele   fique 
insuportavel.  So' que, ai', as chances de sarar a coisa por completo,  sao 
menores.  Crianca  e adolescente que ficam brincando  de  videogame  direto 
tambem pega este tipo de doenca.

Alguns exemplos:

     Fui  acompanhar um amigo meu la' na triagem do H.U. para este tipo  de 
coisa.  De seis pessoas, quatro eram tenocinovite. Um era sambista  amador, 
que tinha profissionalizado um mes antes da dor ficar insuportavel. 8 horas 
por  dia  durante alguns anos, num boteco. Ficava direto  no  batuque,  sem 
pedir  descanso. Achava um barato. Legal mesmo deve ter sido a  injecao  de 
antibiotico  no nervo inflamado. As vezes, o nervo machucado  infecciona  e 
so'  melhora com injecao do medicamento no proprio local. Ele disse  que  o 
medico  foi "tateando" com a agulha ate' achar a infeccao. Chegou a  chorar 
de dor. O braco de alguem com tendinite em estagio avancado fica inflamado, 
duro  em varias partes. Carregar uma sacola de supermercado fica dificil  e 
ate' deixar o braco solto, "e' como carregar dois pesos de chumbo".  Dormir 
em  cima do mesmo, impossivel. E'licenca medica de seis meses a um  ano  na 
certa.  Isso  se a pessoa conseguir dirigir o carro ate'  o  trabalho,  por 
exemplo:  as  maos  nao tem forca p fazer curvas fechadas  com  o  volante. 
Castigo?  A  mulher que me contou sua experiencia disse que achava  que  as 
licencas medicas de uma amiga eram um "truque", uma frescura para faltar ao 
trabalho. Ai, por um problema no orcamento, tempos depois, cortaram  metade 
do pessoal, mas a quantidade de trabalho continuou a mesma. O resultado foi 
esse.  O meu amigo net-surfava direto. Ta fazendo fisioterapia, agora.  Mas 
fez a coisa certa: foi atras enquanto o lance era so' "frescura".

E o fucador de micro?

     Como  isso  afeta  o fucador de micro? Conheco um  cara  que  continua 
fucando, normalmente. Ele trata, melhora e volta. Me disse que malhando,  a 
coisa  diminuiu  um pouco. A maioria dos atingidos da um  jeito  de  tentar 
continuar trabalhando, mesmo com isso. Enfaixam os bracos e mandam ver.  Ou 
isso  ou  passar  fome.  "A falta de grana e' a raiz  de  todos  os  males" 
(Tolkien).  Mas quando a doenca era coisa nova no Brasil, aconteciam  casos 
em que os digitadores eram contratados, desenvolviam a doenca e eram postos 
na   rua,   inutilizados   para  o  trabalho.    Hoje   existem   portarias 
regulamentando a coisa. Pra digitador e' mais facil conversar com o chefe a 
respeito.  Acontece  muito. A pessoa aprende a digitar, mas  nao  apende  a 
posicao correta das maos e do corpo. Os programadores tem um pouco mais  de 
sorte, porque e' um trabalho mais intelectual, pode ficar mais tempo  longe 
do teclado. Mas existem casos de verdadeiros "monstros sagrados" de Analise 
de Sistemas que tiveram que contratar gente p. digitar por eles.

Alguma esperanca?

     Existe,  nos  EUA,  um  sistema chamado  "Dragon",  o  maior  programa 
residente  do mundo, como e' conhecido. Na configuracao minima, 386  DX  40 
megahertz, 16 mega de memoria, ele toma 8 mega de RAM so' pra ele. A pessoa 
pode ditar as palavras e ele escreve. Sei la' o preco.  E'  uma  esperanca, 
pra quem sofre do mal e nao e' gago. E tem acesso ao programa. Mas isso  e' 
noticia velha, deve haver sistemas mais novos e com certeza em alguns anos, 
estarao  disponiveis  programas "shareware" para isso. Quantos  tempo  para 
isso acontecer e' algo a se pensar ... O trecho abaixo foi tirado de um FAQ 
de  um  desses  produtos. Para nao dizerem que  estou  fazendo  propaganda, 
abaixo  tem um trecho mencionando outros produtos.

   
  WHAT IS DRAGONDICTATE?     Simon.Crosby@cl.cam.ac.uk 
(tirado do http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/a2x-voice/ (this should include
               information on the new a3x software which works with Windows NT
               instead of Unix and X)
               ftp://ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/a2x-voice/ )
   
   DragonDictate is a speech recognition system which runs on a PC. It is
   a discrete utterance system, which means that you have to pause
   between words. It runs under DOS or windows. DragonDictate has a large
   English vocabulary, and also allows the definition of macros, which
   are basically sounds with which are associated sets of keystrokes. For
   example, controlling your editor you might need a macro "open file",
   which presses the magic key sequence to load a file into your editor.
   Although DragonDictate is PC based, it is possible to direct its
   output to a sensible machine, such as a workstation, by putting an
   Ethernet or serial interface onto the PC, and using a telnet program
   to send the keystrokes from DragonDictate to the workstation. A piece
   of public domain software called a2x allows you to convert ASCII
   keystrokes into events on a X display, so it is possible to "talk to
   X". 
   
  OTHER SPEECH RECOGNITION PRODUCTS 

From: "Carlos M. Puig" 
Date: Wed, 30 Nov 1994 20:46:01 -0800

     The current issue of PC Magazine (December 20, 1994) has a major
review section on voice recognition products (pages 203-219).  The
following products are covered in detail:
 
     o Dragon Dictate for Windows
     o IBM Personal Dictation System
     o IBM Continous Speech Series
     o Kurzweil Voice for Windows
     o Listen for Windows
     o Phonetic Engine 500 Speech Recognition
 
In addition, there is a table of "Other Voice-Recognition Products" (p.
209) and a sidebar on "Navigation in a Mouseless World" (pp. 212-13)
covering briefly:
 
     o Voice Assist (bundled with the Sound Blaster 16)
     o VoiceMouse
     o IBM Navigation Product (name not finalized)
     o QuickSwitch for OS/2
 
This time there is no editor's choice:
 
"While voice-recognition technology for the PC has finally advanced enough
to yield productive tools, we feel that it's still too early in the game to
pick a clear winner in any of the the three categories we examined
[dictation, navigators, and application development]."


TENDINITE, DOENCA PROVOCADA PELA MESMICE

{Trechos - Jornal da USP - 5 a 11/12/1994 - pg 9}

Os resultados da inflamacao  sao sentidos pelos pacientes de tendinite- que 
sequer conseguem fechar as maos e geralmente ignorados pelos medicos  menos 
experientes.  Como nao deixa marcas a vista e nao  e detectada  por  exames 
laboratoriais  tradicionais, a doenca e diagnosticada como pretexto para  o 
paciente  ficar  alguns dias sem trabalhar. Nada mais  enganoso,  porem.  A 
tendinite so pode ser diagnosticada  por  exames clinicos, em que o  medico 
descobre a doenca atraves dos sintomas apresentados pelo paciente.
Quando  finalmente  convence  o medico e chefe  de  que   realmente   esta' 
doente,   o paciente se encontra em dos quatro graus da tendinite, como  os 
fisioterapeltas classificam os estagios de gravidade da doenca. No primeiro 
deles,  pessoa  sente  dores nas maos apenas no periodo do dia.  Se  a  dor 
persistir a noite a noite, incomodando o sono, paciente ja avancou um  grau 
na  doenca. O terceiro grau da doenca se craracteriza por  dificuldades  em 
mover a mao e aumento no volume dos tendoes, causado pela inflamacao. Todas 
estas  dficuldades  acentuadas  e somadas  a  total  incapaciade  funcional 
colacam o paciente no quarto grau da tendinite.
Ha  outros  formas  de se contrair  a doenca. Para  isso,  basta  a  pessoa 
realizar o mesmo movimento constantemente, no trabalho ou em casa. O habito 
de  fazer  croche, por exemplo, e apontado pelos  fisioterapeutas  como  um 
fator  de  risco.  O dentista, pela obrigacao  profissional  de  movimentar 
constantemente  os  punhos e as maos, tambem pode apresentar  problemas.  A 
tendinite  nao e um inevitavel produto da industrializacao. Ela   pode  ser 
evitada. "E muito importante que as empresas se conscientizem desse  perigo 
desse  perigo e tomem medidas que previnam o aparecimneto da tendinite  nos 
seus  funcionarios",  alerta a fisioterapeuta Raquel  Aparecida  Casarotto, 
professora  do  curso  de Fisioterapia da faculdade  de  Medicina  da  USP. 
Segundo ela, ha varias acoes que, se particadas, quase eliminam o risco  de 
contrair tendinite.
Para digitadores  - categoria profissional mais acomedida pela tendinite -, 
Raquel  recomenda  primeiro que o mobiliario seja adequado ao  trabalho:  o 
teclado  do microcomputador deve estar exatamente a 90 graus em  relacao  a 
pessoa  e  numa altura em que nao seja necessario abaixar  ou  levantar  os 
ombros  e cotovelos. A tela deve estar ajustada de forma que a  nao  exigir 
que o digitador movimente a  cabeca para enxergar oque escreve. Os periodos 
de descanco tambem sao necessarios as pessoas que trabalham varias horas  a 
frente  de  um computador. Citando estudos feitos no  exterior  e  adotados 
internacionalmente, Raquel afirma que o digitador deve reservar dez minutos 
de  descanso  para  cada hora de trabalho. Alem disso o  ideal  e  que  nao 
ultrapasse o limite de oito mil toque por hora de servico.
A  recuperacao  total de um paciente pode levar ate um ano  de  tratamento, 
dependendo do grau de gravidade da doenca. No Centro de Doenca Ocupacionais  
a   media  de  recuperacao  dos  pacientes  e' de  cinco  meses   -   tempo 
suficientemente longo e caro para uma empresa ficar sem seu funcionario.
(Roberto G. Castro)
     Uma  boa de se prevenir, e' aprender a digitar com a postura  igual  a 
ilustracao abaixo, que esta' em formato uuencodado. Ver apendice no final.

DESGASTE VISUAL:

De  acordo com um estudo realizado em 1990, pelo National Research  Council 
e  a  National  Academy  of Science, 50 %  dos  usuarios  profissionais  de 
terminais de video (vulgo monitores de computador) apresentavam sintomas de 
desgaste  ocular,  sendo  pelo  menos um  deles  o  desconforto  visual.  A 
percentagem  de  usuarios profissionais trabalhando  em  condicoes  ideais: 
entre  5 e 10%. Para diminuir esse desgaste, alem de  periodicamente  fazer 
intervalos para descansar os olhos, a luz no local de trabalho deve ser  no 
maximo,  tres  vezes mais brilhante do que o fundo da  tela.  A  iluminacao 
fluorescente da maioria dos escritorios e' mais intensa do que isso(*).  Se 
possivel  desligue a luz que incide diretamente sobre a tela. Se  voce  usa 
constantemente   algum  texto  impresso,  utilize  uma  pequena   luminaria 
incidindo  sobre o texto. O uso de telas anti-reflexivas elimina  reflexos, 
diminui  o  brilho do monitor e absorve luz ambiente, evitando  que  atinja 
nossos olhos. 

  Sinais diretos do desgaste   Sinais indiretos do desgaste ocular(*)

- Cansaco Visual             - Dor ou tensao muscular nos ombros e pescoco
- Visao turval               - Dor nas costas
- Olhos irritados            - Fadiga excessiva durante uso de monitores
- Visao dupla                - Irritacao excessiva durante o uso de monitor
- Alteracao na percep. cores - Dimininuicao da eficiencia visual e maior

                   A QUESTAO DA CENSURA NA REDE INTERNET 
                   =====================================

A maioria dos leitores regulares do Barata Eletrica  ja' deve ter sentido a 
barra  pesada  que  foi, nos EUA, a questao do  Computer  Underground  e  a 
implantacao  da  Internet. A democratizacao da informacao,  permitida  pela 
Internet  criou um sem-numero de discussoes e obrigou a revisao/criacao  de 
varias  leis  e  mecanismos para tentar controlar aquilo  que  e'  uma  das 
melhores formas de se batalhar pela unificacao da raca humana.
     Mais especificamente, estou falando da "The Communications Decency Act 
of  1995" (Ato de Decencia nas Comunicacoes) do sen. James Exon.  A  emenda 
expandiria  os  regulamentos  atuais   referentes  a  trotes  ou   chamadas  
telefonicas obscenas, de forma a incluir todas as formas de comunicacao. Em 
linguajar juridico: "Qualquer um que transmita ou faca disponivel  qualquer 
comentario, sugestao, proposta, imagem ou outra comunicacao que e' obscena, 
lasciva,  suja  ou  indecente, atraves de um  aparelho  de  telecomunicacao 
(nota:  isso inclui fax), estara' sujeito a US$ 100.000 de multa ou 2  anos 
de prisao".
     O  FBI, qualquer coisa vagamente parecida com nossa  policia  federal, 
poderia  prender qualquer um que veiculasse pornografia na rede,  tal  como 
aconteceu  com um casal, Robert and Carleen Thomas. Eles tinham uma BBS  em 
San Jose', na California. Somente para adultos. Um policial, em Memphis, no 
Tennenssee   descobriu  sobre  isso.  Fez  o  download  de  algumas   fotos 
"educativas".   Com base nisso, preencheu uma acusacao de  distribuicao  de 
imagens pornograficas via computador. Para encurtar a historia: o casal foi 
julgado  no  Tennenssee, por um juri local (talvez um  bando  de  velhinhos 
conservadores)  e o veredito foi de mais ou menos 3 anos na  prisao.  Sendo 
que  prisao la' nos EUA e' prisao mesmo. Pode ate' ser mais confortavel  do 
que uma brasileira, mas .. nao tem essa de "visitas conjugais".
     Claro que este nao foi o unico episodio. Varios grupos se posicionaram 
em nome desta emenda. Houve o caso de um garoto que descobriu antes dos  18 
que  era  gay e atraves da rede foi procurar sua turma. A midia  criou  uma 
imagem de que a Internet possibilitava velhos pederastas a  desencaminharem 
jovens incertos de sua sexualidade. Descobriram que nesse  caso especifico, 
o cara que enviou dinheiro p. outro fugir de casa tinha menos de 18 tambem. 
Michou um pouco o movimento, mas ai' ja' se comecou o debate. E comecaram a 
sair os primeiros "browsers" com lista "censurada" de sites. Se tem um site 
que  tem  historias  de  sexo explicito,  ou  fotos  de  objetos  estranhos 
inseridos atraves do .. voce sabe, o "browser" nao deixa o sujeito acessar. 
O  pai dele, que tem a senha, acessa, mas ele nao. Legal? Sei la'. Uma  vez 
que  agora  e' lei e todo americano vai ter sua senha  internet,  os  caras 
estao inventando um monte de ameacas para justificar tal puritanismo besta.
Nao so' porque tem um bando de gente com o pe' na cova que tem medo do  que 
os  filhos  vao  descobrir  na  rede (como  se  nao  pudesse  descobrir  em 
bibliotecas,  cinemas  ou televisao),  mas tem todo um lance de  que  muita 
coisa   vai  acontecer  sem  pagar  imposto.  O  sistema   telefonico   era 
subutilizado.  Com  a  rede,  isso  muda.  Por  isso  estao  inventando   a  
Electronic Highway, que pretende "vender" informacao disponivel  livremente 
na rede Internet. Serao servicos melhores (talvez), mas tambem mais  faceis 
de  taxar.  Nao  e'  legal?
     Tudo  bem.  A  liberdade  de opiniao e  expressao  e'  protegida  pela 
Constituicao  Norte-americana,  pela  Declaracao  de  Direitos  Humanos   e 
inclusive pela Constituicao Brasileira. Uma coisa simples. Cada um  veicula 
o  que  quiser. O governo de nenhum pais nao tem nada a ver com  isso.  So' 
que a liberdade assusta. Comecou-se a criar a questao do chip Clipper, para 
permitir  apenas ao governo, a monitoria de linhas telefonicas.  Existe  um 
projeto  para  permitir  que qualquer monitoria telefonica,  seja  feita  a 
partir  da  central  telefonica.  E  o numero  de  linhas  capazes  de  ser 
monitoradas  a  partir de centrais telefonicas (existe  software  capaz  de 
"ouvir"  o que esta' sendo falado e ligar os gravadores, por  falar  nisso. 
Foi  experimentado pela primeira vez no Peru e teria sido responsavel  pela 
prisao  do  lider do Sendero Luminoso), esse numero seria igual  a  um  por 
cento de todas as linhas existentes nos EUA. Ou seja, precisando ou nao,  a 
qualquer instante, 1% de todas as linhas norte-americanas poderiam ter  uma 
escuta  ainda  melhor do que a que foi feita no caso SIVAM. Para  quem  nao 
entendeu, isso dai seria imbutido no hardware e no software telefonico.  Se 
fosse necessario, digamos, vigiar os 0,5 % de telefones do  pessoal ligado, 
ligeiramente  ligado,  ou  conhecido de um  partido  qualquer,  isso  seria 
(sera')  feito em talvez um ou dois dias. Ou menos tempo. Tudo em  nome  de 
prevenir (nao sei) ameacas terroristas em solo americano. Com certeza, um 
dia vao tentar vender esse tipo de coisa pro governo brasileiro.
     Invasao  de  privacidade? Como se isso nao bastasse,  ha'  uma  guerra 
interna  contra a exportacao de qualquer software de  criptografia,  muitos 
temem  a  proibicao  de  sistemas capazes  de  proteger  a  privacidade  da 
comunicacao de cidadoes comuns, tornando o governo o unico realmente  capaz 
de se proteger contra espionagem e/ou defender sua privacidade.
     O  cinema americano, que por exemplo, na 1a e 2a guerras criou  filmes 
estimulando o publico americano a se juntar a coisa, (o povo nao era afins. 
Na Primeira Guerra, o candidato  vencedor  das  eleicoes prometeu respeitar 
isso), esse cinema esta' soltando filmes explorando exatamente o lado  ruim 
da rede Internet, que e' a invasao da privacidade. Aqui no Brasil, nao  nos 
apercebemos  da jogada, o povo ainda esta' feliz porque o governo  nao  vai 
ter o monopolio da Internet. E se esquece que o nosso pais sempre imitou  o 
modelo norte-americano, a tal ponto que numa epoca, nosso pais era  chamado 
de "Estados Unidos do Brasil". E'  preciso  se prevenir contra a criacao de 
um  clima de medo, em que a resistencia contra esse tipo de lei  aqui  seja 
igual a zero. Ai', qualquer sujeito resolvendo  experimentar  alguma  coisa 
nova, sera enquadrado em alguma  legislacao fajuta, que nao tem nada a ver. 
E'  preciso  enxergar  que Thrillers como "A Rede"  e  "Assassino  Virtual" 
representam a exploracao de uma possibilidade remota e que a rede  Internet 
nao e' nada mais nada menos que uma ferramenta e nao um instrumento do mal. 
Caindo  na real: a Internet nao teve nada a ver com o aumento do numero  de 
assassinatos no carnaval. Nem foi responsavel pelo racismo e  discriminacao 
que infestaram a Europa pos-URSS. Nao foi ela  que estimula guerras  inter-
tribais  na Africa, coisa que permitiu o colonialismo europeu fincar o  pe' 
no continente, se aproveitando das divisoes internas.
     Estou  comentando isso por ter visto um URL no Brasil onde  se  comeca 
uma materia com o titulo "A Rede q. descrimina", associando as duas coisas. 
bem escrita, mas sensacionalista, como tantas outras que associam a Rede ao 
atentado  do  Unabomber ou procuram ver ameaca em tecnologia nova.  E'  bem 
verdade H.L. Menckem, famoso jornalista e cronista americano da 2a  guerra, 
odiava o telefone. Stalin considerava o telefone como um aparelho  perigoso 
por causa de suas caracteristicas "democratizantes" e exigiu que o  sistema 
telefonico  sovietico  fosse feito de forma a ser  facilmente  "grampeado". 
Agora, o T.R.E. coloca no jornal que ira' fiscalizar a propaganda eleitoral 
veiculada na Internet. Pode ser um primeiro passo, efemero, para se  pensar 
na volta da censura. 
     O problema e' que a Internet e' internacional. So' se pode exercer tal 
controle  sobre o servidor localizado em territorio nacional. Por  isso,  a 
iniciativa  do T.R.E, embora nao afete os brasileiros que acessam  a  rede, 
deve  ser encarada como uma ameaca. Em nome de um controle sobre o  que  e' 
veiculado  na rede, podem ser feitas leis que servirao de ferramentas  para 
amedrontar qualquer um. 
     Vendo as coisas dentro de um contexto: nos EUA, comprar revistas  como 
a Playboy, Hustler, Penthouse, e' crime em uns vinte estados. Essa lei  nao 
e'  observada,  mas e' uma ferramenta que um xerife, numa  cidade  pequena, 
pode  usar  para  estragar  a  vida  de  alguem.  Fumar  maconha,   dirigir 
embriagado,  andar  de moto sem capacete, adulterio, etc,  sao  crimes  que 
podem  ser denominados "consensuais". A pessoa que fuma 3 macos de  cigarro 
por  dia esta' cometendo suicidio (crime, se nao me engano), mas se cala  e 
consente  quanto a esse  crime. No ultimo caso, a propaganda "esse  produto 
pode  ser  prejudicial a saude" e' um sinal de que  o  sistema  legislativo 
reconhece a toxicidade do cigarro e a auto-destruicao do fumante. Mas seria 
incapaz de controlar por decreto esse gesto.
     E'  preciso  encarar o que esta' acontecendo nos EUA,  com  relacao  a 
pornografia on-line, como uma ameaca ao artigo 19, que defende a  liberdade 
de  expressao,  na  declaracao de direitos humanos. O  que  e'  pornografia 
infantil nos EUA e' propaganda de margarina na Suecia e e' comercial de  TV 
no  Brasil.  Nao  sei. As vezes voce pode ate' acreditar  q  alguem  tem  q 
policiar  e prender excessos na rede. Tem q ter algum tipo de  censura  com 
relacao ao material exposto. Okay. Quem tem esse tipo de pensamento deveria 
ler  um faq na rede sobre uma lista de discussao: "porque odeio a  America-
On-Line".  Vulgo AOL. La' tem uma lista de palavras e expressoes  proibidas 
em  forums da empresa. Para quem nao sabe a AOL e' uma especie de  Internet 
para  "muito ignorantes". Outra e' a Prodigy, que segundo me contaram,  usa 
um  software que impede o uso de qualquer palavra chula em email, tipo  sei 
la', fuck, ass, pimp, etc.Imagina sua conta Internet ser  cancelada  porque 
uma  analise mostrou que sua pessoa usa muito palavrao na  correspondencia. 
Mais  ou  menos  por ai. Ou porque voce enviou um Gif com  a  foto  de  sua 
namorada  e  mandou  p. um amigo pela rede. No caso dos EUA,  a  partir  do 
momento  em que o sujeito digitar "estou enviando um gif" numa  carta,  ele 
pode entrar numa lista negra, de gente suspeita de "trafico de  pornografia 
via computador". E nao precisa ser condenado por isto. Se for preso e solto 
depois  por  falta  de  provas, so' as manchetes  nos  jornais  ja'  sao  o 
suficiente para lhe destruir a vida. Alguem se lembra do que aconteceu  com 
os  donos  de  uma  escolinha aqui de Sao Paulo,  que  pegaram  a  fama  de 
"corruptores de menores". Mais ou menos isso. Por exemplo.
     Os jornais publicaram que o Compuserve, uma outra rede, concorrente da 
AOL (ambos ligados a Internet, mas capazes de continuar por si sos, ja' que 
sao  uma  "internet" de franquia) fechou  todas  as  listas  de   discussao 
"picantes", e depois reabriu. Claro, estava perdendo dinheiro. Uma franquia 
daquelas perde para os concorrentes se cortar acesso a um servico  popular.
Estou querendo chegar no seguinte ponto: 
     O grande atrativo da Internet e' exatamente a caixinha de surpresas, a 
cornucopia  da  fartura  da  informacao.  Se  forem  inventadas  leis  para 
"regular" esse acesso, duas coisas vao acontecer: ela vai ficar chata  como 
a televisao e controlada pela governo, como acontece com a cessao de canais 
de  TV  e radio. Os jornalistas que escrevem artigos sobre a rede  tem  que 
pensar que sera' nesse prato que irao comer, no futuro. Os net-cidadaos nao 
podem permitir que sejam controlados, na exploracao que querem fazer com os 
seus  acessos.  Falar  que a Internet discrimina e facilita  o  racismo,  a 
pornografia  e o terrorismo e' o mesmo tipo de desculpa que foi usado  pela 
revolucao de trinta, que usou o comunismo para "rasgar" a constituicao. E o 
que e' pior. E' um tipo de desculpa que pega.
     Qualquer  lei  que  for criada para regular a Internet  e  o  material 
contido  nela  so' ira' beneficiar grandes redes de  computadores  que  ja' 
contam  com um certo sistema proprio de censura e que cobram  "extra"  para 
aquele que quiser acessar a rede das redes. A Compuserve vive  distribuindo 
software  em disquetes com a propaganda de acesso "gratuito" por  X  horas. 
O  ingenuo  usa,  fala para si mesmo:  "Po^, legal,  sai' ganhando"  Usa  o 
software,  da'  o   numero do cartao de credito  quando  se  registra  "sem 
compromisso".  Depois, ao longo da sua exploracao pela rede da  Compuserve, 
descobre: "Po^, que arquivo maneiro.. vou copiar". Um tempo depois,  recebe 
a  fatura do cartao. "Mas nao era gratuito?". Vai saber se foi erro  deles? 
Ou do cara?
     A Internet abre as portas para um novo tipo de Universo. Pode abrir as 
portas  da  percepcao  para o mundo. So' nos  paises  muculmanos  se  tomou 
providencias  para  se censurar o acesso. Foi para garantir  isso  que  foi 
criada,  nos  E.U.A, a Electronic Frontier Foundation,  uma  fundacao  para 
lutar  pela  liberdade no Cyber-universo. Aqui, nao existe nada  do  genero 
ainda,  mas nao custa conscientizar as pessoas para que possam ter  opiniao 
formada,  livre de preconceitos. Uma das maiores surpresas da  minha  vida, 
foi  (mudando  de  assunto um pouco), ter lido  sobre  uma  conferencia  ou 
congresso de homossexualismo que teve no Brasil. Havia uma materia sobre um 
grupo  homossexual  de discussao, formado por lesbicas negras.  Diziam  que 
as lesbicas eram discriminadas dentro do chamado "mundo gay" e as  mulheres 
de  cor  alem dessa sentiam-se sempre objeto de piadas,  trotes  ou  outros 
comportamentos  racistas. Surpresa, ne'? Eu sempre achei que todo  gay  era 
mente aberta, exatamente por ser discriminado.. Um amigo me falou que  isso 
que eu pensava tambem era preconceito, assim como achar que todo  individuo 
de  origem niponica e' estudioso, tambem e' outro tipo de discriminacao  ou 
preconceito.  Voltando a Internet, e' preciso lutar para  conscientizar  as 
pessoas que o perigo esta' so' na cabeca de cada um e nao naquilo que esta' 
disponivel na rede. 


     THE SOCIAL FORCES BEHIND THE DEVELOPMENT OF USENET NEWS                   
     =======================================================

   Right at this moment someplace in the world, someone is being helpful (or
someone is being helped.) At the same time, others are participating in
various discussions and debates. A new communications medium is currently in
its infancy. Over the past two decades the global computer telecommunications
network has been developing. One element of this network is called Usenet
News (also known as NetNews), and this news' original carrier was called
UUCPnet (or just UUCP). The rawest principle of Usenet News is its
importance. In its simplest form, Usenet News represents democracy. The basic
element of Usenet News is a post. Each individual post consists of a unique
contribution from some user placed in a subject area, called a newsgroup. In
Usenet's very beginning (and still to some extent today) posts were trans-
ferred using UNIX's UUCP utility. This utility allows the use of phone lines
to transmit computer data among separate computers. The network (UUCPnet)
that Usenet News was transferred on, grew from the ground up in a grassroots
manner. Originally, there was no official structure. What began as two or
three sites on the network in 1979 expanded to 15 in 1980. From 150 in 1981
to 400 in 1982. The very nature of Usenet is communication. Usenet News
greatly facilitates inter-human communication among a large group of users.
 
   Inherent in most mass media is central control of content. Many people are
influenced by the decisions of a few. Television programming, for example, is
controlled by a small group of people compared to the size of the audience.
In this way, the audience has very little choice over what is emphasized by
most mass media. However, Usenet News is controlled by its audience. Usenet
News should be seen as a promising successor to other people's presses, such
as The Searchlight, The Appeal to Reason, The Jewish Daily Forward in the
U.S. and the Penny Press tradition in England. Like these other people's
presses, most of the material written to Usenet is by the same people who
actively read Usenet. Thus, the audience of Usenet decides the content and
subject matter to be thought about, presented and debated. The ideas that
exist on Usenet come from the mass of people who participate in it. In this
way, Usenet is an uncensored forum for debate - where many sides of an issue
come into view. Instead of being force-fed by an uncontrollable source of
information, people set the tone and emphasis on Usenet. People control what
happens on Usenet. In this rare situation, issues and concerns that are of
interest and thus important to the participants, are brought up. In the
tradition of Amateur Radio and Citizen's Band Radio, Usenet News is the
product of the users' ideas and will. Unlike Amateur Radio and CB, however,
Usenet is owned and controlled solely by the participants. Currently the
range of connectivity is international and quickly expanding around the world
into every nook and cranny. This explosive expansion allows growing
communication with people around the world.
 
   In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the
Department of Defense began research of fundamental importance to the
development and testing of computer communications networks. ARPA research
laid the ground work for the development of other networks such as UUCPnet.
ARPA conducted an experiment in attempting to connect incompatible mainframe
computers.(1) It was called the ARPA Computer Network (Arpanet). ARPA's stated
objectives were:
 
    "1) To develop techniques and obtain experience on inter-connecting
computers in such a way that a very broad class of interactions were possible
and
 
    2) To improve and increase computer research productivity through
resource sharing."(2)
 
   ARPA was both conducting communications research and trying to study how
to conserve funds by avoiding duplication of computer resources.(3) A
Cambridge, Mass. company, Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN), was chosen to
construct the network, and AT&T was chosen to provide the communications
lines. Arpanet was needed because it was found that a data connection over
existing telephone voice lines was too slow and not reliable enough in order
to have a useful connection.(4) Packet-switching was developed for use as the
protocol of exchanging information over the lines. Packet-switching is a
communications process in which all messages are broken up into equal size
packets which are transmitted interspersed and then re-assembled. In this
way, short, medium and long messages get transferred with minimum delay.(5)
 
   The Arpanet was a success. ARPA provided several advances to communi-
cations research. Arpanet researchers were surprised at the enthusiastic
adoption of electronic mail (e-mail) as the primary source of communication
early on. E-mail was a source of major productivity increase through the use
of the Arpanet.(6) By 1983, the Arpanet officially shifted from using NCP
(Network Control Program) to TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet
Protocol.) A key point to TCP/IP's success is in its simplicity. It is very
easy to implement over various platforms, and this simplicity has accounted
for its continued existence as a de facto standard of the Internet up to
today. Arpanet's lasting contribution was demonstrating how a backbone infra-
structure can serve as a connection between gateways. A gateway is a computer
or part of a computer programmed to receive messages from one network and
transfer them onto another network.

   Arpanet grew quickly to more than 50 nodes between Hawaii and Norway.(7)
However, it did not extend to all who could utilize it. Computer scientists
at universities without Department of Defense contracts noticed the advan-
tages and petitioned the National Science Foundation (NSF) for similar
connectivity. CSNET was formed to service computer scientists. CSNET was
initially financed by the NSF. Very quickly the desire for interconnection
spread to other members of the university community and CSNET grew to serve
more scientists than just computer scientists at universities. CSNET became
known as "Computer 'and' Science Network" rather than just "Computer Science
network."(8)
 
   Arpanet was phased out by the Department of Defense, and was replaced by
various internal networks (such as Milnet). The role of connecting university
communities and regional networks was taken over by an NSF funded NSFNET,
which originated as a connection for university researchers to the five
National Supercomputer Centers. CSNET and NSFNET were made possible by the
research on Arpanet. The NSFNet became the U.S. backbone for the global
network now known as the Internet.
 
   Arpanet research was pioneering for communications research.(9) Researchers
discovered the link between computer inter-connection and increased
productivity from human communication. The sharing of resources was proven to
save money and increase computer use and productivity. The development of
packet-switching revolutionized the basic methodology of connecting
computers. The source of these discoveries were the people involved. The
personnel involved in the Arpanet project were very intelligent and forward-
looking. They recognized their position of developing future technologies,
and thus did not develop products that commercial industry could (and would)
develop. Instead they understood that the communications technologies they
were developing had to come from a not-for-profit body. ARPA researchers had
no proprietary products to support, and no deadlines to meet. Either would
have tainted, or made developing networks of incompatible computers
impossible or limited. Current users of international computer networks are
in debt to the pioneers of Arpanet.
 
   So Arpanet was successful in its attempt to connect various spatially
remote computers, and thus more importantly the people who used those
computers. However, these people were either professors at Universities that
had Department of Defense research grants or employees of a limited number of
Defense Industry companies. Eventually other Universities connected through
CSNet, NSFNET, BITNET and other developing connections. There were still a
mass of people who wanted a connection, but were not in a position to gain
one. Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were
two such locations. It was in these underprivileged fertile grounds where the
grassroots computer communica-tions breakthrough of Usenet origina-ted and
developed.
 
   The UNIX operating system provides the basic tools needed to share in-
formation between computers. UNIX(10) was developed as "a system around which
a fellowship would form."(11) One of the programmers of UNIX, Dennis Ritchie,
wrote that the intended purpose of UNIX was to "encourage close
communication."(12) UNIX's general principles thus conceptually foreshadowed
the basic tenet of Usenet News. How else should one go about designing
communications programs, but on an operating system which was designed with
a basic principle of encouraging communication? The UNIX utility UUCP
(UNIX-to-UNIX CoPy) was developed in 1976 by Mike Lesk at Bell Labs. UUCP
provided a simple way of passing files between any two computers running UNIX
and UUCP. UNIX's popularity also arose from AT&T's prohibition to profit from
other than their main business, phone services, under the terms of the 1956
Consent Decree. UNIX was thus available on a "no-cost" (or very low cost)
basis. The operating system was seen as an "in-house" tool on DEC computers
and was in use throughout Bell Labs. Many Universities used the same type of
computer and were licensed by AT&T to utilize UNIX. It was thus easily
accessible. Schools picked it up, and computer science students used it to
learn about operating systems, as UNIX was a model of elegance and simplicity
compared to most operating systems of the time. UNIX became a widely used
operating system in the academic world. This paved the way for an
international public communications system to form.
 
   Usenet News was created by graduate students Tom Truscott and James Ellis
of Duke University in conjunction with graduate student Steve Bellovin of the
University of North Carolina in 1979. A 5 page leaflet introducing Usenet
News was distributed at the Winter 1980 Usenix UNIX Users' Conference in
Boulder, CO. Later that year, at the Summer Usenix Conference in Delaware the
software needed to participate in Usenet was put on the Conference tape. By
this time, Stephen Daniel had rewritten the basic programs and it was called
A-News. The software was immensely popular.
 
   Usenet was patterned to mean "UNIX Users Network." The developers thought
Usenet would be used to discuss people's problems and to share experiences
about UNIX. Usenet did provide a forum for people to solve problems with
UNIX, as AT&T provided no support for UNIX. In an early handout, Usenet is
referred to as a "poor man's Arpanet."(13) Stephen Daniel told me that people
who didn't have access to the Arpanet were hungry for similar opportunities
to communicate.(14)
 
   Usenet News has been full of surprises from the beginning. The originators
of Usenet News underestimated the hunger of the people. As the initial
intentions were to produce an easy method of communicating with other users
at the same site, the writers thought people would want to have local
bulletin boards.(15) However, people were attracted by the possibility of
communicating with others outside the local community. Even today, the wide-
spread communication is part of what makes Usenet so enticing. It was also
thought NetNews would be useful as a method of communications at individual
locations, and between sites close to each other.(16) Usenet grew as a grass-
roots connection of people. The people who utilized NetNews wanted to
communicate, and communicate they did! People have a fundamental need to
communicate and Usenet News aptly fills the bill. (See, e.g., Gregory G.
Woodbury's "Net Cultural Assumptions")
 
   Early in 1980 or 1981 the gap between Arpanet and Usenet was bridged.(17)
The University of California at Berkeley had connections to both Arpanet and
Usenet News. This allowed another pioneer, Mark Horton, to bring discussions
from Arpanet mailing lists into Usenet newsgroups.(18) This was a significant
achievement. Communities other than ARPA sponsored researchers were finally
able to see what the Arpanet had made possible. The gatewaying of Arpanet
mailing lists into Usenet attracted a wave of people. These people became
attracted to Usenet News when two Arpanet mailing lists (SF-LOVERS and
HUMAN-NETS) began to appear on Usenet.(19) These lists provided interesting
material and discussions. The size of the news feed (i.e., the raw data of
Usenet News) thus became larger and provided more for people to read. Later
other sites would serve as gateways to even more discussion lists from the
Arpanet. NetNews was also seen as a superior method of holding discussions.
Gatewaying these fa (i.e., From Arpanet) newsgroups proved to be politically
courageous. The Arpanet was only accessible by a certain group of people, and
these gateways challenged that notion. The effect on the Arpanet was
important as Steve Bellovin wrote:
 
   "The impact of Usenet on the Arpanet was more as a (strong) catalyst to
force re-examination (and benign neglect) on the strict policies against
interconnection. Uucp mail into the Arpanet became a major force long before
it was legit. And it was obviously known to, and ignored by, many of the
Powers that Were."(20)
 
   The network made possible by UUCP expanded to connect people across the
entire country. Rather early UUCP expanded internationally when the
University of Toronto Zoology Department joined the Net in May of 1981.(21) Two
companies proved helpful to this communication by distributing NetNews and
electronic mail long distance. Each UUCP site had to either pay the phone
bill to connect to the next system, or arrange for the other system to make
the phone call. System Administrators at AT&T and DEC did the footwork in
order to take e-mail and news where it might not have reached. These people
went through the trouble in order to try to see the system work. However,
easy connections were not always available. In one example, Case Western
Reserve University graduate students had to route mail across the continent
twice in order to send mail through UUCP to reach their professors who were
connected to the Arpanet next door.(22) Usenet News seems to have introduced
the idea of connectivity to the Arpanet, as gradually the Arpanet connected
to other networks until it became more known as a backbone to other networks
than a self-contained network.(23)
 
   Voluntary effort is the crucial foundation of UUCPnet and Usenet News. On
one side, there are those who donate time and energy by contributing to
Usenet's content - writing messages and answering messages or participating
in a debate. Without the time and effort put in by the users of Usenet News,
Usenet News would not be what it is today. Also important to Usenet's success
are the system administrators who make the running of Usenet News possible.
Resource-wise, NetNews takes up disk space on computers throughout the
Usenet, and phone calls often must be made to transfer the raw data of the
news. In particular, system administrators at AT&T and DEC found it
worthwhile to transport the News across the country. Certain sites emerged as
clearing houses for Usenet News and UUCP e-mail.(24) These machines served as
major relay stations of both news and e-mail. A structure grew that was
considered the "backbone" of "the net." Backbone sites formed the trunk of
the circulatory system of news and e-mail. A backbone site would connect to
other central distribution computers and to numerous smaller sites. These
central backbone sites provided a crucial organization to the Usenet
communications skeleton. People formed the center of these connections. For
example, ihnp4 at AT&T existed mainly because of Gary Murakami's effort and
only partially from management support. Usenet services and support were not
officially part of Gary's job description. After Gary left ihnp4, Doug Price
put time and effort to keep things running smoothly. Certain System
Administrators in Universities also picked up the responsibility for
distributing News and e-mail widely. Often these individuals would find ways
of having their site pick up the phone bill. Sometimes sites would bill the
recipients. However, others who received a free-connection often exchanged
that for spreading what they received to others for no charge (e.g.; Greg
Woodbury & wolves off of Duke, and plenty of others.)
 
   Initially, expansion of sites receiving Usenet News was slow. Some
statistics are shown in the table.

         *This was after Arpanet mailing lists were gatewayed
into Usenet.  (Gene Spafford, Usenet History Archives from the
Mailing List) [from Gene Spafford, Oct. 11, 1990, based on
presentation on Oct 1, 1988 for the IETF meeting.]
 
   Why did this happen? Initially Usenet was only transported via UUCP
connections. Besides UUCP, other resources were used, such as weekly
airmailing of mag-tape data to Australia to provide connectivity.(25) Today,
Usenet News travels over all types of connections. The evolving Arpanet (and
now the Internet) provided a faster way of transporting news. However, a
large number of Usenet News recipients only have connectivity via UUCP.
Universities and certain businesses can afford to connect to the Internet,
but many individuals also want a connection. Today 60% of Usenet traffic is
carried over the Internet via the instantaneous Network News Transport
Protocol (NNTP), but 40% of Usenet News is still carried through the slower
UUCP connections. From my own research using Usenet News, I have heard of
several examples of various types of connections using UUCP. These
representatives of the "fringe" give a clue to what the origins of this
communication must have been like.
 
   The number of sites receiving Usenet News continually
increased (as already illustrated) and this clearly demonstrates
its popularity. People were attracted to Usenet News because of
what it made possible. People want to communicate and enjoy the
thrill of finding others across the country (or today across the
world) who share a common interest or just to be in touch with.
Besides the common thrill, it is possible to make a serious
relationship. Usenet News makes this discovery possible because
it is a public forum. People expose their ideas broadly. This
wide exposure makes it possible to find compatriots in thought.
The same physical connections which carry Usenet News often also
transport electronic mail. Interactions and discoveries are only
made possible by the public aspect of Usenet News.  Mailing Lists
have as wide a range of discussions, but are exposed to a much
smaller sized group. The appeal of Usenet can become tiresome at
times(26), but it is rare that anyone leaves Usenet permanently.
Unless, of course, someone can't find the time to fit Usenet into
his or her life. As more universities, businesses, and
individuals connect, the value of Usenet News grows. Each new
person eventually can add his unique opinion to the collection of
thoughts that Usenet already has. Each new connection also
increases the area where new connections can be made through
cheap local phone calls. The potential for inexpensive expansion
is limited only by the oceans and other natural barriers.
 
   Arpanet has been supplemented and eventually replaced by networks like
CSnet and its successor NSFnet. Both were created by the United States
Government in response to research scientists' and professors' pleas to have
a similar connection to the Arpanet. The NSFnet was also created to provide
access to the five supercomputer computing centers around the country. And
now NSFnet as the backbone of the global provides another route for Usenet
News to be distributed. Similar to the Arpanet, NSFnet is a constant
connection run over leased lines. NetNews is distributed using the NNTP
protocol over Internet connections. This allows for News and e-mail to be
distributed quickly over a large area. Internet connections also assist in
carrying news and mail internationally. The Internet-class networks and
connections include the established government and university sponsored
connections. However much of the way individuals are connected at home is
through the phone lines and various versions of UUCP. There are also
commercial services that exist now for a fee that serve to provide
connections for electronic mail and Usenet News access, as well as access to
the Internet.
 
   Much of the development of Usenet News owes a big thanks to restrictions
on commercial uses. Where else in our society is the commercial element so
clearly separated from any entity? Many other forums of discussion and
communication become clogged and congested when advertisements use space. On
UUCPnet, people feel it wrong to assist any commercial venture through the
voluntary actions of those who use and redistribute news and e-mail. When
people feel someone is abusing the nature of Usenet News, they let the
offender know through e-mail. In this manner users keep Usenet News as a
forum that is free from the monetary benefit for any one individual. Usenet
is not allowed to be a profit making venture for any one individual or group.
Rather, people fight to keep it a resource that is helpful to the society as
a whole.
 
   On what was the Arpanet and what is now the NSFnet and the Internet, there
are Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) that exist because these networks were
initially set up, founded and financed by public monies. On these networks,
commercial usage is prohibited, which means it is also discouraged on other
networks that gateway into the NSFnet. [Unfortunately, the NSF is now en-
couraging privatization of the NSF backbone. See e.g. the U.S. Office of
Inspector General's Report on NSFnet, April, 1993 -ed] However, the
discouragement of commercial usage of the global Usenet News is separate and
developed differently from the AUP.
 
   The social network that Usenet News represents supersedes the physical
connection it rides on. The current NetNews rides on many of the physical
networks that exist today. However, if need would ever be, Usenet could re-
establish itself outside of the current physically organized networks. Usenet
News' quality is such that it will survive because of its users will. As a
peer to peer network, Usenet draws its importance. People who use Usenet News
wish to communicate with others. This communal wish means that people on
Usenet find it in their own and in the community's interest to be helpful. In
this way, Usenet exists as a world-wide community of resources ready to be
shared. Where else today is there so much knowledge that is freely available?
Usenet News represents a living library. Usenet News is only a part of the
worldwide computer networks that are "part of the largest machine that man
has ever constructed - the global telecommunications network."(27)
 
   Usenet News began with the spirit that still exists today. On several
newsgroups I posted a message with the following subject: "I want to hear
from the four corners of the Net - That means YOU!" In return I received
numerous wonderful answers. One new pioneer was going to use packet radio to
send e-mail up to the CIS's orbiting Mir Space Station in the heavens. One
person criticized Japan's lack of understanding the computer technology they
supposedly "lead". Another user from France told me how the government
charged a lot of money to access e-mail and Usenet News, and how there were
at least two other "unofficial" connections. Since the government didn't
recognize these other gateways, e-mail was to be sent via the United States
in order to reach others across the street! Certain cities (e.g., Wellington,
New Zealand and Cleveland, Ohio) have free public connections to Usenet News,
e-mail and other network resources. Others in Krakow in Poland, Australia and
the ex-USSR sent me information about their connection. Some told me of how
they made other connections possible. One user in South Africa told me how he
distributed news and e-mail and was trying to gain access to a satellite in
order to set connections up with the interior of Africa that lacks the
otherwise needed infrastructure. The world is still in the infancy of this
communications interconnectivity!
 
   The very nature of Usenet News promotes change. Usenet News was born
outside of established "networks", and transcends any one physical network.
Currently, at this time, it exists of itself and via other networks. It makes
possible the distribution of information that might otherwise not be heard
through "official channels." This role makes Usenet News a herald for social
change. Because of the inherent will to communicate, people who don't have
access to News will want access when they become exposed to what it is, and
people who currently have access will want News to expand its reach so as to
further even more communication. Usenet News might grow to provide a forum
for people to influence their governments. News allows for the discussion and
debate of issues in a mode that facilitates a mass participation. This
becomes a source of independent information. An independent source is helpful
in the search for the truth.
 
   Administrators and individuals who handle the flow of information have
been predicting the "imminent death of the net" since 1982.(28) The software
that handles the distribution of NetNews has gone through several versions to
handle the ever increasing amount of information. People who receive News
have either had to decrease 1) the number of days individual messages stay at
the site, 2) the number of newsgroups they receive; or they have had to
allocate more disk space for the storage of News. Despite all the predictions
and worries, people's desire for this communication have kept this social
network floating. Brad Templeton once wrote, "If there is a gigabit network
with bandwidth to spare that is willing to carry Usenet, it has plenty more
growth left."(29) Brad, and everyone else will be happy to know that such a
network does exist! Various research labs (including the NSF Center for
Telecommunications Research at Columbia University in New York) are close to
producing usable gigabit networks.
 
   Usenet News is a democratic and technological breakthrough. The computer
networks and Usenet News are still developing. People need to work towards
keeping connections available and fairly inexpensive, if not free, so as to
encourage the body of users to grow. There are several cities and governments
across the world where the public has access to network services as a civic
service. This direction is to be encouraged. Exclusive arrangements for
access are to be discouraged. The very nature of Usenet News means people are
going to be working for its expansion. Others will be working for the
expansion for their own gain, and I wouldn't doubt that some forces will be
an active force against expansion of Usenet. I can only ask that people
attempt to spread this document in an attempt to popularize and encourage the
use and fight for Usenet News.

   17. KEY POINT - The first gateway of Arpanet mailing lists to Usenet was
an early force to have gateways with Arpanet. Gateways to Arpanet were on the
side and in all likelihood not officially sanctioned. However, this provided
the impetus for future gateways into Arpanet. This was the first pressure on
the Arpanet to provide service to a larger number of people - a first step to
transforming of the Arpanet to become a part of the backbone on the Internet.
   18. Comment from Steve Bellovin, Oct. 10, 1990, Usenet History Archive:
"Correct. The original concept was that most of the traffic would be the form
now known as UNIX-wizards (or whatever it's called this week). Growth was
slow until Mark started feeding the mailing lists in because there was
nothing to offer prospective customers. Given a ready source of material,
people were attracted."
   19. Comment from Tom Truscott, Sept 25, 1990, Usenet History Archive: "The
very first news groups were "NET." and local groups such as "dept". Later
Horton et al. oversaw the lower-casing of NET. Only when ucbvax joined the
net did "fa" appear. Indeed I was unaware of the Arpanet mailing lists such
as human-nets until ucbvax enlightened us."

from Lauren Weinstein, Nov. 23, 1992: "Greetings. It's all too easy to
forget, even for those of us who were there all along, how "small" it all
started. When I was at UCLA-ATS (ARPAnet site 1) in the early 1970s, even
small mailing lists could cause concern. I still distinctly remember the
concerns regarding network loading from Geoff Goodfellow's NETWORK-HACKERS
mailing list (this was in the days when "hacker" didn't have the negative
meaning it has picked up since then) as the list passed *100* addresses. A
list about wine (WINE-TASTERS, I believe it was called) which was mentioned
in "Datamation" magazine caused memos to be sent out from the powers-that-be
about "official use" of the net. There was also a lot of hand-wringing about
the 255 site limit (that is, a limit on the number of IMPs [Interface Message
Processors -ed]) in the network topology under NCP [Network Control Program
-ed]. It's quite remarkable how much we accomplished on what by today's
standards were slow machines with "tiny" amounts of memory, running with a 56
Kbit network backbone!"

Archives: "Indeed. I suspect that there are any number of examples of this,
but the most egregious in my experience was at CWRU. The ECMP department had
a VAX 11/780 on Usenet ("cwruecmp"), and the campus computer center had a
DEC-20 in the room next door. The machines were separated by a grand total of
about 30 feet and a piece of wallboard, but the computer center was not at
all interested in "catering" to "those CS types" by stringing an RS-232 line
between them. So, it was possible to send mail between them, but only by
sending via a route resembling:
  crwuecmp => decvax => ucbvax (UUCP)
  ucbvax => columbia (CU20A, I think)
            (Arpanet)
  columbia => cmu-cs-c => cwru20
             (CCnet)
   Yup, that's three networks, and two coasts just to get through a piece of
sheetrock :-). Took about a week, too."
   23. Alexander McKenzie, "Indeed, during a typical measurement period in
June 1988, over 50% of the active Arpanet hosts were gateways, and they
accounted for over 80% of the traffic." pg. 369
   24. At AT&T, the computers "research", then "allegra", then "ihnp4" served
as major mail and/or news distribution sites. At DEC - "decvax" gradually
increased its role (e.g., "decvax" in New Hampshire would call long distance
to San Diego across the country.)

                   BULGARIAN VIRUS FACTORY (CONTINUACAO)
                   =====================================

3) New ideas.
=============
 
As it can be seen from the examples above, the whole of Bulgaria has
turned into some kind of computer virus developing laboratory, where
any capable (or not so capable) pupil/student/ programmer is tempted
to write his own virus and to test it in the wild. It is not
therefore unusual that several completely new ideas were first
developed in our country. I shall try to enumerate here some (only
the most important) of them.
 
 
- The interrupt tracing technique, capable of finding the original
  handler (in DOS or BIOS) of any interrupt vector, has been first
  implemented in the YANKEE DOODLE (TP) viruses. Later other viruses in
  the world began to use it (4096, NAUGHTY HACKER).
 
- The "fast infectors" --- viruses that infect on file opening or
  even on any file operation were first developed in Bulgaria. The
  first such virus was the DARK AVENGER. Now there are a lot of fast
  infectors. One of them --- 1963 --- even infects on file deletion.
 
- The "semi--stealth" viruses --- viruses that hide the increasing of
  the size of the infected files (the 651 virus) or that remove them
  from the inflected files when one loads them with a debugger (YANKEE
  DOODLE) both are viruses, made in our country.
 
- Hiding the true file length usually causes problems, because CHKDSK
  is able to detect the difference between the disk space marked as
  used in the FAT and the reported file length. Only two Bulgarian
  viruses in the world are able to handle this problem --- DIAMOND and
  V2100.
 
- The first really "stealth" file infector --- the 512 virus was
  Bulgarian. It is true however, that the idea has been discovered
  independently almost at the same time in other parts of the world
  (the 4096 virus from Israel).
 
- The only known stealth parasitic virus, which "stealthy" features
  go down to the BIOS level (i.e., it cannot be detected if active in
  memory even if the infected file is read at sector and not at file
  level) is the Bulgarian INT13 virus.
 
- One of the first multi--partite viruses (viruses that are able to
  infect both files and boot sectors) --- the ANTHRAX virus, has been
  developed in Bulgaria. It is true, however, that similar ideas can be
  noticed in the 4096 and GHOST BALLS viruses, which are developed much
  earlier. Also, other multi--partite viruses (VIRUS-101, V-1, FLIP,
  INVADER) were created independently almost at the same time (and even
  earlier) in other parts of the world.
 
- The idea first used in the LEHIGH virus --- to place the virus body
  in an unused part of the file COMMAND.COM has been further developed
  by several Bulgarian viruses. They all can infect any COM or EXE file
  (unlike the LEHIGH virus) in the usual way, but when they are
  infecting the command interpreter, they place themselves in an area
  filled with zeros at the end of the file and thus in this case they
  do not increase its length. Such viruses are TERROR, NAUGHTY HACKER
  and others.
 
- The method, mentioned above has been developed even further by
  other Bulgarian viruses. They have noticed that any sufficiently
  large area of zeros in any file (not just COMMAND.COM) can be used to
  hide the virus body. The viruses that use this method are again of
  Bulgarian origin --- PROUD, EVIL, PHOENIX, RAT, DARTH VADER... The
  latter even does not write to the infected files --- it leaves this
  task to DOS. And the RAT virus hides itself into the unused part of
  the EXE file headers.
 
- One of the extremely mutating viruses is the Dark Avenger's virus
  LEECH. It can exist in more than 4.5 billion variants. It is true,
  however, that this is neither the first entirely mutating virus (1260
  being the first), nor it has the most flexible mutating mechanism (it
  is much simpler than V2P6Z).
 
- A completely new type of computer virus (DIR II) has been developed
  by two Bulgarian pupils. This virus does not infect neither files,
  nor boot sectors. Instead, it infects file systems as a whole, or
  more exactly --- directory entries.
 
- Different tricks to get control without directly hooking the INT
  21h vector were developed by several Bulgarian virus writers. The
  TERROR virus places a JMP instruction to its body in the original INT
  21h handler in DOS. The viruses from the PHOENIX family ( 800, 1226,
  PROUD, EVIL, PHOENIX) hook an interrupt that is called by DOS on
  every file--related function (INT 2Ah, AH=82h). The DIR II virus
  patches itself in the chain of DOS disk device drivers.
 
- The first virus, that is able to infect device drivers (SYS files
  only), is, of course, Bulgarian. This is the HAPPY NEW YEAR ( 1600)
  virus.
 
- The first fully functional parasitic virus, written entirely in a
  high level language (Turbo PASCAL) is the Bulgarian virus SENTINEL.
 
- The Bulgarian virus ANTHRAX is the first virus that is resident in
  memory only temporary. It removes itself from there after it has
  infected the first file and then acts as a non--resident virus.
 
- The shortest memory resident virus in the IBM PC world --- only 128
  bytes --- is again developed in Bulgaria. There are reports about a
  108--byte resident virus, also from there, but they are unconfirmed
  yet.
 
- The shortest virus in the IBM PC world --- only 45 bytes long, is
  the Bulgarian virus MINIMAL-45. It seems possible, however, to
  shorten it even further --- up to 31 bytes, with a big loss of
  reliability.
 
4) Why so many viruses are created in Bulgaria.
===============================================
 
Computer viruses are created in all parts of the world, not only in
Bulgaria. However, the portion of them that are created in our
country is extremely high. Therefore, in the whole world there exist
preconditions that make virus writing tempting, but in Bulgaria there
exist specific conditions as well.
 
4.1) Specific reasons for virus writing in Bulgaria.
----------------------------------------------------
 
4.1.1)
 
The first, and most important of all is the existence of a
huge army of young and extremely qualified people, computer wizards,
that are not actively involved in the economic life.
 
The computerization in Bulgaria began without economical reasons.
Since our country was a socialist one, its economics was of
administrative type. The economics didn't need to be computerized. In
fact, computers and planned economics are quite incompatible ---
computers help you to produce more in less time and with less effort
and money, while the goal of a manager in a planned economics is to
fulfil the plan exactly as it is given --- for no more and no less
time, and with no more and no less money. However, the communist
party leaders in Bulgaria decided that we should computerize ---
mainly to be able to supply computers to the Soviet Union and
circumvent the embargo.
 
While computerization in itself is not a bad thing, we made a very
severe mistake. Bulgarian economics was very weak (now it is even
weaker), but we had quite a lot skilled people. Therefore, we should
not have tried to produce hardware while we had good chances in the
software industry, where mainly "brainware" is required. However,
Bulgaria did just the opposite. Instead of buying the hardware, we
began to produce it (mainly illegal Apple and IBM clones). Instead of
producing our own software and to try to sell it in the West, we
began to steal Western computer programs, to change some copyright
notices in them, and to re--sell them (mainly in Bulgaria, in the
Soviet Union, and in the other countries of the former Eastern
block).
 
At that time most Western software was copy protected. Instead of
training our skilled people in writing their own programs, we began
to train them to break copy protection schemes. And they achieved
great success in this field. The Bulgarian hackers are maybe the best
in cracking copy protected programs. Besides, they had no real hope
in making and selling their own programs, since, due to the total
lack of copyright law on computer software, it was impossible to sell
more than two or three examples of a computer program in Bulgaria.
The rest were copied.
 
Since the introduction of computers in the Bulgarian offices was not
a natural process, but due to an administrative order, very often
these computers were not used --- they were only considered as an
object of prestige. Very often on the desk of a company director,
near the phone, stood a personal computer. The director himself
almost never used the computer --- however sometimes his/her children
came to the office to use it --- to play games or to investigate its
internals. While the price of personal computers in Bulgaria was too
high to permit a private person to have his/her own computer, it was
a common practice to use the computer at the office for personal
reasons. At the same time, the computer education was very widely
introduced in Bulgaria. Everyone was educated in this field --- from
children in the kindergartens to old teachers that had just a few
years until pension. Since this kind of science is better
comprehended by younger brains, it is no wonder that the people, who
became most skilled in this field, were very young. Very young and
not morally grown--up. We spent a lot of effort teaching these people
how to program, but forgot to educate them in computer ethics.
Besides, the lack of respect to the others' work is a common problem
in the socialist societies.
 
4.1.2)
 
The second main reason is the wide--spread practice of software
pirating (which was, in fact, a kind of state policy) and the very
low payment of the average programmers.
 
As was mentioned above, Bulgaria took the wrong decision in producing
computers and stealing programs. There is still no copyright law,
concerning computer software there. Because of this, the software
piracy was an extremely widespread practice. In fact, almost all
software products used were illegal copies. Most people using them
have never seen the original diskettes or original documentation.
Very often there was no documentation at all.
 
Since all kinds of programs (from games to desktop publishing
systems) were copied very often, this greatly helped for the spread
of computer viruses.
 
At the same time, the work of the average programmer was evaluated
very low --- there were almost no chances to sell his/her software
products. Even now, a programmer in Bulgaria is paid 100 to 120 times
less than the programmer with the same qualification in the USA.
 
This caused several young people to become embittered against the
society that was unable to evaluate them as it should. There is only
one step in the transformation of these young people into creators of
destructive viruses. Some of them (e.g., the Dark Avenger) took this
step.
 
4.1.3)
 
The third major reason is the total lack of legislative against
creation and willful distribution of computer viruses and against
illegal access and modification of computer information in general.
 
 
Because of the lack of copyright laws on computer software, there is
no such thing as ownership of computer information in Bulgaria.
Therefore, the modification or even the destruction of computer
information is not considered a crime --- since no one's property is
damaged.
 
The Bulgarian legislature is hopelessly old in this area.
Furthermore, even if the appropriate law is accepted in the future,
as a punishing law it will not be able to be applied to crimes,
committed before it was passed. Therefore, the virus writers still
have nothing to fear of.
 
That is why, the creation of new computer viruses has become some
kind of sport or entertainment in Bulgaria.
 
4.1.4)
 
The next reason is the very weak organization of the fight against
computer viruses in Bulgaria. Just now our country is in a very deep
economical crisis. We lack funds for everything, including such basic
goods as food and gasoline. At the same time, the organization of the
virus fight would require money --- for the establishment of a
network of virus test centers that collect and investigate computer
viruses, centers equipped with the best hardware, centers that are
able to communicate between themselves and with the other similar
centers in the world in an effective way. Such an effective way is
the electronic mail system --- and Bulgaria still does its first
steps in global computer communications. All this requires a lot of
money --- money that our government just does not have now. 4.1.5)
Another reason is the incorrect opinion, that the society has on the
computer virus problem.
 
Still, the victims of a computer virus attack consider themselves as
victims of a bad joke, not as victims of a crime.
 
4.1.6)
 
The least important reason, in my opinion, is the availability and
the easy access to information of a particular kind.
 
All kind of tricks how to fool the operating system circulate among
the Bulgarian hackers. Some of them are often published in the
computer related magazines. As it was mentioned above, there is even
a specialized BBS, dedicated to virus spreading and a special (local
to Bulgaria) FidoNet echo, dedicated to virus writing. Not to mention
the well--known file INTERxyy, published by Ralf Brown from the USA
as shareware. It is very popular in Bulgaria, since it contains,
carefully described, a huge number of undocumented tricks.
 
However, this is not a very important reason. Usually those, who have
decided to make a virus already know how to do it, or, at least, can
figure it out by themselves. They do not need to take an existing
virus and to modify it. The proof is the prevalence of original
Bulgarian viruses over the variants of known ones, as well as the
fact, that many new ideas for virus writing were first invented and
implemented in Bulgaria.
 
4.2) General reasons.
---------------------
 
Since viruses are also created in all the other parts of the world,
there should be also some general reasons for this. These reasons
are, of course, valid for Bulgaria too. Let's see these general
reasons.
 
4.2.1) Wish for glory.
 
Every programmer dreams that his/her program gets widely spread and
used. A lot of very good programmers write and distribute wonderful
software packages for free --- with the only intention to have more
users using their package. However, for a program to be used, it has
to be good enough. And not every programmer is able to make a program
so good that the users will widely use it --- even for free. At the
same time, computer viruses do spread very widely, regardless and
even against the users' will. So, when a virus writer reads in a
newspaper that his virus has been discovered at the other end of the
world, he feels some kind of perverted pleasure. Some people write
viruses just to see their names (or the names of their viruses)
published in the newspapers. This reason has yet another aspect. In
the beginning of the virus era, when the idea of the computer virus
was very new, only the very good programmers were able to make a
virus. It became a common myth that if you can write a virus, you're
a great programmer. This myth might have been justified at the
beginning, but now it is completely without sense. Nevertheless,
young hackers began to write viruses --- just to prove to their
friends and to the rest of the world how good programmers they are.
Some of them were really unable to invent something original ---
that's why they just picked a known virus, modified it a bit and
released this new mutation. This explains why there are so many
variants of the simplest viruses that were first created --- BRAIN,
JERUSALEM, STONED, VIENNA, CASCADE... A typical example is the
Italian virus writer, who calls himself Cracker Jack.
 
4.2.2) Simple human curiosity.
 
One has to admit that the idea of a computer program that is able to
spread by its own means, to replicate, to hide from the user (who is
believed to maintain the computer under full control), and in general
to behave as a real live being is really fascinating. Just simple
human curiosity is sufficient to make some people, if they are young
and irresponsible enough, to try to make a computer virus. Some of
them do succeed. A greater and greater part, if we consider the
amount of last reports for new viruses. Some of them claim that they
are writing viruses "only for themselves," "only for fun," and that
"they do not spread them." However, it is often impossible to fully
control the spread of a "successful" computer virus. The more clever
these viruses are, the greater the probability that they will
"escape." There is an idea to teach students how viruses are made ---
of course in a very strongly restricted environment. Maybe at least
for some this will fulfil their curiosity and they will not be
tempted to write their own virus. Maybe if we force every computer
science student to learn Dr. Fred Cohen's theorems on the
computational aspects of computer viruses, if we administer an exam
and ask students to design a virus protection scheme or to help a
cluster of users, attacked by a computer virus for a course work ---
well, maybe in this case these students will have more than enough of
the computer virus problem and will not want to hear about it any
more --- least to make their own viruses. 4.2.3) Easy access to
information.
 
Sufficient information, needed to write a virus can be found easily.
This information is often even more accessible than in Bulgaria.
 
The person that wants to write an average virus needs only to dig in
the respective manuals --- manuals, which are often not available in
Bulgaria. However, the usefulness of the easy access to this
information is much greater than the damage, caused by the fact that
it is used by the virus writers.
 
4.2.4) Military interests.
 
It is often rumoured that the superpowers are working on the problem
how to use computer viruses to destroy the enemy computers' software.
It is even very probable, that in several countries such research is
performed. There are reports on this from the USA, France and the
USSR.
 
This is no wonder --- it is the right of every military force to
investigate any new idea and to consider the possible usefulness
and/or threats it might bring to the national defense. However, it is
quite improbable that the computer viruses can be used for this
purpose. Just like the live viruses, the computer ones are able to
spread only among individuals with very similar immunotype, i.e. ---
among compatible computers. The most widely used kinds of personal
computers are the IBM PC, Macintosh, Amiga and Atari ST. It is
therefore no wonder that the vast majority of existing computer
viruses are able to infect only these computers. In the same time,
viruses that infect one kind of computer (say, IBM PC), are unable to
spread (or even to run) on another (e.g., a Macintosh). They are
usually not able to run even on two different operating systems in
one and the same computer. Even a different version of the same
operating system might cause big problems to a particular computer
virus --- up to preventing it to work. The common personal computers
are never assigned important tasks in the army. Therefore, even if a
virus infects them, and even if it destroys all the data on all such
computers, the caused damage will not be of great importance.
Computers that are used for the really important things, such as
rocket leading or cannon aiming, are always specialized ones. Their
programs are usually hard--coded and only data can be entered in
them. It is not possible to insert an infected IBM PC diskette in the
computers that control the NORAD system. At the same time, the
computers that control different important devices are usually
incompatible even between themselves. Therefore, even if someone
writes a virus for a specialized rocket computer, this virus will not
be able to infect the computers of a strategic bomber or even these
of a rocket of a different system. So, such virus will not spread
very much. And last, but not least, such virus has to be placed
somehow in the enemy's computers. Since, as we saw above, it won't be
able to spread from one computer to another of a different kind,
obviously someone has to insert it in the victim computer. But if you
have access to the enemy's computers, you don't need a virus. You can
do the same task easier (and often much better) "manually", or with a
Trojan horse or a logic bomb. 4..2.5) Corporate interests.
 
It is also often speculated that the large software companies and the
producers of anti--virus software make or willfully spread computer
viruses.
 
There is some reason behind this. Indeed the fear of viruses can make
the user buy only original software (sometimes --- quite expensive),
and not to use pirated copies, shareware or freeware. At the same
time, companies that produce anti--virus software are interested that
their products are sold. And they will be, if the user needs
anti--virus protection. However, it is rather improbable, that a
software company (whether producing or not anti--virus software) will
take the risk to become known that it willfully spreads viruses. It
will be probably boycotted by its users and the losses of income will
be much greater than any gains. As to the producers of anti--virus
software, they don't need to write viruses themselves, in order to
sell their programs. It is sufficient to use the hype that the media
accords to the problem, to mention how many viruses there are and how
many of them their wonderful product is able to defeat.
 
5) The Soviet virus factory and virus writing in the other countries
=====================================================================
                 of the former Eastern block.
                 ============================
 
While Bulgaria was one of the best computerized countries in East
Europe, the political, economical, and social conditions in the other
countries were (and maybe still are) quite similar. That is why the
virus writing and spreading has been developed in these countries
too.
 
Viruses are created in Poland ( W13, 217, 583, FATHER CHRISTMAS, DOT
EATER, JOKER, VCOMM, AKUKU, 311, HYBRYD), in Hungary ( STONE `90,
FILLER, MONXLA, POLIMER, TURBO KUKAC), in Czechoslovakia (the
AANTIVIRUS virus), and even in Yugoslavia ( 17Y4, SVIR). According to
some reports from Romania, there are no viruses written there, but
the W13, YANKEE DOODLE, DARK AVENGER and StONED viruses are quite
widespread.
 
However, the country most similar to Bulgaria is, undoubtedly, the
Soviet Union. According to the Soviet anti--virus researcher Bezrukov
[Bezrukov], the first virus appeared there almost at the same time as
in Bulgaria and, by the way, it was the same virus ( VIENNA). So, the
preconditions are almost the same as with our country.
 
There are, however, two main differences: the level of
computerization and the number of virus writers.
 
The level of computerization is still much lower than in Bulgaria.
There are much fewer computers per person than in our country. The
users are much more isolated, due to the much larger distances. The
telephone network is in the same miserable condition, as in Bulgaria.
The networks are very few and not widely used. For instance, in Sofia
alone there are more FidoNet nodes than in the whole Soviet Union. It
is not safe to send floppy disks by regular mail, since they will be
probably stolen. All this delays very much the spreading of viruses.
Unfortunately, it also delays the distribution of anti--virus
products and the information exchange between the anti--virus
researchers. For instance, examples of new viruses created there
reach the Western anti--virus researchers with huge delays.
Unfortunately, the other factor is much more dangerous. In the USSR
there are much more programmers than in Bulgaria and they seem at
least as much motivated in creating new viruses. The virus writing in
the Soviet Union is currently in the same state as it was in Bulgaria
about three years ago. However, at that time only nine variants of
known viruses and one stupid original virus has been created there (6
VIENNA variants, 3 AMSTRAD variants, and the OLD YANKEE virus). At
the first Soviet anti--virus conference in Kiev (mid--November, 1990)
more than 35 different viruses of Russian origin were reported.
 
Some of them were variants of known viruses, while others were
completely new. It has been noticed that the Soviet virus writers are
less qualified than the Bulgarian ones, but they use a destructive
payload in their creations much more often.
 
Since the reasons of virus writing in the USSR are very similar to
those in Bulgaria; since this virus writing occurs in a much larger
scale; and since no steps are taken by the authorities in order to
stop it, it is possible to predict that in the next few years the
Soviet Union will be far ahead of Bulgaria in computer virus creation
and that a new, much larger wave of computer viruses will come from
there. Probably after a year, several (up to ten) virus writers with
the qualification of the Dark Avenger will emerge from there.
 
6) The impact of the Bulgarian viruses on the West and on the national
======================================================================
                     software industry.
                     ==================
 
While a huge part of the existing viruses are
produced in Bulgaria, a relatively very small part of them spread
successfully to the West. Of more than 160 Bulgarian viruses, only
very few ( DARK AVENGER, V2000, V2100, PHOENIX, DIAMOND,
NOMENKLATURA, VACSINA, YANKEE DOODLE) are relatively widespread. At
the same time some of them ( DARK AVENGER, V2000, YANKEE DOODLE,
VACSINA) are extremely widespread. According to John McAfee, about 10
% of all infections in the USA are caused by Bulgarian viruses ---
usually by the DARK AVENGER virus. In West Europe this virus shares
the popularity with YANKEE DOODLE and VACSINA.
 
Of the viruses listed above, the major part are written by the Dark
Avenger --- all except YANKEE DOODLE and VACSINA. Almost all his
viruses (in this case --- with the exception of DIAMOND, which is the
least spread) are extremely destructive. The PHOENIX and NOMENKLATURA
viruses corrupt the FAT in such a subtle way, that when the user
notices the damage, there is no way to disinfect the infected files
and even to determine which files are damaged. The only way is to
reformat the hard disk.
 
It is difficult to estimate the costs of all damage caused by
Bulgarian viruses. There are reports from Germany about a 10,000,000
DM damage, caused only by the VACSINA virus. It is probable, however,
that these numbers are largely overestimated.
 
The huge number of known Bulgarian viruses causes also indirect
damage to the West community, even if the viruses themselves do not
escape from Bulgaria, but only examples of them are supplied to the
anti--virus researchers. These researchers have to develop
anti--virus programs against these viruses (just in case the latter
succeed to spread outside Bulgaria). Therefore, they have to waste
their time and efforts. Furthermore, the user is forced to buy new
anti--virus programs (or pay for updates of the old ones), in order
to feel safe against these viruses. In the same time, the creation
and spreading of Bulgarian viruses causes a lot of damage to the
Bulgarian economics. In Bulgaria, the Bulgarian viruses are much more
widespread. More than 80 % of about 160 known Bulgarian viruses have
been detected in the wild in our country. It is difficult, however,
to evaluate, or even to estimate the exact costs of the caused
damage, since in Bulgaria the term "property of computer information"
simply does not exist in legal sense. It is the same with the cost of
this information. In fact, the creation of computer viruses causes
also indirect damage to our economics. First of all, a lot of
extremely capable people are wasting their minds to create
destructive viruses, instead of something useful. Second, the fact
that the Bulgarian programmers use their time to create computer
viruses destroys their reputation as a whole. No serious software
company accepts to deal with Bulgarian programmers or software
companies, because it is afraid that the supplied software might be
pirated or might contain a virus. 7) Conclusion. Virus writing in
Bulgaria is an extremely widespread hobby. Most of the major virus
writers are known, but no measures can be taken against them. Their
work causes a lot of damage to the Western community, as well as to
the national economics. Therefore, it is urgent to take legal
measures in this direction; measures that will make virus writing and
willful spread of computer viruses a criminal act. This is the only
way to stop, or at least to reduce the threat.

Scarry Tale: (Vulgo historia de terror)  

Observacao:  Isto  dai  foi copiado da revista  2600,  um  numero 
antigo.  Tenho  a  permissao  do editor.  Nao  conheco  a  pessoa 
envolvida no lance mas sinto que e' necessario instruir a mocada, 
e  a  melhor  forma  e' usar essa historia.  Pedi  pra  um  amigo 
traduzir  e nao tive tempo de corrigir, vou avisando. Dito  isso, 
boa (?) leitura:

  
Amigo 2600  
  
Que  isto  que aconteceu comigo sirva de licao para aqueles que  entram  no 
mundo   ilegal.  
Na  noite de 27 de junho de 1988 eu voltava para casa com alguns amigos  as 
1:45    da manha. Estacionei o meu carro na frente do meu  apartamento.  Eu 
sou,   normalmente uma pessoa preocupada com seguranca, vivo olhando  sobre 
o  meu   ombro e nunca super estimo a minha seguranca.  Muitas  pessoas  me 
conhecem  no mundo IBM/Apple modem hacking. Mas suncam deixo as pessoas  me   
conhecerm suficientemente bem.  Pelo menos assim eu pensava.  Assim que  eu 
pisei  na calcada da frente do meu apartamento, escutei alguem  chamando  o 
meu  nome. Senti que algo estava errado. A policia local, detetives  a    e 
agentes do FBI estiveram me observando e esperando o dia todo.
Instantaneamente  havia  carros de policia por toda parte  e  estava  sendo 
algemado    e  revistado. Toda a vizinhanca acordou com o  movimento  e  as 
luzes.   Certamente  eu  nao disse um palavra. Eu sabia  que  eles  queriam 
entrar no meu   apartamento e discutir a questao la dentro. Eu tambem sabia 
melhor  do  que    ninguem  que  nao se deve  guardar  nada  que  possa  te 
comprometer no teu apartamento.   Eu nao ia facilitar o trabalho deles.
Bem, isto foi a seis meses e desde entao estou preso.  
Naquela noite me levaram para uma pequena e conservadora cidade do campo  a 
250  milhas,  eu nunca tinha estado la antes. Eu estava  sendo  acusado  de 
fraude   por computador com um prejuiso de US$ 150.000,00. Meus pais  moram 
em outra parte do pais e eu mantenho pouco contato com eles e diferente  da 
juventude  atual e   nao posso ligar para papai e mamae e pedir que  venham 
me salvar e pagar as minhas dividas.
Eu  preciso agora pagar pelos meu proprios erros, mas a maneira com eu  foi 
pego   mostra que qualquer que tenha atividade ilegais precisa tomar  muito 
cuidado.   Em fevereiro de 1988 eu encontrei um pessoa que me  conhecia  de 
varias BBS. Nos estavos frequentando a mesma escola, e entao eu decidi  que 
deviamos nos encontrar.
Jantamos  juntos  e  conversamos muito. Estava  indo  bem,  mas  em  nenhum 
momento  eu revelei o meu verdadeiro nome. Claro isto isto e  perfeitamente  
normal e bem aceito em "comunidade modem" .
Esta  foi  a  ultima vez que o vi. Mais ou menos um  mes  atras  este  este 
"amigo" foi   visitado pela policia local. Provavelmente um outro Hacker  ( 
estou  usando o termo genericamente) que tinha um pouco de rancor do  nosso 
"amigo",   como uma especie de viganca revelou para a policia que este  meu 
"amigo" era um "code abuser".  
Imediatamente suas linhas telefonicas foram grampeadas.  
Tres  meses  depois  e trinta rolos DNR de papel a  procura  terminou.  Sua 
residencia   foi  cercada  e  todos  os  equipamentos   telefonicos   foram 
apreendidos   para examinacao. Este nosso "amigo" foi sufientemente esperto 
para  nao  falar  nada sem a presenca de um advogado.  Entao  a  policia  o 
liberou  sem multas,   naquele momento.  Ele foi esperto em  ficar  quieto, 
que pena que esta conduta nao continuou.
A maioria das pessoas subestima os detetives da policia ou FBI. Nunca pense 
desta maneira.
Meu  "amigo"  foi interrogado muitas veses depois, hoje eu tenho  todos  os 
interrogatorios.  Ele revelou varios nomes que forneceram codigos,  senhas, 
contas    etc.  Ele tambem disse que tinha  um amigo que  vivia  atualmente 
neste   estado  que estava envolvidos em avarias  atividades  similares  as 
dele. Ele disse a   policia o que sabia sobre mim, que nao era muito,  nome 
e sobrenome que ele   achava ser os meus.
Algum  tempo depois a policia voltou  perguntando se ele sabia mais  alguma 
coisa   ao meu respeito, pois eles nao tinham encontrado nada sobre  aquela 
pessoa.  Ele  podia ter pensado tudo menos que talves eu tivesse algum  dia 
morado em outra  regiao.
Muitos  anos atras eu foi preso, junto com alguns amigos  tentando  comprar 
bebida  alcoolica.  Fomos liberados sem multa daquela vez  mas  minha  foto 
ficou nos arquivos da policia. Minha descricao foi enviada para todo o pais 
e retornaram  inumeras fotos que se encaixavam na descricao.  
O  relatorio da policia diz que o nosso "amigo" apontou para a foto 13  sem  
exitacao,  dizendo ser o sujeito procurado.  No dia seguinte foram tomas  a 
devidas precaucoes por parte da policia e aqui  estou eu na prisao federal.
Desde  aquele  dia  eu nao disse uma palavra. Nao disse  nada  que  pudesse 
aliviar  a minha pena, como fornecer nomes.  Mas agora e tarde eu estava no 
meu  ultimo  ano  da faculdade e estava fazendo curso de  verao.  Tinha  um 
excelente  emprego  com o DoD (Departamento de Defesa) e o meu  futuro  era  
promissor. Eu nao ia fazer mais nada ilegal e ia andar na linha.
Todo isto se foi agora. Mesmo se eu sair da cadeia sem multas, eu ja  perdi 
o   semestre  inteiro na faculdade e tenho poucas esperancas de ter  o  meu 
emprego   de volta depois da vinda do FBI ao meu escritorio. Eu perdi  seis 
meses da minha  vida para sempre.
Minha  prisao foi noticiada em todos os jornais e meu futuro  neste  estado 
parece  dificil.  
A juventude e uma provacao.  
A  mensagem desta carta e caso voce ingrece no mundo ilegal nao  confie  em  
ninguem. Nao existe uma unica pessoa que voce possa confiar. Quando mais de  
uma pessoa e presa sao oferecidas vantagens para quem testemunhar contra os  
amigos.  Eu  nao guardo rancores da pessoa que me pos  nesta  situacao.  Eu  
estaria  mentindo  se  dissesse que nunca fiz  nada  errado.(...    ...)  E 
terrivel  que   que  vivamos numa epoca em que  amigos  de  outrora,  agora 
testemunham contra voce.  
Caso  se  encontre  algum dia numa situacao como a  minha,  nunca  e  pouco 
lembrar   quanto  e  importante nao dizer nada, nunca faca  algum  tipo  de 
acordo.  A  policia  nao esta aqui para te ajudar. Nunca  tente  mentir  ou 
engana-los.  Eles  tem mais recursos doque voce pode imaginar.  Eu  escutei 
pessoas  dizer  que  "saberiam  exatamente oque faze e  dizer"  caso  sejam 
presas, mas tristemente, quando se  vive a situacao, e impressionante  como 
muitas pessoas nao aguentam. A policia e  boa no que ela faz. Ele  disseram 
varias vezes que ja tinha quase 36 anos.
A melhor coisa a fazer em tal situacao e contratar um advogado. Eles  podem  
descobrir  exatamente  oque a policia sabe a seu respeito e qual  e  a  sua  
verdadeira situacao.
Se  os adolecentes tivessem me escutado antes nenhum de nos  estaria  nesta  
situacao. Minha unica esperanca e atingir aqueles que foram delatados antes 
que  eles se achem na mesma situacao.
Toda  vez  que voce deixa o seu telefone em um boletim board voce  esta  se  
expondo.  Voce confia que o sysop nunca vai revelar esta  informacao.  Voce 
esta  arriscando sua liberdade.
No  atual "Hacker world" as pessoas teram que melhorar sua  seguranca  para  
nunca se verem nesta situacao.

Linux e Apple:
--------------

Apple and Open Software Foundation Announce Linux for Power Macintosh

Leading User-Supported Version of UNIX to be Available to Power
Macintosh Users

CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts-February 5, 1996-Apple Computer, Inc.
announced today that it is supporting a project with the Open Software
Foundation (OSF) to port Linux, a freely distributed version of UNIX.,
to a variety of Power Macintosh. products. This version of Linux
operates on the OSF Mach microkernel which will be running natively on
the PowerPC microprocessor. The announcement was made at the
Conference on Freely Redistributable Software held in Cambridge. A
demo of an early prototype was shown as part of the announcement.

"This is part of Apple's overall effort to embrace more open industry
standards, particularly those popular in the Internet community," said
Ike Nassi, vice president of Apple system software technologies. "This
software will be particularly popular with Mac users in higher
education as well as the scientific research communities who have
asked for our support of Linux."

"We are pleased to be working with Apple on this important new port of
the Mach microkernel, now hosting the popular Linux environment," said
Ira Goldstein, executive vice president and chief scientist of the
Open Software Foundation. "We have a strong working relationship with
Apple and this is an important result of our cooperation."

Linux is a broadly used version of UNIX supported by a wide community
of programmers. Linux provides UNIX features such as true
multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, TCP/IP
networking and many other advanced features. Versions of Linux are
being ported to a wide variety of platforms, including other
PowerPC-based computers. This effort marks the first time that Linux
will be hosted on the Mach microkernel. (For more information, visit
the Linux Web site.)

Linux on Power Macintosh will be especially significant in several of
Apple's key markets, particularly the higher education and scientific
communities. With Linux a student will have an extremely low-cost, yet
high-performance PowerPC-based UNIX system for personal use. Advanced
research that requires UNIX applications will now be possible on an
engineer's personal Macintosh..

"As a long time Linux user, I am absolutely delighted about the
announcement of Linux on Power Macintosh," said Professor George
Blumenthal, chair of the astronomy & astrophysics department at Lick
Observatory, University of California, Santa Cruz. "Now Macs will have
a dual personality, in the best sense of the word; on the one hand
they will allow users to exploit the ever popular and easy to use
Macintosh software, while on the other hand, they now provide a
platform that appears virtually identical to the UNIX machines that
many of us use daily in our work."

Linux for Power Macintosh adds a new UNIX alternative for PowerPC
systems to existing products such as AIX from IBM and MachTen from
Tenon Intersystems. This gives Macintosh users a range of options from
a free, user supported UNIX implementation up to commercial, mission
critical solutions for large enterprises.

In keeping with the spirit of the Linux community, Apple and OSF will
make the source code for this Linux port freely available. This
includes source code to the Mach microkernel and the required
Macintosh platform driver support. Linux is distributed throughout the
world over the Internet and other means, generally through the GNU
General Public License, which allows people to use it and change it so
long as no further restrictions are imposed and that the source code
is made available.

Apple and OSF expect that the first port of Linux for Power Macintosh
will be available this summer. The system will initially support the
first generation of Power Macintosh computers based on NuBus
expansion, and will later be extended to PCI-based Power Macs as well
as the upcoming PowerPC Platform (formerly CHRP.) Information
regarding this version of Linux is available on the Linux on Power
Macintosh web site. Apple expects to make the software available at
this location as well.

This project is an outcome of Apple's ongoing relationship with OSF,
which includes consulting work for Copland, the next major release of
the Mac OS. The Linux port provides Apple an open environment for OS
research work, as well as enabling an exciting new opportunity for
Power Macintosh users. This port delivers both the Mach 3.0
microkernel (developed by the OSF Research Institute) and Linux as an
OS "personality" on Mach. The OSF microkernel was originally developed
at Carnegie Mellon as Mach and subsequently enhanced extensively by
the OSF Research Institute.




Virus no Windows 95
-------------------

Subject: Win95.Boza (WIN95)

Win95.Boza
           
It's not a dangerous parasitic NewEXE(PE)-virus. It searches for
EXE files, checks the files for the PE signature, then creates in the
EXE file a new section named ".vlad", and writes its code into
that section.

When infection occurs the virus uses calls to functions GetDir, SetDir,
FindFirst, FindNext, OpenFile, LSeek, Read, Write, and CloseFile. First,
it gets the current directory, and checks the Windows95 kernel for some
specific code. Then the virus searches for .EXE files, and checks them for
the PE signature. Then the virus increases NumberOfSections field in
PE header, writes into the file new Section Header that describes
the new Sections in the file, and writes itself to the end of the file.

When executution occurs the virus infects up to 3 files, and looks for
EXE files in parent directories, if there are no more .EXE files in the
current one. Before returning to the host program the virus restores the
current directory.

The virus checks some data (the system date?) and in some cases displays 
the messages:

 Bizatch by Quantum / VLAD
 The taste of fame just got tastier!
 VLAD Australia does it again with the world's first Win95 Virus
 From the old school to the new..
 Metabolis
 Qark
 Darkman
 Automag
 Antigen
 RhinceWind
 Quantum
 Absolute Overlord
 CoKe


The virus also contains the internal text strings:

 .vlad
 Please note: the name of this virus is [Bizatch] written by Quantum of VLAD

The virus is not bug free, and in some cases Windows95 displays a error 
message while executing of infected EXE-files.

The date you are looking for is the 31st of any month.  You will find 
further information about this virus at our website:

   http://www.drsolomon.com/vircen/boza.html

We also have a screenshot of what the dialog looks like there, AND a 
detection driver which allows users of Dr Solomon's to detect this virus 
(not that there is any reason to believe this virus is in the wild of 
course)

Hello. Probably virtually everyone reading this has heard of the Clinton
Clipper Chip Initiative. If you haven't, the rundown is that it is a proposed
standard that will allow the government to wiretap phones and other electronic
devices using the chip. An excellent article appears in this weeks Newsweek
under `Society -- Technology' (June 7 1993 p.70) with the headline `The Code 
of the Future' subhead `Uncle Sam wants you to use ciphers it can crack'.
A great collection of articles from the press and elsewhere, including the
original announcement, is available on soda.berkely.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/clipper.  Also, some documentation is
contained in the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ on
rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy.

Some very interesting comments and traffic have appeared in the risks
forum (comp.risks) on this issue. In particular D. Denning's role and
participation in the project has been called into question. Ms. Denning 
was among the first to propose a `key escrow system' in the academic realm 
(in Communications of the ACM). A massive electronic uproar ensued in 
sci.crypt after a warning sounded by T.C. May, in which Denning wrote several
messages defending the proposal and also first volunteering/introducing the
idea of `split keys' for the escrow system about eight months ago on 
sci.crypt. She has written on the internet that she was unaware of
the Clipper announcement until its public introduction on April 16.

Disturbing inconsistencies in her public statements are apparent. In
posting this information and message it is not my intent to demean or
harass Ms. Denning. However, I do believe that the scientific, electronic,
and academic communities deserve better than her evasive and duplicitous
treatment. In short, an apology is warranted, not for any political
considerations of the Clipper proposal or her involvement but because of
her unacceptable unwillingness to adhere to complete and total honesty 
among her respectful peers. Involvement in the project alone is, to
say the least, a problematic stance for many, but the barefaced denial of
participation or knowledge given strong evidence to the contrary
is completely intolerable.  It is my personal opinion that Ms. Denning
desires to be associated with the Clipper proposal only to the extent it
is successful and accepted. This cowardly misrepresentation should be
scorned.


The following is a statement by E. S. Raymond, editor of many popular
electronic documents, and Denning's reply, excerpted from:

RISKS-LIST: RISKS-FORUM Digest  Wednesday 19 May 1993  Volume 14 : Issue 64

Mr. Rotenberg, as a public figure operating in the political arena, has to
exercise a certain diplomatic restraint in responding to Ms. Denning's claims.
I am, thankfully, under no such requirement.

As a long-time RISKS reader and contributor, I observe that that this is not
the first time that Ms. Denning has apparently operated as a mouthpiece for
the NSA's anti-privacy party line on DES and related issues.

I believe Ms. Denning's remarks must be understood as part of a continuing
propaganda campaign to marginalize and demonize advocates of electronic
privacy rights.  Other facets of this campaign have attempted to link privacy
advocates to terrorists and drug dealers by suggesting that only criminals
need fear wiretapping.

These are serious charges.  I make them because, in the wake of the Clipper
proposal, I do not believe civil libertarians can afford any longer to assume
that their opponents are persons of good will with whom they can simply debate
minor differences of institutional means in a collegial way.

It's time for someone to say, in public and on this list, what I know many
of us have been thinking.  The future is *now*.  Electronic privacy issues
are no longer a parlor game for futurologists; they are the focus of a
critical political struggle, *and the opponents of privacy are fighting their
war with all the tools of force, deception, and propaganda they can command*.

The histories of the DES, the FBI wiretap proposal, and now the Clipper
proposal must be considered against a wider background of abuses including
the Steve Jackson case, "Operation Longarm", and the routine tapping of U.S.
domestic telecommunications by NSA interception stations located outside the 
geographic borders of the United States.

These form a continuing pattern of attempts by agencies of the U.S. government
to pre-empt efforts to extend First and Fourth Amendment privacy protections
to the new electronic media.  In each case, the attempt was made to present
civil libertarians with a fait accompli, invoking "national security" (or the
nastiness of "kiddie porn") to justify legislative, judicial and practical
precedents prejudicial against electronic privacy rights.

While I would not go so far as to claim that these efforts are masterminded by
a unitary conspiracy, I believe that the interlocking groups of spies,
bureaucrats and lawmen who have originated them recognize each other as
cooperating fellow-travelers in much the same way as opposing groups like the
EFF, CPSR and the Cypherpunks do.  Their implicit agenda is to make the new
electronic communications media transparent to government surveillance and
(eventually) pliant to government control.

One of the traits of this culture of control is the belief that manipulative
lying and dissemblage can be justified for a `higher good'.  

I believe that Ms. Denning's disingenuous claim that the DSS "is now
considered to be just as strong as RSA" is no mere technical misapprehension.
I believe it is propaganda aimed at making objectors non-persons in the
debate.  I cannot know whether Ms. Denning actually believes this claim, but
it reminds me all too strongly of the classic "Big Lie" technique.

It is important for us to recognize that the propaganda lie is not an
aberration, but a routine tool of the authoritarian mindset.  And the
authoritarian mindset is, ultimately, what we are confronting here --- the
mindset that regards the fighting of elastically-defined `crime' as more
important than privacy, that presumes guilt until innocence is proven, that
demands for government a license to override any individual's natural rights
at political whim.

We cannot trust representatives of an institutional culture that was
*constructed* to deal in information control, lies, secrecy, paranoia and
deception to tell us the truth.

We cannot accept the authoritarians' unverified assurances that the sealed
interior of the Clipper chip contains no `trapdoor' enabling the NSA to
eavesdrop at will.

We cannot trust the authoritarians' assertions that they have no intention of
outlawing cryptographic technologies potentially more secure than the Clipper
chip.

We cannot believe the authoritarians' claims that `independent' key registries
will prevent abuse of decryption keys by government and/or corrupt individuals.

We cannot --- we *must not* --- cede control of encryption technology to
the authoritarians.  To do so would betray our children and their descendants,
who will work and *live* in cyberspace to an extent we can barely imagine.

We cannot any longer afford the luxury of treating the authoritarians as honest
dealers with whom compromise is morally advisable, or even possible.  Whatever
their own valuation of themselves, the thinly-veiled power grab represented by
the Clipper proposal reveals a desire to institutionalize means which a free
society, wishing to remain free, *cannot tolerate*.  

Big Brother must be stopped *here*.  *Now.*  While it is still possible.

Eric Raymond has accused me of being part of a propaganda campaign and
a "Big Lie." Among his wild speculations, he wrote:

  I believe that Ms. Denning's disingenuous claim that the DSS "is now
  considered to be just as strong as RSA" is no mere technical misapprehension.
  I believe it is propaganda aimed at making objectors non-persons in the
  debate.  I cannot know whether Ms. Denning actually believes this claim, but
  it reminds me all too strongly of the classic "Big Lie" technique.

Frankly, I don't know how to respond his allegations other than by saying that
I am not and have never been on the payroll of NIST, NSA, or the FBI and that
every word I have published has been completely on my own initiative.  While I
frequently speak with people in these agencies (mainly to ask them questions
so that I can be informed) and have considerable respect for them, I am
operating on my own initiative and making my own independent evaluations based
on all the evidence I can find.  I try to avoid pure speculation as much as
possible.

My objective in responding to Sobel in the first place was to point out that,
in my best judgement, the DSS as revised is as secure as RSA.  I did that so
that readers would not be led to believe the contrary.  Let me elaborate more.

The security of the DSS is based on the difficulty of computing the discret
log.  (The Diffie-Hellman key exchange, invented in 1976, is likewise so
based.)  The security of the RSA is based on factoring.  My understanding is
that the computational difficulty of these two problems is about the same for
comparable key lengths, and indeed, the fastest solutions with both come using
the same basic technique, namely the number field sieve.  If I'm wrong here, I
am happy to be corrected by someone who knows more than I do about this.

There are other factors, of course, that must be taken into account.  With
both schemes, you have to make sure you get good primes.  In the case of the
DSS, you want really random ones so that you don't get ones with "trapdoors."
This is readily done and the chances of getting a trapdoor one are minuscule.
For a reference, see Daniel Gordon's paper from Crypto '92.

I still remember the day when George Davida called me up to say that he had
cracked RSA.  It turned out that he had found a way of exploiting the digital
signatures to get access to plaintext (but not keys).  I generalized his
mathematics and published a paper in CACM (April 84).  The solution is to hash
messages before they are signed, which has other advantages anyway.  I also
remember various articles by people pointing other potential vulnerabilities
with RSA if the primes weren't picked right.

There are potential weaknesses in all of these public-key methods, but they
can be resolved.  As near as I can tell, NIST has resolved the potential
problems with the DSS, and I am confident that if new ones are found, they
will resolve them too.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Nautilus 1.0a Secure Phone Software
Keywords: telephone speech compression encryption


Announcing Nautilus 1.0: Secure Telephony on your Personal Computer
===================================================================

WHAT IS NAUTILUS?
- -----------------

Nautilus is a program that lets you have encrypted voice telephone
conversations with your friends without needing any special equipment.
Nautilus runs on IBM-PC compatible personal computers (386DX25 or
faster) under MSDOS or Linux as well as desktop Sun workstations
running SunOS or Solaris.  The MSDOS version requires a Soundblaster
compatible sound card while the Linux version can also support some
additional cards.  All versions need a high speed (9600 bps or faster)
modem to work.  The speech quality is pretty good at 14.4kbps and
acceptable at speeds as low as 7200 bps.  This means that Nautilus can
be used reasonably reliably over cellular phones, in good reception
areas.

Nautilus is the first program of this type that we know of to be
distributed for free with source code.  A few similar commercial
programs have been distributed without source, so that their security
cannot be independently examined.  Other free programs with source are
now beginning to appear.


GET IT WHILE YOU CAN
- --------------------

Certain parts of the US Government appear to be working to ban
civilian use of cryptography whose keys are not accessible to the
government.  Documents recently obtained from the FBI under the
Freedom of Information Act support this conclusion.  If programs like
Nautilus are made illegal, we will have to stop further development
and distribution.

We believe that the US Constitution entitles every citizen to use
secure communications that only he or she controls the keys to (see
the First and Fourth Amendments for more information).  So we urge
everybody to get a copy of Nautilus *now* and start using it.
Although we have many enhancements planned for future versions that
will make Nautilus better to use, the current version is already
reliable and provides everything necessary to protect your privacy
even if no further improvements are released.

For more info about the recently published FBI documents, see the
Electronic Privacy Information Center's web page on the subject at
http://www.epic.org/crypto/ban/fbi_dox/.


WHAT IS NEW IN THIS RELEASE?
- ----------------------------

We are pleased to announce that with this release, Nautilus is
officially out of beta test.  Nautilus has been through three public
beta test releases and been examined by several knowledgeable
cryptographers.  No catastrophic security bugs were found in any of
the beta releases, though some minor ones have been found and fixed.
Nautilus 1.0 has a few minor user interface and other improvements and
some non-security-related bug fixes compared to 0.9.2, but 0.9.2 has
been operating stably for several months and has needed *no* security
fixes.  Version 1.0 is entirely compatible with 0.9.2 and we have
deliberately postponed adding any new features that we feared might
introduce bugs.  Version 1.1 will have some interesting new features
including an automatic key exchange protocol that gives forward
secrecy and does not require secret passphrases.

While Nautilus still has had nowhere near the net-wide scrutiny of
email programs like PGP, its ciphers are well-tested and its protocols
are simple and robust.  We are now willing to place more confidence in
Nautilus's security than we would in any of the comparable programs
that we know of.  This is mostly because the other programs have not
withstood public scrutiny of their source code for as long (or at all).

New Feature Summary for Version 1.0:

    + Linux and Solaris support
    + Updated documentation
    + "Verbose mode" prints more info about Nautilus's operation
    + Enhanced 8500bps coder (improved audio quality)
    + Ability to change mic sensitivity from config file (see docs)
    + Ability to change output volume from config file (see docs)
    + Ability to set arbitrary com port addresses and IRQ's.
    + Automatically detects incompatible versions at the
      other end and tells you what is wrong (previous versions
      mysteriously just didn't work when the other end was
      incompatible).

The remainder of this announcement is similar to earlier Nautilus
announcements, so if you have already seen the earlier ones, just connect
to the nearest ftp site mentioned below to download the 1.0 release
of Nautilus.

HOW DOES NAUTILUS WORK?
- -----------------------

Nautilus uses your computer's audio hardware to digitize and play back
your speech using homebrew speech compression functions built into 
the program.  It encrypts the compressed speech using your choice of
the Blowfish, Triple DES, or IDEA block ciphers, and transmits the
encrypted packets over your modem to your friend's computer.  At the
other end, the process is reversed.  The program is half-duplex; just
hit a key to switch between talking and listening.

Nautilus's encryption key is generated from a shared secret passphrase
that you and your friend choose together ahead of time, perhaps via
email using PGP, RIPEM, or a similar program.  Nautilus itself does not
currently incorporate any form of public key cryptography.

Further details are in the documentation file included with the program.

FTP SITES
- ---------

Nautilus is available in three different formats:

nautilus-1.0a.tar.gz  - full source code
naut10a.zip           - MSDOS executable and associated documentation
naut10as.zip          - full source code

It is available at the following FTP sites:

It is also available at:

Colorado Catacombs BBS - (303) 772-1062

INTERNATIONAL USE
- -----------------

Sorry, but under current US law, Nautilus is legal for domestic use in
the US only.  We don't like this law but have to abide by it while it
is in effect.  Nautilus is distributed through export-restricted FTP
sites for this reason.  Export it at your own risk.

IMPORTANT
- ---------

Although we've done our best to choose secure ciphers and protocols
for Nautilus, and its design details have been reviewed by several
experts, it is still VERY EASY to make mistakes in such programs that
mess up the security.  It is still possible, though less likely than
before, that some security bugs remain.  We urge that users needing
very high security take an in-depth approach to protecting their
privacy.  See the Nautilus documentation file for more info.

As usual, we encourage cryptographers and users alike to examine and
test the program thoroughly, and *please* let us know if you find
anything wrong.  And as always, although we'll try to fix any bugs
reported to us, WE CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS.

CONTACTING THE DEVELOPERS
- -------------------------

The Nautilus development team is now made up of Bill Dorsey, Pat
Mullarky, Paul Rubin, Gil Spencer, and Andy Fingerhut.  To contact the
developers, send email to <nautilus@lila.com>.

This announcement, and the source and executable distribution files,
are all signed with the following PGP public key.  Please use it to
check the authenticity of the files and of any fixes we may post.  You
can also use it to send us encrypted email if you want.  We will try
to keep such email confidential, but cannot guarantee it.

APENDICE:
---------

Estes dois programas abaixo sao listagens destinadas a criacao do 
programa UUDECODE.COM, capaz de decodificar o arquivo PCX contido
na materia sobre tendinite. Se voce nao domina o basico de progra
-macao para conseguir fazer tais programas funcionar, sugiro  que
procure ajuda. Nao me responsabilizo pelo mal funcionamento   dos 
programas e/ou erros de qualquer especie. O programa UUDECODE.COM
e' comum em sistemas UNIX e esta' disponivel em qualquer ftp site
Mirror do simtel20 no subdiretorio simtel/msdos/starter. Por ex:

ftp://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/simtelnet/msdos/starter

Nao me enviem cartas perguntando sobre como fazer isso. Nao   vou 
responder

Boa sorte

/*
 * Modified 12 April 1990 by Mark Adler for use on MSDOS systems with
 * Microsoft C and Turbo C.
 *
 * Modifed 13 February 1991 by Greg Roelofs for use on VMS systems.  As
 * with the MS-DOS version, the setting of the file mode has been disabled.
 * Compile and link normally (but note that the shared-image link option
 * produces a binary only 6 blocks long, as opposed to the 137-block one
 * produced by an ordinary link).  To set up the VMS symbol to run the
 * program ("run uudecode filename" won't work), do:
 *              uudecode :== "$disk:[directory]uudecode.exe"
 * and don't forget the leading "$" or it still won't work.  The binaries
 * produced by this program are in VMS "stream-LF" format; this makes no
 * difference to VMS when running decoded executables, nor to VMS unzip,
 * but other programs such as zoo or arc may or may not require the file
 * to be "BILFed" (or "unBILFed" or whatever).  Also, unlike the other
 * flavors, VMS files don't get overwritten (a higher version is created).
 *
 * Modified 13 April 1991 by Gary Mussar to be forgiving of systems that
 * appear to be stripping trailing blanks.
