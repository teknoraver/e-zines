 Just when you were hoping that we were gone.. SMaK, here we are coming at
your monitor with a glaring sixth issue... just when you thought it was safe.
 Dubbed as the sell-out magazine of the year.. that's us.. immitated? yes,
pheared? yes, stopped? no.
 We didn't get a whole lot of submissions of ASCii art for this issue
(ok, none at all) so I'll bring it up one more time.. we need, for BoW 7,
your ascii depictions of the following:
     1) Mangled farm animals
     2) Mutilated Pets
     3) Squished Rodents
     4) Geeky SysAdmins
smak them to me via ish-mail to pluvius@io.org
 Scoping out six, it looks not to shabby.. we got some 0day programs for you
to try out (FooLZ, and a totally new idea - Codeline for Internet (that's
right, here's the software for you to run a codeline on internet!!)); we
have some exclusive insights to celebrity lives (no, not ErikB) - and my
favorite, we have a story for you to read to your girliez for bedtime
stories.. stay tuned for part two in the next issue.
 I don't have alot more to say.. if you wanna join BoW, read the article
in BoW 5, if you wanna find BoW sites, check the site list.. if you wanna
become a site, read the bit after the site list... but anyway, my warez
are getting stale, so I better go earn myself some file points.. so until
your sleeping and you think it is safe..

  BoW Magazine is an electronic magazine published whenever we feel like it,
  specializing in Computer Deviency, Software Piracy, Computer Insecurity,
  Telecommunications Fraud, and other nasty things. The longdistance carriers
  phear us.

  BoW Magazine is KopyWrong (K) 1994. Any unauthorized distribution is
  k-lame, and we will get Gail Thackory to traq you down, using her
  well seasoned HaQR-TRaQR abilities, as well as her alpha copy of HaQR-LoC,
  if you distribute these electrons without prior consent of God. God can be
  reached in New York City, on the subway. Grab a ride and ask him... then it
  will be ok. You can also distribute this magazine in an unauthorized fashion
  if either a) Your Girliez, or b) A Real Cyberpunk [in the event you do not
  have any Girliez] say it's ok. Real Cyberpunks can be reached at the
  following email addresses: idol@well.sf.ca.us, president@whitehouse.gov,
  root@att.att.com, and root@microsoft.com. If you don't have access to email,
  then call up a cyberpunk at the following phone number: 0. Ask them... but
  first ask them for some k0d3z, it's a secret codeline. Tell them you would
  like to distribute BoW magazine in an unauthorized fashion. They will be
  able to give you permission.

Submissions can be emailed to me, at pluvius@io.org, or can be uploaded
to our SUBMISSIONS BBS, Twilight of the Idols, see add at the end of this
issue. Alternately you can look for me on IRC, I have no life, I will
probably be there (check #BoW, #WaReZ666, #KoURiERZ, or #ZeR0DaY). A couple
of words on submissions: They must either be amusing, or related to either
hacking or phreaking, or preferably both - articals on computer security, or
telecommunications security are also welcome. No "I GOT YOUR INFO" submissions
please, and no more hate articals, they are not nice.

A FAIRLY MEDIUM AMOUNT, BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT OF CARRIER

w00p, since I rarely get email, and the few submissions I do get usually
end up getting printed in KGB... I figured I'd add in a letters to me section
to get everyone psyched and shit and sending me like fanmail, comments,
and other shit like that... so here's the one kewl letter I got this month..

[editors note: We would have loved to have given the DEWMED FELINE a
 better home, however, it passed away recently in a fatal candle lighting
 accident. Up until the moments of it's demise, it was purring happily,
 covered in butane (that stuff is flamible you know.. watch out) - how ever
 we do have some other household pets that are looking for a home... there
 is this small bunny rabbit.. it has a ferocious temper, and these big, sharp
 pointy teeth.... it goes straight for the neck... but as you can see,
 your submission 'NiN3T33N-NiNET33-PH0UR' appears in this BoW, and I don't
 know about everyone else, but I am quivering in anticipation wondering about
 the fate of our poor Billy]

	A sad day for the world of grunge has passed in early April with the
alleged suicide death of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Seattle grunge group
Nirvana.  It appeared so nice and tidy.  It was the storybook stereotypical
rock star suicide.  We`ve seen it before so the events and motives made sense 
to us, almost TOO much sense.  Well all of us here at BoW knew something stunk 
and we put our heads together to get to the bottom of thiz mess.  You won't
believe what we found.

	During the weeks following the death of Kurt Cobain BoW's most talented
collection of haqrs spent their dayz and nights exploring the internet,
searching for truth.  What we found startled us, and is sure to send chillz up
the spines of every cyberpunk on the globe.  Kurt Cobain is still alive and 
more shockingly, he's a haqr!  We will present you with overwhelming evidence,
including actual logs of our voyages throughout the net in search of the real
truth and possibly more significantly, a search for ourselves.  I`m sure that
after you carefully and objectively review the following material you will 
share the opinion that Kurt Cobain is indeed a ueberhacker and is far from 
deceased.

	Well there you have it friends.  Kurt Cobain iz indeed alive and he's
quite a proficient haqr.  You have seen everything that we saw during that 
fateful day of April 9, 1994.  And so we leave the facts in front of you to
decide for yourself, should you have any doubt.  We seek to manipulate no one
at BoW.  We simply report the truth, pure and untarnished.  Of course truth iz
a relative term and can be a bit distorted in the minds of the insane but hey..
in a world with so little truth anymore, we can't afford to be nitpicky.  We 
hope to keep you updated on the new life of Kurt Cobain.  Note that we changed
all of hiz real inpho to protect hiz privacy.  Until next time...


                        Phear the truth.  Phear BoW.

==============================================================================

    He ground out the last of his filter-tipped Gauloises in
  the overflowing ashtray on the marble table. His hands
  were slightly trembling. He glanced at his rolex - 7:00pm.
  Seven o' clock, and she was not back from school yet. Was
  she hanging out with those low-life kids again? Was she
  sitting in some fancy Munich pub swallowing loads of
  Hacker-Pschorr, with those punks across the table just
  waiting for her to get drunk enough so they could... The
  though alone was frighting, let alone the probability of
  the thing. He was scared, not nervous, but maybe a little
  of both. When the oak clock in the corner started banging
  out it's usual hourly song, he seriously shrugged.

    He snatched a new pack of Gauloises from his desk
  drawer, lit one up and reached for the cordless.

    Click. Kerchunk. Buzz. Over the steady hum of the
  dialtone he got to think about where he would be calling.
  The school. Yes, that'd be a good idea. He took a drag of
  his cigarette, and until the stakkato of the speed dialer
  was through, this one was also crushed in the little
  silver tray on his desk. Ring once. Ring twice. Come on.
  Heavens, the secretary was still in. His daughter's class
  teacher, Ms. Veefast, also was.

    "This is Bill Gates. Sorry to pester you, but do you know
    if my Keronda's still on the campus?"

    "She left about two hours ago, why?"

    "I'm just concerned. She didn't arrive at home yet. Did
    you see her leave yourself?"

    "Sure did. In her white camaro, about ten to five."

    "All right, thanks."

    "You're welcome. There's nothing wrong there, is it?"

    "Sure isn't. Have a nice day."

    He hung up. What the hell? She could at least call if
  she'd be coming home later. Maybe he just missed the call,
  because he did not have call waiting. What if she tried to
  call in the very minute he was calling the school? Shit.
  Maybe he was just paranoid without a cause, but, somehow,
  something deep inside his bowels was telling him that he
  wasn't. This happened two, three times before, but he
  never noticed a nagging feeling like this.

    The moment he flung out his nicotine-stained hands at
  the pack for another cigarette was the one the phone
  chimed gently.

    He ripped it off the base and hastily squeezed the talk
  button. The smokestick hit the fone, leaving a spot of
  slightly melted plastic right next to the receiver. The
  glow flinged away and burned its way through the carpet,
  an expensive one, but he didn't seem to care too much.

    "Hello?"

    Nothing.

    "Hello?"

    Line noise.

    "Hel-"

    "We got your daughter."

    "Wha-"

    "You better just listen, and nobody's gonna get hurt. If
  you want to see her again in one piece, you better
  listen real carefully, ok?"

    His hands were now shaken by tremors of various
  undefinable chemical reactions going on in his brain at
  that very moment. Like that feeling you have as a kid when
  you're sitting on the bus with no ticket, and you see the
  ticket checkers getting on. It was a deep emotion of
  panic.

    "'kay!"

    "Awright. The only thing we want in exchange is warez.
  Make sure it's new ones, zero day, and only small files.
  You dig?"

    He managed to squeal a "Ye'h."

    "Fine. Two gigs. We want two gigs. Put 'em on a scsi
  drive, a used fujitsu one. Remember, zero day, small

  deceive us, don't try to give us old warez, or that little
  sunshine will never call the Elusive Dream again. Razors can
  do such nasty things to little girlie'z fingerz. After you're

  himself together not to slam it against the wall.

    Where was he going to get two gigz in small filez? Who

  ever see her again, alive, with all her fingers?

1) iNtR0|)uC+i0n (remember this was 'introduction')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are a few questions and answers to the reasons for writing this guide...

w|-|0 i$ I+ AiM3|) A+?
Translation : Who is it aimed at?
It is aimed at most unkewl lamers such as yourself and definitely includes you
NSA, FBi, Scotland Yard types... :)

yEaH i kN0w tHa+! |)u|-|! |3uT h0W |)0 I gRaB tH3 pASsw|) fIL3 c0z i'M
s0 LaM3 i d0N't kN0w h0W?
Translation : Yeah I know that! Duh! But how do I grab the passwd file
coz I so lame I don't know how?

Mmm, I recommended that you read my guide which is coming out in the
near future called 'The guide to obtaining the passwd file'.

wHy aM i $0 $a|)?
Translation : Why am I so sad?

Ah yes another of my soon to be releashed guides 'How to prevent lameness
for good mental health and profit'.

2) |3a$ic pHrA$e$ (Basic Phrases)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
h0w t0 gR33t 3VeRy 0nE wH3n y00 eNteR aN 'eYe aR3 s33' cHanN3L
Translation : How to greet every one when you enter an 'IRC' channel

i) y0y0y0y0y0y0y0

alternatively...

ii) aWp mUh pHuQn AsS n0W...eYe aM pHr0M BoW, cOweR aNd PheAr mE...

Analysis of the following phrases:
i) Ah ha..yes this is a safe and neutral attempt at not getting BK'd, Gargoyled
   etc.. However if you tried this, then add on the following line...

   wHy iZ #wAreZ aLwayZ inVite 0nLy?
   or
   hEy y00 gUyZ giMMe yEr npH0...

   You had better say good bye to #phreak for afew hours...

ii) Now under no circumstance should this be attempted by an unskilled aYcH/peE
    d00d.. As sayin" the following could be extremely bad for you health.

3) a|)vAnC3d pHra$3$    (Advanced Phrases)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Warning!*
The following information is strictly for 'k-SpiFFy KeWL aYch/Pee d00Dz' under
no circumstance should this be tried without previously readin" the 'Basic
Phrases' section, and muh other guide "eYe aRe Cee sUrVivaL kiT".
You have been warned...

As an added safety measure I have switched to k-Rad speak to protects the
innocent who may by accident glance on this part of the article..i.e. poor
dewmd kitties, young #Warez type kiddies, local law enforcement agencies.

==============================================================================

 Due to the enormous amount of positive response from our previous 'How to'
article (see the article 'How to become a phamous aych-pee d00d' in BoW #3)
we have decided to release yet another 'How to' artical, this one a bit 
more extensive. In this article, we will show you how to become an all
around famous computer underground d00d... if you follow the steps below,
soon people will be writing books about you, and you will join the legion
of famous aych-pee d00dz like Knight Lightening, Len Rose, Kevin Mitnick, Kevin
Poulson...  the list goes on.. 
 So in this article, we will teach you how to become a phamous Warez dude,
as well as a phamous H/P/V/A/C d00d. You will get all the girlies, have books
written about you, you will make the covers of weekly magazines, and you will
get to share a jail cell with Phiber Optic..

Step 1 - Research

Ok, this is one of the hardest steps, because you have to like read books..
smak yourself a copy of 'The Hacker Crackdown' and read all about The Legion
of Doom and Phrack, grab yourself a copy of Cyberpunk and read all about
Kevin Mitnick, RTM, and those german guys... also see if you can get
your grubby hands on all the back issues of phrack, a copy of Out of the
Inner Circle, and The Cuckoos Egg... grab yourself a copy of all the
TV Specials on Hackers... and see if you can get a copy of the UK special
"Walk on the Wild Side"... finally grab a subscription to 2600 and
get all the back issues you can... read all these so thay you know what you
can expect when a book get's written about you when you become a phamous
computer underground d00d.

Step 2 - Become a phamous C d00d

Now this step is pretty much a no-brainer... there are only a few things
that you need:
  i) a valid credit card and expiry date
  ii) an item to purchase ('card')
  iii) (optional) a drop box

Now there are many ways to obtain a valid card, the best, and most sure way,
is obtaining one from fellow comptuer d00dz... the best kind of card to
have is one that alot of people know about, because if alot of people have it,
it must be a pretty good one.... so start to read message areas on H/P/V/A/C
BBSes, preferably network areas (because more people will have the cards posted
there, therefore they must be better cards)... try also codelines, conferences,
IRC, or best of all, USENET (because much more people read USENET than anything
else, so the very best cards will be posted there..) if you don't see people
posting cards on USENET, you might want to coax some out by posting cards 
there yourself.. if you have your own credit card, post it, or if not, your
mother or fathers cards... people will see these, and realize that USENET 
is the best place to post cards, so they will loosen up and post all their
cards.. and these ones will be the very best, because of the wide distribution
of USENET.
   Now you have yourself a valid card and expirary date, you fave to find
something you want... since it's free, you may as well splurge... things
like complete computer systems, cars, houses, boats, sterios.. these are
all great things to have, and you will become quite famous because of 
all your fabulous wealth... so once you have decided what you want to card,
find a suitible store that sells such items.. make sure that this store
accepts the kind of card you have... otherwise you will be hard pressed 
trying to card the item.... now choose a good time to go to the store..
the best times are times when they are not busy, as they will beable to 
give you their full attention, so you will be able to get out of there quicker.
   Now pick out the item you want to 'card'... it doesn't matter if you
act nervous or anything like that, because you are spending alot of money,
and the store clerks expect people who are making large purchases to ack
wierd... maybe twitch every now and then for good luck - try not to look 
the clerk in the eye either.. this way he won't remember you at all..
   Once you have choosen your item to 'card', tell the clerk you would like
to put it on your credit card... they will take your card (if you only have
the numbers, tell them that you just had your wallet stolen, and only have your
card number, not the actual card.. they will accept this.. so no worries),
they will then punch your card into a little computer thing (these things 
are pretty fancy and complicated.. so we won't bother trying to explain them,
because we haven't really figured out that they are yet... we think they have
some kind of little magical crystal ball in them which checks your card.. but
i dunno) and will check for authorization... now since you are getting an
expensive item, the computer authorization will probably choke.. this is no
big deal... tell the clerk that your card is fine, and authorized for the
purchase, and ask them to call and make a verbal confirmation of the 
purchase... wait for them to do this, and then you will be all set... once
the purchase is rang through, thank the clerk, and take your new toy(s) home.
Once it is all rang through, you might want to taunt the clerk, tell them
that it wasn't your card.. make fun of them for being so stupid.. they
can't do anything, since the card is already rung through, so say what you
like to them.... enjoy yourself,.... you are now a very krad 'C' d00d. rejoice.


Step 3 - Become a phamous A d00d

Like becoming a phamous C d00d, this one is also a no brainer... infact,
to become a phamous A d00d, no brains is a prerequisite.
Now to become a phamous 'A' d00d, you have to do a bit of reading again..
I know it is not fun, but glory and phame do not come easily.. you much work
a bit at it... leach yourself a copy of as many anarchy files as you can
get your hands on and read every one of them you can... the best kind are
on genetic warfare, nuclear weapons, genocide.. interesting things like this.
Now most of them contain steps on how to build some kind of explosive device
(a thing that goes 'BOOM'), choose a device you would like to build, and get
to it... most files also point out where the necessary items can be
obtained.. simply follow the directions.. You may want to start of with some
of the easier ones and work your way up... check out BoW's 'A' group; ANuS.. 
some of their articles appear in BoW #5. Now once you have constructed
a powerfull exposive device, you must choose target that will attract world
wide attention when it goes 'BOOM' (with all the world wide attention, you
will surely become a phamous A d00d), some targets to consider are:
   - the Pentagon
   - the Kremlin
   - the Whitehouse
   - your local Parliament buildings (if you live in a country with 
     representative democracy)
   - your local Dictators place of residence (if you live in a country with
     a military dictatorship)
   - your King and/or Queens palace (if you live in a country with a monarchy)
   - a near by nuclear missle silo
   - the nearest US embasy (sure to grab yourself alot of attention)

Now once you have chosen a suitable target for your 'BOOM', go to it...
the best time is in the day, so that you don't have to mess around with 
flash lights, and nasty stuff like that... choose a nice sunny day,
and just walk right up to the target location carrying your explosive,
plany the explosive, and run like hell... it will not be long before you
are a world phamous A d00d. In the rare case that you fail the first time,
try again... (you know that saying...)

Step 4 - Become a phamous V d00d

Now to become a phamous V d00d... this is a sticky area, because there
are many very talented virus writers, however.. to become a phamous one,
you don't need any talent.. so have no phear, you can become a phamous V 
d00d too... now smak yourself a copy of VCL (virus creation labs) and follow
it's easy instructions... create a virus that infects all the files it 
can, and have it set to go off on Presidents day... make it have a nasty 
message like 'beware Clinton.. we're coming for you' or something like that
that will attract alot of attention.. now find a popular game (something like
Doom or similar) and infect it with your virus, and upload it everywhere you
can... then write to all the computer magazines you can warning about your
virus (give it some scary name, so it will attract attention on the cover
of daily tabloids and weekly magazines.. something like 'the killer k0d3', or
'death by chineese torture', or 'the necrophelia virus'.. something that
you like, after all it is your virus..).. soon the world will be in panic,
you will be a phamous 'V' d00d...

Step 5 - Become a phamous P d00d

 Now on to the slightly more challenging letters...  as you may have noticed,
most of the really phamous P d00ds have the first name Kevin (mitnick, poulson
etc.) so your first step to becoming a phamous P d00d is to change your first
name to Kevin (ie: if your name is Vern Radbourne, you would change your
name to Kevin Radbourne - (note, this would be a very elite name, it can be
shortened to K.Rad)). Once your name is legally changed, you may procede to 
the next step. Call all the H/P/V/A/C BBSes, and look for programs like 
"HACKPBX.EXE", "HACKVMB.EXE", "PHREAK.EXE".. down load all of these... 
two programs you must get are ToneLoc and Codetheif... now play with the
other programs you got, to get a feel for being a P d00d, then once you
feel confident enough, fireup toneloc... now you want to skan out some 
PBX's so that you can get codes, and be a phamous P d00d, after all, all
P d00ds have k0d3z... even the lame ones.. set Toneloc to scan 1-800-XXX-XXXX,
and leave it running for as long as possible.. atleast until it picks up a few
PBX's for you to hack... now once you have found a PBX (a PBX is a number you
call and instead of giving you a person to talk to, gives you a sound like
a dial tone... ) you need to hack yourself a code. So grab your copy of
code thief, and let it run wild... 

NOTE: 800's are the best to scan, because they have ANI.. (see BoW 3 for
      acronym expansions), you can optionally scan local prefixes.. but this 
      is not as fun, as you will miss out on fun call backs by operators, and 
      toll fraud investigators..

Now if you let code-theif run long enough, you will end up with some valid codes
for your PBX... once you have the PBX and valid codes, it is time to get 
phamous... you must give this PBX to as many people as possible to make it
a good PBX (note: PBXs, like credit cards, are better if more people have them)
distribute the PBX and code to all the code-lines you know of, all the 
BBSes (preferably ones on nets) that you call, and most importantly, on USENET.
Continue doing this for a few months, everyone will thank you for giving them
codes, and they will love you. You will be phamous.
Now being a phamous P d00d is not necessarily restricted to PBXs.. on to the
next rung in the ladder on elite P-dom... Calling Cards... now calling cards
are like credit cards... except that you use them to make phone calls rather
than buy stuff... now calling cards can be obtained in the same method as
credit cards... notibly code-lines and USENET.. also hang out at airport or 
bus station payphones, and if you see someone using a calling card, go over
and beat them up and take it.. now the nice thing about calling cards is that
they are entirely untracable... so it is 100% safe to use it as much as you
like of your own phone line.. so go crazy... call up your new found P 
friends (from code-lines) overseas... call as much as you like, after all,
you are a P-d00d.. once you have mastered the art of calling card abuse,
it's time to move on... blue boxing... all the cool kids do it, so grab your
self a copy of Bluebeep, and some tfiles on blue boxing... remember, you
must blow a clear and loud 2600 down your line to sieze.. remember this,
and you are all set.. boast alot to all your new found friends about your
exploits.. this will make you even more of a phamous P d00d....

Step 6 - Become a phamous H d00d

Now that you have become a phamous P dude, it is time to move on to the
final letter in the alphabet series of computer crime... yes, 'H'.
To become a famous H dude, you need to get lots of scripts.. (not
irc scripts, but shell scripts.. smak yourself a copy of a basic unix
manual if you are not clear on what a shell script is)... once you have
yourself lots of scripts, use your scripts to get the passwd file, as getting
the passwd file is what H is all about.. once you have a passwd file, you
can trade with your new found P and C friends.. post on USENET, post
on codelines (note: posting passwd files on codelines takes a long time,
but it is worth it).. once you have lots of passwd files, leach yourself
a password cracker of some kind.. crackerjack perhaps.. and run this for
a bit when you aren't running PHREAK.EXE or HACK.EXE... when you have alot
of passwd files cracked, you will have accounts all over the place.. trade
some of these accounts for more scripts, and with your new scripts get more
passwd files... the circle goes on, and very soon you will be a phamous H
dude as well.


Step 7 - Become a phamous Warez d00d

Simple, join BoW.
