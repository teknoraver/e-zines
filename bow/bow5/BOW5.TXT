 WoW WoW WoW WoW, 'ere be BoW #5. After much hate mail, and narc attempts, we
are still alive (barely).... there's been a bit of a wait since BoW #4, but
too bad for y00. We had alot of negative feedback on #4, but fortunately
a few people gave us some real praise, and a will to go on... we
thank those people from the bottom of our code-books.

<Proff> That BoW magazine iwthteh *worst* rubbish I've seen in a long time
<Proff> Looks like it was written by 10 demented 13 yearolds.
> mind if I quote you on that?
<Proff> Nope.

 10 demented 13 year olds? How generous! And to think I was starting to get
dis-heartened! Now I have the will to go on forever!
 The last issue was a bit large, so we have decided to trim down the
newsletters a bit... keep them within reasonable size, so as not to have
to couriers tie up their lines for too long... we do not wish to impede
the progress of zero day rdist exploits, sendmail DEBUG exploits, or other
eleet aych pee warez.
 I hope that you enjoy BoW #5. If you wish to contribute, do not hesitate
to send hate mail, death threats, or BoW submissions to my email address
(provided below). That's about it for now.... and remember, it's better
to fade away than have a hole in your head.

 NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE: Due to some of our hard core fans being a bit obsessed
with us (they sometimes like to clean up our accounts file space, and
read our mail for us) it is requested that all email to us be PGP encrypted.
My PGP key follows, please us it when sending mail. In addition, all further
newsletters will be PGP signed, as there have been alot of partially edited
news letters circulating, as well as copies that are missing certain articals,
or every 10 lines or interesting other cyberspace anomilies.

  BoW Magazine is an electronic magazine published whenever we feel like it,
  specializing in Computer Deviency, Software Piracy, Computer Insecurity,
  Telecommunications Fraud, and other nasty things. The telcos phear us.

  BoW Magazine is KopyWrong (K) 1994. Any unauthorized distribution is
  not krad, and we will get Cliff Stole to track you down, using his
  Very Krad(tm) hacker-tracker paging equipment, in addition to his
  alpha copy of HaQR-LoC, if you distribute these electrons without prior
  consent of God. God can be reached in New York City, at the brothels.
  Drop by and ask him... then it will be ok. You can also distribute this
  magazine in an unauthorized fashion if either a) Your Kid Sister, or b) A
  Real Cyberpunk [in the event you do not have a Kid Sister] say it's ok.
  Real Cyberpunks can be reached at the following email addresses:
  idol@well.sf.ca.us, president@whitehouse.gov, root@cert.org, and
  root@wired.com. If you don't have access to email, then call up a cyberpunk
  at the following phone number: 911. Ask them... they will ask you your name,
  and the nature of your emergency. Tell them you would like to distribute BoW
  magazine in an unauthorized fashion. They will be able to give you
  permission.

Submissions can be emailed to me, at pluvius@io.org, or can be uploaded
to our SUBMISSIONS BBS, Twilight of the Idols, see add at the end of this
issue. Alternately you can look for me on IRC, I have no life, I will
probably be there. A couple of words on submissions: They must either be
amusing, or related to either hacking or phreaking, or preferably both
- articals on computer security, or telecommunications security are also
welcome. No "I GOT YOUR INFO" submissions please, and no more hate articals,
they are not nice.

NOT MUCH CARRIER

==============================================================================

    Her maidenhead bursts, the virgin has been torn tenderly from the age
    of innnocence and she bleeds illumination through every pore of her
    body.  She feels the helplessess of spirit trapped in it's mortal coil,
    she bares it's pain as it gazes from the eyes like a prisoner from its
    cell window.  Transcendence..  Stigmata.....  She has experienced BoW
    and found solace...

                             THERE ARE OTHERS
                              U R N0T Al0n3

                          The BrotherHood Awaits...

    How to apply:
    *()**()**()*

        Applications to BoW are made informally by way of submitting
        articles for upcoming releases.  Release dates are the 1st of
        every month and if we use your article then you automatically
        become one of the kewl kidz..  You become BoW...


    Articles:
    *()**()*

        While BoW does not adhere to any guideline when evaluating
        submissions, we do ask that you observe the following:

            1) Lame "I've got your info" articles will not be
               released.  The unauthorized release of #2 is a
               good example of this sort of stupidity and will
               not be tolerated in any way, shape or form.

            2) Do not send us k0d3z, password files or any
               form of deviant inph()...  We phear HaQr'z and
               will not print such evil.

            3) Each submission should include a .gif of your
               g1rl13'z and/or m0ther...  Ascii depictions of
               farm animals doing weird things are also acceptable.


    Once You Are a Member:
    *-()*()*()*()*()*()-*

        Once you have been accepted as a BoW member, your only
        requirement to maintain membership is participation:

            - each member must submit at least once every
              second issue...

    Support Sites:
    *()*()*()*()*

        If you are a sysop and feel that BoW is worthy of your HD
        space, you can become an official BoW 1nph0rmat10n s00pah-
        h1ghwaY m3mbah by either contacting pluvius or myself on
        irc or by mailing interest to:

Oh no! Eye phear! Kids with scripts get BoW! Help! Help! They were too elite
to notice the TCP wrappers, or even erase their wtmp entries! (note the
blanked wtmp entry.. half way there guys, try harder next time!) They even
left logs of them running rdist -Server, they must be elite to have gotten
the secretive 8lgm advisories. Eye phear them. I lie awake in bed at night
cowering in phear. Included below the log is a step by step guide on
how you too can become an eubercracker with scripts!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the steps to becoming a uebercracker.

Step 1. Relax and remain calm. Remember YOU are a Uebercracker.

Step 2. If you know a little Unix, you are way ahead of the crowd and skip
        past step 3.

Step 3. You may want to buy Unix manual or book to let you know what
        ls,cd,cat does.

Step 4. Read Usenet for the following groups: alt.irc, alt.security,
        comp.security.unix.  Subscribe to Phrack@well.sf.ca.us to get a
        background in uebercracker culture.

Step 5. Ask on alt.irc how to get and compile the latest IRC client and
        connect to IRC.

Step 6. Once on IRC, join the #hack channel. (Whew, you are half-way
        there!)

Step 7. Now, sit on #hack and send messages to everyone in the channel
        saying "Hi, What's up?". Be obnoxious to anyone else that joins
        and asks questions like "Why cant I join #warez?"

Step 8. (Important Step) Send private messages to everyone asking for new
        bugs or holes. Here's a good pointer, look around your system for
        binary programs suid root (look in Unix manual from step 3 if confused).
        After finding a suid root binary, (ie. su, chfn, syslog), tell people
        you have a new bug in that program and you wrote a script for it.  If
        they ask how it works, tell them they are "layme". Remember, YOU are a
        UeberCracker. Ask them to trade for their get-root scripts.

Step 9. Make them send you some scripts before you send some garbage file
        (ie. a big core file). Tell them it is encrypted or it was messed
        up and you need to upload your script again.

Step 10. Spend a week grabbing all the scripts you can. (Don't forget to be
         obnoxious on #hack otherwise people will look down on you and not
         give you anything.)

Step 11. Hopefully you will now have at least one or two scripts that get
         you root on most Unixes. Grab root on your local machines, read
         your admin's mail, or even other user's mail, even rm log files and
         whatever temps you. (look in Unix manual from step 3 if confused).

Step 12. A good test for true uebercrackerness is to be able to fake mail.
         Ask other uebercrackers how to fake mail (because they have had to
         pass the same test). Email your admin how "layme" he is and how you
         got root and how you erased his files, and have it appear coming from
         satan@evil.com.

Step 13. Now, to pass into supreme eliteness of uebercrackerness, you brag
         about your exploits on #hack to everyone. (Make up stuff, Remember,
         YOU are a uebercracker.)

Step 14. Wait a few months and have all your notes, etc ready in your room
         for when the FBI, Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies
         confiscate your equipment. Call eff.org to complain how you were
         innocent and how you accidently gotten someone else's account and
         only looked because you were curious. (Whatever else that may help,
         throw at them.)

Step 15. Now for the true final supreme eliteness of all uebercrackers, you
         go back to #hack and brag about how you were busted.  YOU are finally
         a true Uebercracker.

Introduction
............

This plan is to be distributed among the most elite of the wares community
in the world (and France).  As you might have noticed, a lot of people
do not take kindly to our wares.  They make fun of us, they annoy us,
THEY PISS ME OFF, they use their illegitimately gained techno-knowledge
to wreck havoc on the net-community (read that in a book heh... not sure
about the spelling tho).  Just last night someone applied to my board
looking for info... again!  Obviously someone is hacking... uh... cracking
the NUP.  Anyhow, it's time we fucking fought back.  I seriously think
that the pirate world has grown.  We have a place in the computer underground
and I don't mean an IRC channel!  We have government agencies against
us (dammit!).  S0 D3Y WR1T3 L1K3 D1Z.  Ha ha.  No one writes like this
coz if they do they look lame!  And they don't get validated!  So occasionaly
a 'Z' gets in there somewhere.  Big deal!

I was talking with some coders last night, since they quit their group
and were looking to join mine but they tried to ditch the $50 donation
hah that's some fucking joke it's not as if they are too elite for me
or anything they didn't even gimme sources to see what their shit was
worth and skipped some lines in my application file but they thought
that since they got the old prez pissed they could score good points with
me well GUESS AGAIN JOEY heh now he will probably rag on me on Ding-A-Ling
for using his real name hahahahahah good one narq so anyway we agreed on
$25 and some orios but that's not what I was talking about.  They
said that since some pirates can program too - which reminds me I put
my .BAT file for passwording my computer against my piss ant brother for
ftp and dcc and http and gopher and www and tcp and udp and nfs and rpc
and lots more.  Well anyway we can fuck them too.  Actually joey (narq!!)
suggested calling up 911 and giving their info but I told him no since
A: we aint got no info (i don't like that w0rd) and B: 911 has ANI!
(I also don't like talking to people... it's scary.  I get all red).

So we decided to search the internet and kick some ass.  ANALyst said
we should break into Tymnet and monitor passwords but I wasn't sure
what that meant so I told him to shut up and kicked him off the conference.
(Which is why Ill be leaving the scene for a while since my calling
card supply has suddenly run dry).  Anyway, we got some interesting shit.

The plan comes to this: we got the info, we are the world.  The old
hackers can go scroo each other.  Wait and see.

This file is being constantly updated.  Get this shit, read it
(it's not much complicated than an .nfo) and use it.  Just do it.  I
put the stuff real nice in here.

1.  Information Sources

Pigpuss reports:  I was scanning FTPs some day for cool stuff when I
came upon a wide open system.  I'll cut a long story short but I got
the 411 on lots of cool stuff about security and shit.  I'll sum it
up cause it's big and complicated like.  You know the Internet (that's
where IRC is).  Well it's possible to get into other systems on the
internet (that's called telnet -> telephone + internet).  But you
can go into systems that aren't yours.  Well that's illegal (like pirating
but not so bad) and there are some groups that deal with that.  First
there is USENET where there are many cops and they catch hackers and
they trade porn stuff (kinda like Rusty 'n' Eddy but smaller).  Then
there are HP groups, but not lamer groups like on IRC but elite groups.
They find security holes (or "bombs") and spread them all around the Net for
anyone to abuse!  Anarchy Rules!  SEX PISTOLZ!!  So there is CERT, and
CIAC, and FIRST.  Well CERT is the best cause they made really detailed
shit (more on that later).  CIAC is like a little CERT (you know like the
THG -> USA split but that's old hat) and FIRST sucks, but they have many
international HQs.  Mo' next time.

1.1  Bombs

Fuckin' Hacker reports:  'Puss passed the CERT info to me since I'm
the best painter in the group, and I digged some really cool ANSiS for
them (like the great big "thanks to Gene Spafford" one!).  But I scanned
the files and I learned the bombs, and I'll give a short list here.  Short
cause I don't want no lamers to format systems!?!

One of the files talked about a /dev/audio hole... well if there's one
thing I know it's audio!  We are not working on some MODs that will
kick UNiX apart.  Might come with a VGA or not, depends on how much time
I have.

Next, there are unpassworded accounts.  What this means is that if you
log on a system and type in an account and it doesn't ask for a password,
that account is unpassworded and you're in!  It's difficult to find them
(sysadms scan for ppl who are accessing the password files and they
are protected) but if you do... you're in luck!  Try sync.  It worked
some places but I'll have to see it to believe it.

2.  Security News

Back to Ol' T0M:  Dudes, get this: some guy just crashed the internet!
Wow!  I remember I had problem crashing ViSiON-X a while back... shit.
It's like this.  He is the kid of a guy from the CIA, and he wrote a program
that goes from machine to machine and crashes the machine!!  The whole
internet is collapsing.  I read a file about it just a couple of minutes
ago.  That program is a virus but I checked and it wasn't in no virus
mag.  More info on this as it comes in.


3.  Self-Security News

I think it's important to encrypt stuff.  So call up my BBS and download
PGP (Pirates Give Parties... just a wild name I came up with after
finishing that bitchin' program).  It's pretty complicated so you'll have
to read the docs.  Use it.

4.  That's all for NOW.  The next issue will be better.  Stay tuned,
and remember, if you don't contribute or are not elite - you're out!

             THIS YER AGREEING TO NOT SUE ME AND STUFF...



                     ======================================================

           (" "
            )


    ONE OF MY FAVOURiTE METHODZ OF KAT EXTERMINTATION IS A PLAY ON THE
    OLD HOCKEY KARD IN THE SPOKES OF YER BICYCLE TO MAKE A KEWL SOUND
    THING, IF YEW HAVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE WHAT ESSENTIALLY YOU DO
    IS AFFIX A HOCKEY KARD TO YER SPOKES AND AS YOU PEDAL IT MAKES A
    KEWL KLICKING SOUND..  WELL THIS IZ FOR PANZIE FAGGOTZ #@!@  IF YER
    KEWL WHAT YEW DO IZ TAKE A LiVE KAT aND AFFIX IT TO THE SPOKES OF
    YER BIKE AND PEDAL AROUND TOWN VIGOROUSLY, NOT ONLY DOEZ IT SOUND
    KEWL BUT ALSO YOU GET SUM CHOICE LOOKZ FROM ANYONE YOU HAPPEN TO
    PASS BY !@#@!

    [NoTe: Thiz method will not work on bikes without spokes,
    ie: big wheels, if you own a big wheel: get some skipping
    rope and tie one end to the kat and the other end to the back of
    your big wheel, position yourself at the top of a big hill and
    pedal downward vigorously]


    ANOTHER FAVOURITE OF MINE REQUIREZ ACCESS TO YER SCIENCE TEACHERS
    STOREROOM OR SOMEPLACE WHERE YOU KAN AQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PURE
    POTASSIUM.  BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO IS SHOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PURE
    POTASSIUM DOWN THE CATS THROAT AND THEN ONCE IT IS SUFFICIENTLY
    STUFFED WHIP IT INTO THE BATHTUB WHEN YER MOTHER IS HAViNG A BATH
    OR EVEN INTO A PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL.  YOU WILL REVEL IN THE XPLOSION
    OF KAT FUR AND INTESTINES THAT WILL RESULT FROM SUCH ELEETNEZZ..
    IN KASE YOU DONT KNOW, POTASSIUM + h2o (water) kauses a minor xplosion.
    THE MORE PURE POTASSIUM YEW STUFF THE KAT WITH THE BETTER THE BOOM.

    [NoTe: Another play on this method iz to stuff the kat with the
    potassium and then remark to your mom that the kat looks like it
    needz a bath, when yer mom immerses the kat in water *B00M*.. hehe
    If you want to be elaborate, talk to your mom alot about spontaneous
    combustion, fill her head with lotz of horror stories about it then
    proceed with the plan...  it will take her weekz to recover from
    the shock when FeFe goez BooM-BooM]
    [NoTe#2: ThiZ meth0d iz loadz of fun when you employ one of th0se
    panzie 'throw in yer quarterz' publik fountainz as yer detonator]

[3] THE KHEMiKAL KAT:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        MATERiALZ YEW WiLL NEED:
        =======================

            - hallucinogenic substance (preferably LSD-25 or a derivative
                                        thereof)
            - one kat (see appendix A)

            - ample supply of floor wax

            - tacks (or any sharp objects will do)

            - strobelight

            - flourescent paint (various kolours)

            - small ball or kats toy

        Directionz:
        ==========

            - locate within your house a large area with wooden or vinyl
              flooring (carpeted floorz will not work in this case)
            - wax it thouroughly with generic or industrial floor wax,
              try to bring it to a state with a high slip factor..
            - kover the area with sharp objects, include whatever other
              barriers and obstacles which you find amusing...
            - remove all light sources, cover any windows, etc....
            - rig the strobelight up so that its pulse will illuminate
              the waxed flooring area.
            - apply the flourescent paint to the kat to produce a tye-dye
              effect or suit to taste... let the kat sit until it is dry..
            - ingest the lsd while you are waiting for the kat to dry..

        Once you are sufficiently under the influence of the acid, turn on
        the strobe light to desired pulse level and toss the psychadelik
        kat into the middle of the waxed floor..  The ruckus that will result
        will sufficiently amuse you whilst you are tripping and cause much
        frustration and woe on the part of the kat..  Taunt the kat by throwing
        balls across the room or any other cat toy, etc... The ambiance kan
        also be enhanced by the inclusion of loud music or sound effect record
        cranked to optimum volume...
        Also if you want to include a friend , you kan turn it into a neat game
        by including of course: another hit of acid (to be ingested by friend)
        and two squirt guns, try and see who kan hit the kat the most times..
        It kan bekum a fast paced drinking game if you enhance the rules of the
        game to be for every time you miss the kat, you take one drink..
        simple enuff... (of course given the mindset u will be in as a result
        of the acid it may prove difficult to keep a proper tally)..


[4] PORCELiN PUSSY PHURY:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        MATERiALZ YEW WiLL NEED:
        =======================

            - one kat (see Appendix A)

            - one porcelin toilet

            - industrial or generic strength toilet bowl
              kleaning agent.  (the more the merrier)

            - assorted other cleaning agents i.e: Drano or
              ammonia agent.

            - "1000 Flushes" <-- Commercially available toilet
                                 cleaning agent..

        DiREKTiONZ:
        ==========

            - pour the entire amount of toilet kleaning agent
              genorously into toilet bowel.
            - mix in any other cleaning agents you deem appropriate
              at this time..
            - install the 1000 flushes unit..
            - place kat in bowel
            - close lid
            - flush
            - run like hell (get tha phuck outta there)

        The resultant explosion caused by mixing of these cleaning
        agents should be suitably enough to incite panic and much
        distress in yer parental unitz.  Revel in yer parents discomfort
        as they attempt to seperate whats left of FeFe from the bitz of
        porcelain scattered throughout..  This method kan be optionally
        enhanced by the inclusion of a strobelight and a video camera,
        set the video camera up to record safely from a distance and
        use the effect of the strobelight to create a slow motion effect..
        Thus kapturing the entire episode on tape for further enjoyment..

teknikal stuff:  used gettimeofday() to provide possibly-pseudo-random
behavior.  user (thats you) editable character substitution tables,
even in the executable (use a hex editor).  the multi-char substitutions
will have to be edited in the source.  used gcc to compile on sunos 4.1.3.
[cc expects k&r code, so edit it yourself if it doesn't compile]

usage: READ THE COMMENTS IN THE SOURCE AT THE BEGINNING.

bugs: email me at hojunya@ecf.toronto.edu  (thats at the university
of toronto for you canucks)

==============================================================================

  So.. a bit short of money are you? Need some quick cash to pay to be a
distribution site for one of the latest hot courier groups? Need some quick
dough to get that 28.8 modem for faster transfers? Need some green to
pay off your phone bill due to getting back billed for third party billing
your ex-girlfriends new boyfriend? Well, have no phear, BoW will show you
the fastest, easiest, and safest way to gleme yourself a few easy grand.
  What is your target? It is the defenceless Automated Teller Machine.
In this artical, we will step you through a painless way of obtaining all
the pocket money you need.
  First of all, you need to find a suitable teller... find one without
alot of people around it... far away from police stations, strip bars, bingo
parlors, head shops, or other popular places.. the ideal location is in a
deserted park, beach side cave, or a back alley way. Scope out this ATM day
and night for approximately two years, keeping track of when it is
refilled/emptied and when there are the least amount of people around.
  Once you have decided on the best day and time for your 'hit', you must
prepare.  The following materials are necessary for ATM hacking;
  1) An 'I PHEAR BoW' T-Shirt
  2) A large weapon, preferable a shotgun.
  3) Ammunition for the above weapon
  4) A large sack or handbag
  5) A can of blue spray paint
  6) A crow bar.
  Now once you have all of the above items, you must follow the steps provided
below.
  a) Put on your 'I PHEAR BoW' T-Shirt, this is probably the most critical
     step, as people will see it, and phear you immediately, seeing the
     word of BoW printed so clearly across your chest. In the event that
     there are any witnesses, they will be so overwhelmed by your
     flashy apparel, they will not remember your face.
  b) Put the can of spray paint, and the extra ammunition (make sure you
     fully load the weapon first) in the large sack or handbag, put this
     over your shoulder, and grab the crow bar in your left hand, the weapon
     in your right (opposite ofcourse if you are goofy handed).
  c) Now take a bus to the location of your previously picked out ATM.
     *DO NOT TAKE YOUR OWN VEHICAL, A STOLEN VEHICAL, OR A TAXI*. Public
     transport is much more environmentally sound. You may want to bring this
     up at your trial.
  d) Get off the bus atleast two stops before the ATM, and procede to walk
     toward the ATM. Keep your eyes straight ahead, look no one in the eye.
     If there are any parked vehicles on the way to the ATM, enjoy yourself,
     use the weapon to convert them to convertables, or rid them of excess
     glass. This is to maintain a high level of phear in the surrounding
     neighbourhood. (make sure all the vehicals you liberate of roofs and/or
     windows *DO NOT* have people in them. This would not be good).
  e) Now once you are in range of the ATM, take a couple of shots at it to let
     it know you mean serious business... take out the frount panel (two or
     three blasts... assuming a narrow spread high gauge shotgun blast) and
     the console display (one blast assuming above weapon).
  f) Now that it knows you mean business, introduce your crowbar to it's
     front panel... there may be a bit of confusion in the surrounding area
     by this time... but pay no heed... remember that God(tm) is on your
     side... (make sure to bring this up at the trial also). Once you
     have the front panel removed, locate the cash dispenser.. this may
     require a couple of exploritory blasts, but have no phear.
     (tell the jury you were simply curious).
  g) now remove the extra ammunition from your large sack or handbag, and
     reload your weapon, and put down the crow bar, and hold the blue
     spray paint can in your left hand (blue is the manditory color.. there
     are special chemicals in the blue paint that are necessary for this
     operation).
  h) Put down the weapon, and with your right hand, fill your large sack or
     hand bag with the cash from the dispenser.. this may take a while depending
     on how much money is contained at the time of the operation.
  i) once all the cash has been removed, spray paint on the wall next to the
     ATM your real name, your phone number and address, as well as your
     occupation (if any) and employer/school (again, if any) - the theory
     behind this is that the police will assume that no one would be foolish
     enough to perform such a stunt, and leave such obvious clues behind,
     you can claim that you were setup.
  j) Now wait for the return bus home, maybe stopping along the way for a
     beer (assuming of course that you are of legal drinking age) to cool
     your nerves.
  k) Bask in the pleasures of your trade.

I WANT MY 0-DAY....

Now look at them couriers.. that's the you do it...
Use the k0d3z, courier the 0-day.
that aint working, that's the way you do it.
all the latest warez get to come your way...
Now that aint working, that's the way you do it.
Lemme tell ya, them guys get the thrills,
maybe get a few duplicate releases,
maybe get a few back bills..

We gotta run a zero-day board
we gotta use the 0-day speak...
check all our users acronyms,
make sure our board's r eleet.

See the little faggot with the v.terbo and the k0d3z
yeah buddy, he is eleet..
that little faggot's got gigs of warez
that little faggot's got cracks and cheats

We gotta run a zero-day board
we gotta use the 0-day speak...
check all our users acronyms,
make sure our board's r eleet.

I shoulda filled out that RiSC application
I shoulda applied to P-W-A
look at those warez, just in one directory,
man, we could get some 0-day
And look over here, what's that? FSP site lists?
and FTP sites too to my dismay
that aint working, that's the way you do it.
all the latest warez get to come your way...

We gotta run a zero-day board

A DOS FTP site is currently setup to distribute BoW on a 0-day basis, check
out enigma.rhn.orst.edu D:\pub\BoW - this one should stay up until GrayArea
calls up her lawyers as it is run on a BoW members PC. Until then...

I'm still not sure if this has gone through yet, but we are in the process
of having a new site setup on internet, you can pick up back issues of
BoW at sun4.mfp.com /pub/mags/BoW and we (not sure of this part yet) might
have a mail alias setup at BoW@sun4.mfp.com  There may also be a mailing
list setup at this system, however we are not sure of the details yet.
Stay tuned. Grip your seat. Cower in phear. [note: this site recently
got smoked by evil HaQrZ, so it may be a while until it is back up again]

This one we had nothing to do with, but it seems you can pick up BoW at
etext.archive.umich.edu /Zines/Brotherhood.of.Warez and also /Zines/BoW
however their collection there is not quite complete.

0-DAY: IF YOU ARE ON IRC, YOU CAN SMAK YOURSELF A COPY OF ALL THE BoWS
