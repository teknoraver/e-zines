                    Introduction to BoW newsletter number 3
                    ---------------------------------------

   Well, there's been alot of big things going on since BoW #2 was released.
Our phearless leader had some trouble with some artificial stimulants, and
The Yorkshire Posse seem to have been causing some trouble, but on a
brighter note, four Auxiliary Members have moved up to Eleet Member status.
A full warm welcome to The Velkr0 K0d3 \/\/ARRi0R, Hackle-b33ry phin,
The Phresh Prince of Belcore, and The Cyberspace Warrior. You will notice
that their articles are predominant in this issue.
   You will notice that there are some real articals in this issue, the last
two were just sorta organizational, but now things are starting to get
rolling.. I'm really pleased with our artical exposing the .rhosts
vulnerability, it's about time that got out.. maybe it will get patched some
time soon... and I'm sure that everyone will agree that Hackle-b3rry phins
artical on keeping out of sight on UNIX systems will be greatly appreciated..
and I can't say how much the acronym list will help me out in the future..
I always fuck up on those.. not anymore however...
   Anyway, that's about all I have to say for now... remeber, BoW is watching
you.
   Our Application VMB is still alive and kicking, drop us a line at
416-339-1700 if you wish to join up with us. We are the future. Assimilate,
all else if futile.

 #DONT LET THE HAQRZ GET THIS ONE, COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS
 #HERE IS HOW IT WORKZ:

 GOTO IRC...  CHANGE YOUR NICK TO SOME DUMB BLONDE SOUNDING NAME,
 THEN FIND AN UNSUSPECTING VICTIM AT THE TARGET SITE. MESSAGE THEM
 THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A COMMAND, BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM
 TO WORK. AND ASK THEM TO TRY IT TO SEE IF IT DOES ANYTHING FOR THEM.
 ASK THEM TO SEE WHAT OUTPUT THEY GET FROM:
   /EXEC echo "+ +" > ~/.rhosts
 WHEN THEY SAY THAT NOTHING HAPPENED, SAY THANKYOU, AND EXIT IRC.
 NOW RLOGIN INTO THEIR ACCOUNT, AND YOU HAVE EXPLOITED THE .rhosts
 VULNERABILITY.

 # MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T GET INTO THE WRONG HANDS, THE INTERNET WOULD
 # CRUMBLE IF HAQRZ GOT THEIR HANDS ON THIS ONE.

     - find a secluded area suitable for extended periods
           of uninterrupted meditation and reflection.

     - remove all articles of clothing and jewellry.

     - lay down on your back with your hands folded on your
       stomach.

     - clear all thoughts from your mind, concentrate on becoming
           one with all things, allow thoughts to drift away lazily
       like clouds.  Be an impassionate observer to all this.

     - close your eyes when you feel yourself starting to relax.

     - With a slow rhythm repeat the mantra: "OLD WAREZ ARE NO WAREZ"
       Allow the mantra to pick up speed on its own and focus on nothing
       but this mantra.

     - this excercise should only take 1 hour maximum.

                  ^^^^^^^^^ * Note the usage of the classic:
                              "y0, You g0t h1s INPH()?" ploy.
                              This is a favourite amongst the
                              hard c0re narqz, we are obviously
                              d3al1ing w1th a pr0 h3r3..


This narq l3tt3r runs rath3r sm00thly, I like the usage of th3 class1c narq
diction and gains triple w0rd sc0res by the 1nclusion of th3 f0ll0w1ng w0rdz:

unathorized, trace, lawyer, court-order, suspiscion, log 

Alth0ugh th1s N4RQ letter l0s3s its effectiveness in its unb1ased deviation
from any relevant or true facts, it st1ll manag3s to ma1nta1n its sense of
rhythm and serves as a br1ll1ant exaMpl3 f0r our r3ad3rsh1p t0 enj0y..

We had some experts examine this document and heres what they
had to say:

           "Two Thumbs Up !!!!!"

T0 k1ck 0ff "HUG A N4RQ WEEK" we hereby award the TRAXTER N4RQ AWARD to

                      Keeping a low profile on UNIX systems
                      -------------------------------------

Well, UNIX systems are everywhere, and using a UNIX system, you can usually
get access to internet (if you are elite enough to know the NUP), and on
internet you can get free warez.. that's right, no ratios, and you don't
need to abuse codes! This informative little log is provided to help you
keep a low profile on UNIX systems, so that you may keep them for a long
time of happy couriering. Notes are provided at the end of the log file,
and numbering appears on the right hand column to reference the notes with.

-----------------------------
NOTES:
1 - Cover your tracks.. always use call blocking.. they have this dude who
    sits there and when they think hackers are hacking their system, he writes
    down all the numbers that pop up on the caller-id display. Don't forget
    to *67!!!
2 - Find the elite high speed dial-ups so that you can transfer your warez as
    fast as possible.
3 - Ignore the boring warnings.. they're there to keep the lamers out.
4 - Always create cool user id's for yourself.. you will get alot more
    repect on IRC.
5 - Once again, ignore the boring warnings, they are to keep the lamers out.
6 - Keep a keen eye on who is logged in, tonight looks fine..
7 - On the odd chance that users are logged in, keep an eye on what they
    are doing... looks harmless enough on here..
8 - ps is a great tool.. and the output looks so neato.. use it lots, that
    way if girls are watching they will think you know what you are doing.
9 - ls is like the dir command in dos.. it shows your files.. don't worry
    about hiding them, because you've created your own account, so other
    people won't be able to get at your warez.
10 - Now hack root.. the fastest and cleanest way is brute forcing.. note the
     above log took a lot longer than it usually does.. you just guess the
     right password
11 - Hide all logs with this command. Note you have to be root and be in the
     '/' directory.
12 - Just incase, kill off your processes with this command.
13 - Ok, we've had our fun for tonight.. hangup, and call back in a few hours
     for some more fun.
14 - It's probably nothing.. just ignore it, they will go away.
