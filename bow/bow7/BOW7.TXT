==============================================================================

 wow. it's here. number seven. what can i say. i've had my BBS hacked twice,
three of my accounts "rm -rf"-ed, i've been narqed on, my girlfriends been
narqed on, U4EA's been narqed on many many times... and guess what... we're
still here!
--
 well, in this action packed issue of BoW, you'll be shaken by "The Fall
of an Idol" - i know i was - and amoung many other things, you'll get a
change to participate in the exciting "ERASE ALL OF PLUVIUS' FILES"
competition, results will be announced in BoW 8.
--
 we are starting work on an exciting feature for BoW 8, "How to narq
effectively part ][", however we have a great shortage of narqletters..
so, send us your narq letters... it's easy... follow these steps:
  i) copy /usr/spool/mail/root to a temporary directory..
  ii) search for keywords such as 'inform', 'arrest', 'hack', 'illegal',
      'un-authorized', 'BoW', 'authorities', 'CERT', 'tolerate', and so
      on.
  iii) if you find occurances of any of these key phrases, then mail it
       off to BoW care of: pluvius@io.org on the information super high-way
--
 still no entries for the ascii art competition... so, one more time..
we need your ascii depictions of:
     1) Mangled farm animals
     2) Mutilated Pets
     3) Squished Rodents
     4) Geeky SysAdmins
send them to me.. address mentioned already...
--
 also, enigma.rhn.orst.edu went down for reason's i might mention later on,
so we are now sortof site-less.. so if you run a ftp site, or are elite
enough to have your PC strapped in tits first to the info super hiway,
give us a shout, and let us put BoW there.. that would be k-spiffy.
--
 You might have noticed that this issue is a tad smaller than usual, this
is because it's the beginning of the summer, and all our writers, instead
of writing articals, have been enjoying the freedom of the summer to stay
inside and kourier phresh warez.
--
 A special treat for all you warez dewdz out there... the BoW DEWM level
is here.. (PHaZe oNE).. it is very krad, and I have been spending all my
time playing it rather than studying for exams (you gotta have priorities
in life..) - check it out.. it's too big to include uuencoded in here,
but look for BoW7.5.zip or BoW7DEWM.zip or BoW.SeVeN.aND.a.HaLF.zip at
the usual places.. it is well worth trying out..

  BoW Magazine is an electronic magazine published whenever we feel like it,
  specializing in Computer Deviency, Software Piracy, Computer Insecurity,
  Telecommunications Fraud, and other nasty things. The long distance carriers
  phear us.

  BoW Magazine is KopyWrong (K) 1994. Any unauthorized distribution is
  not elite, and we will get Eugene Spafford to ethertrace your ass right
  down to tempest tapping your home if you distribute these electrons without
  prior consent of God. God can be reached in New York City, at HOPE.
  Go to the CON and ask him... then it will be ok. You can also distribute
  this magazine in an unauthorized fashion if either a) Your Grade 7 teacher,
  or b) A Real Cyberpunk [in the event you never made it to grade 7]
  say it's ok. Real Cyberpunks can be reached at the following email
  addresses: idol@well.sf.ca.us, president@whitehouse.gov, cyber_p@att.att.com
  cpunx@cert.org. If you don't have access to email, then call up a cyberpunk
  at the following phone number: +31-337. Ask them... tell them you would
  like to distribute BoW magazine in an unauthorized fashion. They will be
  able to give you permission.

Submissions can be emailed to me, at pluvius@io.org, or can be uploaded
to our SUBMISSIONS BBS, Twilight of the Idols, see add at the end of this
issue. Alternately you can look for me on IRC, I have no life, I will
probably be there (check #BoW, #WaReZ666, #KoURiERZ, or #ZeR0DaY).
A word on submissions: if it's not funny, we won't print it.

[hmm.. you may or may not have noticed, but enigma.rhn.orst.edu is now down,
 once again BoW loses a precious internet site.. someone thought that it
 would be cool to fake logs of someone hacking off his site... he ended
 up getting suspended from university and loosing his link. it's interesting
 to note that a certain other eubercracker was faking logs from U4EA's site
 not too long ago.... i wonder if there's a connection?]

[editor's note: is it really true? I saw the 99.9 release of COPS, but I did
 not have enough file points to download it, so I am stuck with 99.8... for
 now. Your site has been added to the official koalition for faster warez
 site list, breeth deeply, inhale, for you have now joined those phearless
 enough to stand downwind from the phearsome VeLKR0 K0D3 WaRRi0R, bath
 in the darkness of his long shadow - all others be weary, for soon yee shall

Subject: BoW Submission

  Dear sirs,,
  I am not sure how  broach this issue of a very serious nature, so if I
  seem clumsy or incoherant, it is only a product of my hesitance. I am
  about to engage with you a tale of broken heroes and idols fallen, one
  wich I had hoped to have never had opportunity to relate, yet in the face
  of greater truths I must stand erekt. And so with great grief and sorrow
  I give you this expose I have titled, The Fall of an Idol.

==============================================================================
                        .---------------------------.
                             The Fall Of an Idol
                                by Idiotproof
                        `---------------------------'

 Just last night I was sitting in a small teleconferance with some other
 extremely elite gentleman, I will not relate their names for fear of
 reprecussions. I will label them...Indian Doctor Guy, and Smak Addict.
 We were as usual discussing other people in the scene moreover we were
 discussing a Paramount Icon in the H/P world. A bastion of Digital
 intrusion, we were in short disussing ERIKB! the lord of all things Phrack.
 In order to properly relate our reverance for erik I feel it necesary to
 give you an excerpt from our conversation. Please note it is not Verbatim
 as i do not follow the traxter rule of thumb and tape all my confs...Just
 some.

Idiotproof: Ya! Fuckyou Bitch! So what if I am a fucking reprobate, I have
            your fucking info#@!$#@!

Smak Addict: Uhhh, idiotproof man, like she's gone man. i think she bailed
             a while back.

Indian Doctor Guy: Hah, fuck her. Whats a nun doing on a teleconf anyhow?

Idiotproof: I dunno, ummm, hey what's with that erikb guy?

SA: Werd doesn't he like fuck kids?

IDG: Heh, I hear he has a thing for poking corpses...

Idiotproof: <Gasp> Surely U jest, Erik rites phrack@@# He is the penultimate
            telenet scanner. I am shocked.

IDG: Umm ya goodpoint.

Idiotproof: Umm , I think my foundation of faith for Erikb Iz crumbling, If I
            do not rectify this i will melt away.. I must do something about
            this. I'll be back later. <Click>

** <-- note at all points here within i will be using "**" to narate this
**     shattering feat of journalistic probing

** I have decided that only way to ascertain the truth of erikb's true
** nature is to invade his very sanctuary. For in order to learn the nature
** of the beast is to root through his very lair.
** Through some very elyte contaks I have gained info on his machine wich
** will enable me 2 penetrate it. I might add that you will see some VERY
** advanced hacking techniques in this t-file please not try to perform
** these manouvers as you have probably not read all of the phracks as I
** have and gleened all of the elite hacking info that I have. I will however
** attempt to give you brief explanations as I go along so maybe you can learn
** as much as I have.

 Spaffbabe,
 It seems things are working out ever since I have taken up the editor-ship
 of phrack I have sent you all the elite inpho i get sent to me and replaced
 it with that shit your retarded son wrote. hahahhahha. AND NO ONE has
 figured us out yet! We will soon rule the net, MOD is dewmed. Also i tried
 to stop chasin from releasing the sendmail info, but he won't talk to me
 still. Sorry bout that

ps. About your son. I know you spend alot of time at work, does your kid need
    an uncle at large by any chance???? If so I am availible

# more traxtur
 Pat,
  Ok listen ( get it? hahahahahah ) I am really sorry about releasing your
  -I am not a narq- tfile so early without first spellchecking it, I am
  sure you know it was a mistake. So now that we have made up I need a
  favour from you. I need netw1z's info real bad. If you could get it to
  me I will ensure that no one thinks you are a narq anymore. Because you
  know my word has alot of weight in the h/p community. Also I will get those
  bastards in BoW to leave you alone.

ps. I am starting an elite group, the members so far are me (erik bloodaxe
    editor of phrack) and Agent Steel, R u interested in joining?

   OK ueber-crackers.. get your scripts handy... BoW has a challenge for
you to prove eliteness... stand prepared for....

             ** THE ERASE ALL OF PLUVIUS' FILES COMPETITION **

   Since today marks the third account of mine that has been "rm -rf"-ed,
as well as my BBS was hacked for the second time this morning.. i have
decided to embrace the mood of hacking pluvius's computers, and create a
new, and real challenge for the ueber-crackers to prove their eliteness...
   There remains one account of mine that has yet to get wiped... yes, my
acadvm1.uottawa.ca account.. so, in the spirit of maliciousness and mal-intent
that I know you all have, I propose that the first ueber-crackers to hack my
acadvm1 account shall be written down in my books as truley elite.. now you
must get into my account, and wipe it entirely leaving only one file called
"YOUSUCK", which can contain any text you like, so long is there is a nick in
there that I can use to give credit to.. (make one up, I don't care).. I very
sincerely doubt that the d00dz who wiped my other three accounts will have a
chance, but I am leaving it open.. if you think you are worthy.. go for it..
deadline is before the release of BoW #8... so you have an entire month.. it
only takes a few key strokes (and no brains) to run scripts.. so go for it
ueber-crackers.
   If you get into my account, and it is already cleaned out (you were too
late) then create a "YOUSUCK2", or "YOUSUCK3" etc. etc. so you can claim
the second place (or third, or fourth...) prize.. results will be announced
in BoW #8.. good luck, you will definitely need it..

==============================================================================

    A Tale From Onkel Dittmeyer's Weird Bedtime Stories
   =====================================================

    Hello BoW reader. I have to reveal you a secret, as I
  will very likely get killed if I remain the only one that
  knows about it. Remember Phil Zimmerman? Okay. Read on.
  And keep a paper hanky close at hand.

    It was a calm saturday night in spring. On my way home
  from a party, I stumbled down the streets on the outskirts
  of my town. The sidewalk was utterly deserted, and the
  only light was that of the moon, which was full and shone
  down on the concrete, cold and harsh like a blade.
  Shrugging a little, I made my way and passed the local
  cemetary. I was startled and frightened to see that the
  rays of the moon were not the only reflections flicking
  off the tombstones. There was a dim, eerie light coming
  down from a vault. Suddenly, I broke stride and listened
  closely. A faint mumble was coming from the direction of
  the light, and I decided to check it out. After I crossed
  the fence to this place of death, I vigilantly stepped
  down the ramshackle stairs to the vault, and suddenly I
  realized that the light came from dozens and dozens of
  torches stuck into cracks in the walls. At least fifty
  creatures were hunched in front of an altar that was
  covered with red satin. The creatures, all dressed in
  black cloth, did not seem to notice me. They were in
  trance, repeating a mantra, over and over, picking up
  speed and volume, but still too low to understand the
  meaning of the words, which sounded foreign and alien to
  me. All the creatures looked like they were suffering
  great fear. Fear so deep and sincere that they could not
  even notice my humble self who just stumbled into this
  sepulchre where they hold their, um, seance. They were
  apparently worshipping a black monolith that was propped
  upright on the satin cover of the altar. It was very flat
  and did not glisten or reflect any light, it seemed that
  it in fact absorbed the light, that is how utterly,
  incredibly black it was. So light-absorbing that it was
  hard to make out any details except for its perfect,
  rectangular shape. I could not turn down my interest in
  this object. Half a dozen red light glistened in it like
  rubys lit up from a noon sun behind them. The mesmerizing
  smell of incense blurred my receiption as I homed in and
  approached the altar slowly, careful not to catch the
  attention of any of the worshippers. The mantra pulsed
  louder and louder from their throats, and by the time I
  got into arm-lenght distance of the monolith, it was
  deafeningly loud, but still uncomprehendable alien in my
  mind. So close to the black rectangle, I could make out
  that there was something engraved in it, carved into it
  like an epitaph, and when I reached out to touch it, an
  electric sparkle stabbed my arm like a thousand blades. It
  felt cold and smooth. As I picked up to read the
  engravement, the mantra suddenly subsided and a thousand
  eyes stared at me with a violence and evil so deep it
  almost stopped my heart, although I would not give up and
  run already so far at it. I digged the Zippo out of my
  jeans pocked and flicked the reel to be able to read what
  was written on the black, cold monolith I now held in my
  hands, red lights still glowing in it like precious jewels.

    It said "USRobotics Dual Standard HST".

    Suddenly all the worshippers, their eyes scorched by the
  flash of light irradiating from my lighter, fell into a
  frantic, simultane screaming.

    They yelled "LaMeR!! - LaMeR!! - LaMeR!!".

    They then slowly started walking towards me with their
  hands raised and sprawled out like claws.

    I dropped the monolith, and as it shattered on the
  floor, all the worshippers suddenly fell inert and
  lifeless. I hurried home, and when I came back to the
  vault on the next morning, nothing was in there except for
  some dust on the dank ground where those beasts stood
  during the last night. I then doubted my memory, but black
  shatters on the floor just in front of the altar where I
  let go of the monolith proved that it was not only a
  blurred product of my mind, but bare fact. I could make
  out the words "with ASL" on one piece, the letters "HS" on
  another. I hurried home and hastily burned the splinters
  in the kitchen oven. But since, on every night in the
  month when the moon is full and shines down on the inert
  planet with its silver, cold light, those creatures came.
  back to me to haunt me in my dreams, screaming the word
  "LaMeR!!" over and over and over. Now, where you all know
  about this, I will hopefully be able again to rest at
  night.

    May you sleep well tonight.

       "(ting ting) Ein Lied": Warez Board Discipline
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Sing by the instrumental of "Urban Discipline" by Biohazard
                            ----

   Growing up I've seen a lot of warez in my time
   I've seen Windows, Windows, Desqview, Zip, DPaint and Mime
   I have learned from the mistakes of friends that went bust
   And from those who have failed cause they lacked warez bloodlust
   Life is just too short I realize that now
   I'm gonna get my warez together, encode them to BoW
   Cause one thing that I have learned is that you only live once
   So now I'll run the Dual Standard and use k0dez till they crunch

   Knowledge of the boards, a valuable tool
   Type of education you can't get in school
   Many hard times, losing warez, getting kicked
   You try to /n00k me, but I am wicked
   A kid like clay molded by its surrounding
   Brain all messed up from the .MODs that are pounding
   Assembly line that I've been though
   A hard warez sucker with a bad attitude
   Maybe its just the times we live in
   Maybe its just Warez Board Discipline

   That ways of warez board life are not as they seem
   Pumping up and leeching is what calling here means
   In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
   The only lessons you learn are from warez that get faked

   Lead
   Verse II

   Elusive, AD, Boomtown, Unlawful and Warez Streams
   Pumping up and leeching is what calling here means
   In order to survive you've got to earn your respect
   The only lessons you learn are from warez that get faked
