-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        We had just gotten home from the movies, and my parents still
weren't home. It was about 10:00pm, so it was already dark outside. I
turned on a few lights and asked her what she wanted to do. She said she
wanted to relax on the couch for a little bit, but I had other, more
active, plans. I asked her if she wanted something to drink, and she
said sure, so we walked into my kitchen. As we walked in the door to the
kitchen, I had to stop to marvel. We had just moved in a little while
back, and I was still amazed at how cool and modern it looked.
        Straight ahead of me was a full sized window that looked out
upon our side yard, and at our neighbor's house. They also had one, and
it looked directly at ours. Sometimes when I was bored, I'd sit there
and watch my neighbors mill around, and catch a glimpse every once and a
while of their daughter, Millissa. In the middle of this grand kitchen
was a table that we all sat at to eat, do work, etc. On my right was a
door to the porch, and to the left of the door was a sink, dish washer,
and cabinet where we put dishes and other kitchen shit. To the right of
the door it was bare, and across from the door, immediately to the left
of where I was standing, there was a walk-in pantry, where my family
kept a lot of the dried and canned food. To the right of the pantry was
a little table against the wall, and a refrigerator. Anyway, enough of
new homes and gardens, back to reality.
        I walked over to the fridge and grabbed a couple of drinks, and
walked back over to the table. We sat down, and she started talking
about one of her classes at school, and what had happened that day. I
wasn't real interested, and my eyes wandered to the window. I was
staring out into our neighbor's house again. I couldn't help it, it was
a habit. I always ended up doing this when my father lectured me too.
They were sitting there watching TV, because they had made that room
that the window was in their living room instead of their kitchen like
we had. I couldn't see Millissa, so bored again, I looked out onto the
street, and noticed something sneaking around in the front yard, trying
hard not to be seen. It was darting from tree to tree, and had a faint
blue light that was scanning the ground in front of it, and then moved
up the walk and pointed at the neighbor's front door. It wandered up,
and then knelt at the door and started playing with the lock. My
girlfriend finally noticed that I wasn't paying attention and said
        "Are you listening to me?"
        "Hang on, it looks like someone is trying to break into the
neighbor's house."
        "What are you crazy," She said, and then her face took on a
different look as I pointed out the figure, still kneeling at the door.
"We have to call the neighbors and let them know before someone gets hurt"
        I quickly picked up the phone, heeding her advice, and stood
there, looking out the huge window into their house. Ring... Ring...
        "Hello?" A beautiful voice said, which I recognized as
Millissa's.
        "Millissa? Look out your window next door" She did, and smiled.
        "Hey, what's going on?"
        "Well, to be blunt, I think someone is trying to break in your
house."
        "What?? Are you serious? Where?"
        "It's coming in through your front door. Quick, tell your dad to
get his .44."
        "Okay, hang o........"
        The line had gone dead, and I was shaking, and uncontrollably at
that. Then I heard a scream. And ear piercing scream, just like you see in
the movies. Except this was real, so real that I watched her wonderful body
be smeared across the window right in front of me, gore coating the window
and it's surroundings. I was surprised that she hadn't gone through the
window, she had been hit so hard by something from behind and her stomach
had been practically thrown all over the window. I dropped the phone, and
my girlfriend screamed. The blue light was inside Millissa's house, and it
was pointing straight at my chest through the two windows. I quickly ducked
down, and moved out of the way, so he couldn't see me through the window.
        I then noticed the blue light outside, flashing around in no
apparent pattern. I hushed my girlfriend, as she was quaking in fear, and
about to scream. I put her in the walk-in pantry next to me, and went
and got my knife that was on top of the refrigerator. I strapped the
case to my waist, and then pulled the knife from the belt. It was a
wicked knife, the blade about six inches long, waving in and out,
forming a menacing, jagged, serrated edge, and coming to a double point
like a snakes tongue, with both sides as sharp as the high pitched
scream my girlfriend would have uttered, had I not stopped her. I
pressed myself up against the wall to the side of the door, standing
where I couldn't be seen from outside. I then watched as the strange blue
light came across the porch, and then up over the floor, and then around
and about the kitchen, looking, scanning. It then stopped, and blinked
out like a candle in a warm summer breeze. Then I heard a small click as
it grasped the doorknob and slowly turned it. Then in one swift motion,
the holder of the blue light slammed into the door and burst inside,
gun leveled. Luckily for me, we had installed a little door stopper that
prevented the door from slamming into the wall behind it, and the door
came about two inches from my nose, and then stopped. He saw a movement
on the counter across from him, which was probably a rat, and let his
trigger finger itch run wild. He sprayed the room in a sweeping motion,
not exactly aiming, keeping the weapon at a constant height. My thoughts
flashed for a moment to my girlfriend in the closet, wondering if she
had just stood there, or had the brains enough to duck down. I decide not
to worry about it for the moment and turned my attention back to the
intruder. He had stopped shooting, and stood there, looking around, smoke
wafting from the end of his gun, surveying the room. When he was content
that nothing else in the room was going to move, he took a step forward
and shut the door I was hiding behind. That's when I made my move. I
swung my wicked knife as hard as I could, across the man's throat. This
move took him totally by surprise, and the artery I cut spilled it
precious fluid all over my knife, hand, and arm. I jerked the knife out
of his neck, and turning it so that it pointed downwards in my hand,
buried it to the hilt in his throat, above his breastbone pointing down
towards his heart. The man slowly collapsed to the floor, his life taken
from his body. I breathed a sigh of relief, and stopped for a minute to
compose myself and let my adrenaline wear out. I then thought again about
my girlfriend in the closet, and went to open the door. I stopped with my
hand on the doorknob, and looked at the bullet holes cris-crossing the
door in a pattern like an X stretched out lengthwise. I then slowly
turned the doorknob and looked inside. She was slumped against the back
shelf, her chin on her chest, with no apparent strength in her. I took
one step forward, and put a soft finger under her chin. I gently lifted
her head up and watched in horror as it limply fell over, exposing the
blood coating her throat and chest. The bullets had first swept across
her throat, and then evidently as she was falling, one had entered her
throat above her breastbone, going down towards her heart. I was so
shocked at the gruesome sight that I could only stare in horror. The
agony that filled me was unbelievable, and I looked from her throat to
the bloody knife in my hand, and understood what I had to do. I slowly
brought it up to my navel, and forced it into my gut. I screamed in pain
as I pulled it up my abdomen and into my chest, but not a physical pain.
The pain in my mind was beyond everything else I was experiencing. The
knife cut my breastbone right in half, it was so sharp, and I opened my
chest, exposing my heart and lungs. I grasped my heart in my right hand,
the heart that had given itself to the woman I loved, the woman now
lying with lead imbedded in her body, the lead feared by many yet used
by all, the little lead leeches that suck the life from you and destroy
your happiness and well being. I turned my attention back to my heart,
the heart that people kill, rape, and die for, the heart that causes
people to hurt themselves out of the need for the companionship of
another equally worthless and devilish heart. I despised and hated
this heart, yet needed it to survive this heartless world and obeyed
it's cruel and unusual wishes.
        These were the things that ran through my mind as I crushed this
devil in my hand, this devil that we depended on, the devil and
perpetrator of evils that we cannot live without.
