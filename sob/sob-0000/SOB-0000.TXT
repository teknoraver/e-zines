Welcome to the premire issue of Soveriegns Of Bell. I know what you are saying
"Oh shit, another fukcing group. Whaen will this attack ever end?" And you know
what? You're right. Another fucking group. And if you don't like it, oh well. I
don't really care. Actually I do, but that's besides the point. What was I
talking about again? Never mind. Anyway, I guess I ought to explain the short
history of this group and how it came about.
   For about a year, there was a group called Unknown. A couple of good friends
and I decided that it would be cool if we could get a bunch of people together
and form our own group. It sounded like a good idea, so we got it started. As
time went on, and we spread out from the local scene, the group got bigger, and
started having distribution sites pretty much all over the country. And, well,
we could not get anything done. We finally collected enough information to put
in a magazine format, and did so. It did not seem like a very big hit, and
interest slackened. The groups forward progress came to a virtual stand-still.
I got frustrated and after several futile attempts at getting people together,
I called my Senior staff over to my house and we decided to abandon the group.
We still wanted to be active, and since it seems that we had such twisted
minds, that it would suit us to form a group, but this time make it a text
based group, concentrating on humor and some PH here and there. Well, the
existing members of Unknown decided they would like to be a part of this new
organization, and volunteered their sevices. At the end I will provide a
current listing of the existing members.
   So, here we are. Like us or not, that's your choice. Be looking for us, and
flick off your local Bell serviceman for us.
