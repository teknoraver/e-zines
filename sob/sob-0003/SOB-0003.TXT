         How To Make A Miniture Chlorine Factory In Your Garage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        First off, lets get one thing clear. This should NOT under ANY
circumstances be attempted. Period. Thats all there is to it. I, or any
ascociates shall or will be held liable for your dumb ass fucking something
up. There. Now that that's said and done, on to THE CHLORINE FACTORY.

        Gather some basic materials. First, you need 2 large flasks or
bottles <1/2 gallon or so>, a small flask, 2 one hole rubber stoppers, a
3 hole rubber stopper <probably need to be hand made>, about 5 or 6 feet
or rubber <I perfer silicone> fishtank tubing, about a foot and a half of
glass or hard plastic pipe that will fit inside the ends of the rubber
tubing, some kind of container to fill with the chlorine <I perfer baloons>,
and 2 aquarium air control valves.

	First, construct the system, as designed in the following diagram:

 __________                                  __________
 \        / -- Fill with ammonia             \        /  -- Fill with Clorox
  \~~~~~~/     Large Flask                    \~~~~~~/      Large Flask
   \    /                                      \    /
    \__/                                        \__/
      |              Chlorine Container          |
      |                                          |
      V --Valve          |              Valve -- V
      |                 ___                      |
      |_____________   /   \   __________________|
                    | |     |  |
                    |  \_ _/   |
                    |    |     |
                    |___ |  ___|
                        || |
                        ----
                       /    \  -- Small Flask
                      /      \
                     /________\

Now, you have it set up. Flip over the 2 large flasks so that the clorox and
ammonia will flow down the tubes. Ok, now here is the important part. Begin
by turning on the ammonia flask's valve just enough to get a trickle of
liquid started in the small flask. Repeat with the other bottle. Now,
gradually turn them up, but never let the fluid get above 1/4 mark of the
flask. The gas should begin acumulating in the container for the clorine. The
trick to it is to get a valve setting that will create optimum gas output.
Make VERRRY sure, however, that the seals on EVERYTHING is EXTREMELY secure.
Chlorine is leathal, and will kill you if taken in even small quantities. The
liquid should change to gas at a steady rate and maintain a rather stable
fluid level in the small flask. If not, adjust the valves. Now, when you have
accumulated enough gas, shut off the valves, return the large flasks to an
upright condition, and cap off the container for the chlorine VERY SECURELY!
It is recomended that you pick up an unused gasmask at the next gunshow, and
handle everything with gloves. You now have a very toxic chemical on your
hands. This makes for very effective animal killing and such. Use your
imagination. Heh.

Until next time, keep it safe.
