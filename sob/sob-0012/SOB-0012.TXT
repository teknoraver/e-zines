Drugs. They've driven the entire nation ape-shit. I'll tell why they shouldn't.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        First of all, I hate categorizing everything under one word.

These are the ways I classify the types of drugs.
     1. Tobacco and Alcohol.
         These are legalized drugs that can kill you as easily as a gun shot.
     2. Marijuana.
         An Illegal drug that has never been proven bad for you, and right
         now is prescribed 12 people in the US for medical purposes.
     3. LSD.
         There is a lot of debate about LSD and it's mental side effects,
         most studies have concluded that in large dosages it can be harmful.
     4. Psychedelics - PCP, Ecstasy, Etc.
         Illegal drugs that are Psychoactive, and have been proven deadly.
     5. IntraVenous Drugs - heroin, Etc.
         This shit is so fucking stupid, it amazes me anyone does it. This
         is one way AIDS is spread. Maybe it's not so bad, these people
         should die anyway, instead of wasting away my fuckin taxes.
     6. Other Shit - Crack, Cocaine, Etc.
         Ditto the above. These people tend to be the ones who commit
         crimes to get money for drugs, and in their dependence on a
         SUBSTANCE they commit murder. Great guys, you're real fucking
         people.

Two of these drugs have never been proven to be harmful, and if done right,
are generally safe. The other three will fuck you up BAD and are proven to
kill you sooner or later. The two safest ones are easiest to get (at least
for me), one of the killer ones is relatively easy to get, and the other
two I don't know because I have never inquired. Can you guess which are
which? The two safest - Marijuana and LSD.
        I have made a small rule for myself. Anything that is known to
cause you serious damage and/or death is out of my life. I smoked for
quite a while, and have recently quit (again :) because I think I may be
a tad bit hooked. But I am eliminating that out of my life. The reason :
why the fuck do I want lung cancer? I don't give a shit about the pain I
will have to go through, I just have a little consideration for the people
(my kids, wife, parents, etc.) who will have to watch me die. Guys, you
may hate your parents now, (I know I do sometimes) but one day you are
going to love them again because you are not living with them. You will be
in another household, and will begin to appreciate what they did for you.
(And NO my parent's didn't write that.) I'm not saying you should kiss
your parent's asses or anything like that, I'm just saying look at your
future and see what's going happen, and if it's bad, prevent it.

        Anyway.

        Alcohol. I'm sorry it's just no fun. You can't walk well, you
can puke, and most of all YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT
DAY. Who the fuck wants to get toasted but never remember what happened?
You could have gotten some pussy and never known. That's no fucking fun.
You also have a hangover in the morning, no matter how big/small. I have
never had to pay any sort of physical price for going and smoking a joint
or dropping acid. Okay, sure, chicks are easier to lay when they are
drunk, but have you ever gotten drunk and fucked some ugly chick because
you were toasted? Do you know that when stoned, a chick will get it on
the same way she will on alcohol, but will have more fun? Have you ever
had a sexual experience while stoned? It is something you can't even
imagine, and if you think fucking is great, try it with some weed.
(You) Will blow your (wad) mind.
        Anyway, back to the harder drugs. Why would you possibly want to
do any type of narcotic? Number One they will fucking kill your ass
quicker than anything, and Number Two cops love to bust fucking crack
heads and heroin addicts. You take the risk of getting diseases from
shared needles, and you abandon your entire life and become dependent on
something. That's another thing. Anytime you find yourself dependent on
ANYTHING, girlfriend, parents, food, cigarettes, drugs (of any kind),
get rid of it. You are not yourself, and need help. Find a way to do the
same thing, but without being dependent on it.

        Now I will talk about a few issues I think all you fucking
right-wing Fundamentalist Christian Pieces of Shit should listen to.

        On to my first "good" drug. LSD. Acid, The Purple Haze Maker.
I'm not sure about LSD. I have heard about people who have OD'd before,
and of people that have scratched themselves to death, thinking they
had roaches all over them. Yet I have heard of people who have composed
songs while in La-La land and have gone on to make mega-zillions of
dollars. The secret is being around good people, people who will help
you have a good trip. People who will help you by showing you pretty
things and if you are scared will help you out by saying nice things.
Just in general have a good time. It is all a factor of taking a SMALL
amount and then enjoying it. Never combine drugs, also. Then you have
serious problems. Just pick one at a time, take it, and enjoy it. I
don't think LSD is very safe, then again, I don't think it's very bad
either. When in moderation, it is cool. (just like hacking :)

        Big Brother has repressed drugs for years. When you repress
something, or take it away, it becomes more of a fascination for people in
general. That's how people work. Remember that little human trait called
curiosity? That's what I am talking about. In effect, by creating laws
and enforcing rules on people, Big Brother is in effect amplifying a
human's curiosity and desire to break the law. When Big Brother tried to
abolish the most common drug a while back, Alcohol, it didn't work
because the Mafia started moving the shit in by the fucking case. So Big
Brother repealed it, and alcohol now has become a lot more managed than
it used to be. There are age restrictions and limits on what companies
can put in them. Shit, Coca-Cola used to have cocaine in it, and that was
why people kept drinking it. Marijuana is grown in backyards and hidden
bushes, near places where people throw their garbage and toxic chemicals
reside. All this makes it semi-unsafe to use. If legalized, regulations
would be imposed, and people would have a safer way to use the plant.
Holland has taken this course and recently repealed that law, and now
sells marijuana in stores. Their reason for doing this, "Because we
understand that a lot of kids experiment with drugs, and 90% of kids
that experiment with them in High School do not become dependent on them.
Therefore, by providing access to marijuana, most kids will not be
exposed to harder, more deadly drugs." And, Holland's crime rate has
dropped some 23% from last year. Now tell me there is something wrong there.

        This leads me to my last point. Everyone knows that as a teen,
you are experimenting with your life to see what you like/dislike. You
develop a defined taste for women, styles, and experiences. Drugs have
always been part of these experiences throughout History. To limit these
experiences are in effect to limit your life. They say marijuana/LSD
spawns creativity, but I really don't think so. I think the effect of an
experience in another mind frame is what spawns creativity. I think
everyone should trip/smoke a bowl once in their life, just to experience
the feeling of being totally different, and out of their usual mindset.
With a little care and effective planning/execution, doing LSD/Juan can
be an life enriching experience and not a detrimental one.

 And, in closing, a small quote from the Cypress Hill album _Black_Sunday_

     More than 400,000 Americans die from diseases related to cigarette
             smoking each year.
     More than 150,000 Americans die of alcohol abuse each year.

     BUT IN 10,000 YEARS OF USAGE, NO ONE HAS EVER DIED FROM MARIJUANA.
