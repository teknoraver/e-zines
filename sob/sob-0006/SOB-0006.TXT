Introduction
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        Well, I have seen many files on beige boxing and the like, but
nothing real comprehensive and simple. So I wrote one. I will outline
good and bad things to do. But first I want to warn everyone who is
reading this : BEIGE BOXING _IS_ A FELONY. It will seriously fuck you
and your record up. It is considered a line-tapping device under some
article of the constituion. If you are smart and safe you won't get
caught, I have been boxing for about a year now, and have happily
enjoyed spending other people's money.
        Anyway, fuck the feds, here's the good shit. Long Live AT&T!

Beige Box Plans
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        Unlike other people, I am not a electronics stud and cannot
build myself a beige box. So, I will tell you how to make one that works
just as well, and may save yourself a telephone. Go to your electronics
store and buy yourself a set of four double ended alligator clips. It
doesn't matter what color you get, but look and see if you can find a
red and green one. Now get a single phone wall jack. Now you have all
you need to make a beige box. take the wall jack, and strip the casing
holding all the wires. Then strip the red and green wires, and attach
the corosponding color alligator clips. Now, you can plug your laptop,
phone, or anything else into that jack. Proceed to attach it to the bare
wires in any Bell box, and you're in. Now that you know how easy that
is, you might even want to buy yourself a second jack and use the left
over alligator clips to make another one. What I love doing is talking
on someone's line long distance while also fucking around LD on my
laptop. What a pleasure.

Types Of Bell Boxes Around, and How To Get Into Them
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        The first kind of box and most common one by far are the little
green boxes. They are most of the time about 3 feet high, and are
rectangular. The sides are rounded, and they have bolts in the side.
These bolts can be taken off with a 9/16th inch wratchet. These normally
have two terminal pads on them, with about 25 lines available. All lines
aren't always hooked up, but you only need one, right? These are mostly
found in buisness office complexes, although I have seen them at the end
of the street in some old neighborhoods.
        The second kind of box are about 2 feet high, and are shaped
like tall skinny cylinders. They have two bolts at the bottom of them,
but you don't even have to unscrew those, just twist the whole thing
counter clockwise and wait until you feel it move all the way. Then pull
up, and the whole casing comes off. Sometimes you may have to loosen
them, if the Bell guys have tightened them real tight, although I doubt
it because they are lazy fucks, and don't want to do the extra work.
        The third kind of box is about 5-6 feet high, and about 4 feet
wide. It has two doors on the front, and two on the back. Some of the
locks on those doors are strange, I haven't yet seen a tool that opens
them, they look like this :   ___
                             / _ \
                            | | | |
                           | | . | |
                            | |_| |
                             \___/    Excuse the shitty drawing, but
hey. Anyway, they are circular, and have a dot in the middle. You must
need some funky tool, because I've never run into anything like that
before. Next to this thing should be a hexagonal bolt, so whip out your
9/16th inch (wratchet, I hope) and put that in there. Find the tool for
that other thing and your in. But until then, wait. Also, I have seen
the doors without those wierd locks, just a hexagonal bolt and a handle.
Put your wrench in there, turn counter-clockwise, and pull up on the
handle, and it should pop open. These are fairly rare, (ie: I have found
you will only find them one in every 4 sets of doors you look at) so you
might not be lucky enough to get in these. These fuckers are _huge_,
they have about 200 lines in each side.
        The fourth kind of box are small, they are about 6 inches but a
foot. They are normally on the back of duplexes, or some newer homes.
They have two sections, the top one says "For Bell Access Only" and the
bottom says "For Customer Access". Heh, well this time whip out your
3/8inch wratchet and open this puppy. This will allow you access to
that persons line.

Good Things To Do Once You've Established a Line
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        Okay, now that you know about your boxes, here's what to do with
them. When you find a box, identify where it goes to. (ie: buisness or
residential) Buisness lines are eaiser to box off of because at night no
one is there, and you for sure won't get caught on the phone. Residential
lines are better to set up conferances on, because sometimes the buisness
will have one central line, and then have a switching board that will
send incoming calls elsewhere. Okay, now that you have identified that,
open the box, strip one set of wires with your knife, and take your
alligator clips and hook them on the exposed wire. If you get a dial
tone, that's good. If you don't, try reversing your clips and checking
again. If you still don't get a dial tone, switch to another line. Now,
take the spool of wire that you have and hook it on to the two exposed
wires. Then run it somewhere where no one will see you and you can
safely box. (Note: You don't have to do this if you are out of sight,
but it will ensure your safety a little more) Make sure that the wire
isn't faulty by hooking your box back up to the other end of the wire,
and seeing if you get a dialtone. If you do, good. If you don't, check
your contacts with the spool of wire and the line in the box. Make sure
they are secure. If it still doesn't work, trash the wire and try again.
If you get it to work, then go back and dig a little trench, it doesn't
have to be deep, and bury your wire. This will allow you to stay pretty
hidden, and the only way you will be caught if you are out of sight is
if the bell guy comes and discovers your wire while you are on it. If he
does discover your wire, all he will probably do is rip it out. If you
find your cord it gone, then I wouldn't advise using that box again.
There should be plenty more around, you just have to look. Another good
thing to do is get on a residential line, do an ANI on it, call a
friend, and tell him to call you back. Then call someone else, and talk
for a little bit. If you hear a little beep while you are talking, hit
the hang up button real fast and then see if it gives you the other
person who is calling. If so that person has call waiting, and that is
good for setting up conferances or carding items. I will explain why
later.

Chapter V   -
Setting Up a Conferance
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        So you want to set up a conferance, eh? Or do you know what a
conferance is? A conferance is where you can have as many people on a
line at the same time. There are many different ways of doing this, and
I will outline these. The carrier I will describe here is AT&T, and the
reason I use them instead of lets say MCI or Sprint is because they
aren't pricks about it and all. AT&T is the easiest to set up, and if
you do it right, will guanrentee you hours of fun.
        The line you probably want to hook up to do this from is a
residential line. You can use a buisness line, but in the past I have
found it harder to do. Residential boxes are easier to get to, and as
you will see, eaiser to use. If you want to use a buisness box, that's
fine, do the same thing as I will outline below, but discard the call
waiting part, and make sure you do this after buisness hours.
        The first thing you want to do is check and see if the line has
call waiting, as I said above. If so, that will work MUCH better as you
will see. Okay, first of all you have to decide what type of conferance
you would like. There are three main ones and they are a "Meet Me"
conferance, "PIN Dialin" conferance, and a "You Dial" Conferance.
        The Meet Me is where you get your conferance, and then you tell
AT&T what number to dial, and they will dial those numbers and
establish the conferance like that. These are not that great because if
someone has to hang up the phone or whatever, they can only come back in
if you call them back. Also, the operator may be near, and if you start
talking in aliases and about phreaking and shit, she may fuck you over.
The number to establish a Meet Me conferance is 800-544-6363.
        The Pin Dialin conferance by far is the best. This what most
people use. You call the operator and tell her you would like to
establish a conferance that has a PIN number that you can give out to
your "associates".
        She will need these things (not neccesarily in this order):
          - Your name
          - The phone number it will be billed to
          - What time it will start (Be sure to include your time zone)
          - How Long you will use it for
          - How many ports (people) you will have
       Once you have given her all this, she will say please hold (they
are validating and calculating the PIN number) and then she will come
back on and say she will call you back and give you the validation
numbers. She will then call you back. Now, if you are on a residential
line and they have call waiting, call your friend, and wait for the
phone to beep. That way, those people won't even have a clue as to what
you are doing. She will give you a host PIN, which is the one you use,
and she will give you a user PIN, which you give out to everyone you
know. The number for this is also 800-544-6363.
        The You Dial conferance is good, because there is no live
operator on the line, but you must stay at the phone you initiated the
call from during the whole conferance. This is how this conferance
works: Call 0+700+456+1000 and follow the recorded bitch's
instructions. (Or, read mine, below)
1. Type in the number of ports you are going to need, including your own.
2. Dial the first number
 US: 1+XXX+XXX+XXXX
 INTERNTL:011+COUNTRY#+CITY#+LOCAL#
 When that person answers, press # to add them to the conferance.
3. Keep repeating step 2 for all the people you want on. Then press #
 to add yourself to the conferance.
During Conferance Intiation:
 Dial # To Continue
 Dial * If it's busy, no answer, etc. to continue calling people.
NOTE:
 If you, as the controller, are disconnected from the conferance, HANG
UP. An operator will automatically call you back and reconnect you to
the conferance. (This won't happen if you do it off a fucked buisness
line or whatever)

Other Miscellanious Info
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      If you want to get fancy, hook up three or four lines and then
run them down in the hole you dug. It is easier to do this the first
time then a bunch of times, also. It works really well, and you have
a regular fucking station going.
      Also a good thing to do is switch lines either once every two or
three weeks, or after you put a huge charge on it like a conferance or
something.
      Make sure you are out of site most of the time you are boxing.
Normally people don't care, but some people who are real nosy will come
out and question you. If they do ask you questions, don't awnser any,
pack up your stuff and leave while they are bitching. If they follow
you, lose them of course, but I have never found anyone who has followed
me more than three blocks.
      Your line is also very good to place orders when carding. A lot of
times they will want to call you back, and all you have to do is my
little call waiting trick.

In closing I'd like to thank Black September and L.E. Pirate for the
original Phile on the 0-700 conferance. And, happy boxing!
