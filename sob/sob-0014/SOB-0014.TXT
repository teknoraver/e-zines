    It was a cool Thrusday night, and I had just stopped at the dark
corner of Whitman and Royal.  I pulled out my pack of Winston Selects
and my lighter.  "Plaache," I said as I spit it on to the ground.  A
new pack of cigerettes and the first one was stale.  "Fuckin' bad luck,"
I mumbled to myself as i lit up another one.
    "Can I use your light?"
    I jumped and then causually turned around.  My cigerette froze to my
mouth and my eyes became focused on her chest, like a buzzard about to
attack its prey.
    "Well, I don't have all night."
    I ruffled my hand inside my jeans pocket and pulled out my lighter.
She moved closer to me and caught a peek at her face as I lit her cig.
    "Where are you headed?" she asked, blowing smoke into my face.
    Duh.  "I was headed to go see a movie...."  I quickly made up, not
    telling her I had just gotten kicked out of my house.
    "Oh yeah? Which one?"
    Oh damn it, what is showing?  "Point of No Return, it looks like a
pretty cool movie, so I think I'll go check it out."
    "Cool," she slured as I noticed her tounge bar, "need a ride there?"
    "Yeah, that would be nice."
    "Alright," she smiled, "follow me, my car is this way."
    How could I say no to that?  Had my luck changed for the better or
what?  This girl was about my height, slim build.  Her hair is unique,
short and orangy-red with long bangs tucked behind her ears.
I follow to the side of her, I feel like a god damn dog.
    "This one's mine."  pointing to a jet-black Honda Civic.  We get in.
"So what is your name?"
    "James."
    "Bond?"
    "Blanc, and you are."
    "Oooh sexy, I'm Krista, Krista Pike."
    "Nice to meet you, would you like to join me for that movie."
    "Hmmm. Answer a few more questions first."
    "Okay?"  I thought aloud.
    "What time of music do you like?"
    "Alternative."
    "How old are you?"
    I paused, "17."
    "Are you sure?"
    "Well 19 if you look at my ID."
    "Cool," she giggled "Do you have a girlfriend?"
    "No."
    "Okay, I'll go to the movies with you."
    "How old are you Krista?"
    "23, you are a little young, but you don't look it...." she smiled,
and slowly moved her right hand off the wheel and on to my thigh, and
slowly up to my crotch.
    I stopped her hand with mine, and held it there.  "Let's just
see where the night takes us okay?" and brushed her hand off of my
stiff theigh.
    She smiled, "I can live with that...."  We shortly arrived at the
theater and parked along the side. We walked to the exit door. "Wait
here for a sec...."  The door opened seconds later and a heard of
fat people from Weight Watchers walk out, Lion King must still be
showing I grabbed the door as it went to close.  "Free movies are
more always more fun...." We walked into our theater and sat down.
    "Want some popcorn or something?"
    "That'd be nice," she said.
    I walked out of the theater and mossied my way over to the trash can.
I shnaged 2 cups and a large popcorn.  This theater has free refills.
Nothing free is bad.  Well except maybe diseases, and jokes people tell,
sex? I'll draw the line there....  I went back to my seat, the movie had
started the theater was empty.  We both sat and watched the movie in almost
total silence.  About half way through the show she licked my earlobe and
whispered in my ear.
    "Lets get out of here."
    My hormones woke up from there dead sleep.  "Sure thing."  Six minutes
later we pull up to a house and get out.  "Is this place yours?"
    "No, I'm house sitting for some old friends," she replied.
    We get inside and I follow her into a bedroom.  She pushes me down on
the bed.  Within miliseconds she is on me and my tounge is in her esophagus.
All of sudden she pulls back.
    "Let me change into something more appealing," she softly whispers.
    I can feel my heart pounding as if I'm about to be announced the
ten million dollar publishers clearing house winner.  My dick is so hard
I could knock a tree over.  I check in my wallet and pull out a stack of
condoms and put them on the bedside table.  I hear a movement.  Krista
comes out and cracks a whip down before me.  "Oh shit...." I mumble as
I look at her closer.  She's got a handful of sex toys and edibles, not
to mention her lingere is so hot I could cook eggs on it.
    She jumps climbs atop me and purrs.  Her hand knocks off the small
stack of contraseptives.  "We don't need this kinda shit!" she pauses,
"I swallow."  I can tell you right now this is gonna be the kinkiest
night of my life.
    The next morning I wake up.  Where am I?  Oh shit, now I remember.
I look about the room, Krista is not to be seen.  Oh well I'm drained,
literally.  I get up to go to the bathroom.  I wash my face off and notice
a note.

              James,
                  I hoped you would get this.... How was
                last nite?  I couldn't get enough!  I want
                your cock in my mouth again soon.  Next
                time I won't let you off so easy.  Sorry
                I didn't wanna wake you this morning.  You
                can let yourself out the unlocked back door,
                don't worry about locking it.

                                     Love,

                                       Krista

                P.S.  If you want some real pussy meet me
                      tonite at Night Lights coffee shop
                      on Snapper St. @ 8:30....



    I must admit, she is the goddess of kinky.  I need a car.
