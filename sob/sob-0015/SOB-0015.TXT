"One last drag.." I said as I inhaled deeply on my
diminishing cigarette. I threw it down and crushed it with my well
polished combat boots, and walked inside. My dog greeted me and
whined, staring at the door I just came through.
        "You wanna go outside boy? Okay, come on."
        As I stepped outside the scent of something sweet rushed into
my lungs.. something I couldn't quite place.
        "No matter" I thought, and strode into the half illuminated
culdisac in front of my house. I watched, as if from a distance, as
my dog attempted to mark the bushes around my neighbor's home as his
own. As I wander closer to my dog, I noticed a movement out of the
corner of my eye. Something tall, something dark. I slowly turned my
head towards the object, and the silhouette of a man in a trench coat
came into my sight. The mans face suddenly was illuminated in a
fierce red glow as he took a drag of a cigarette.
        "Come here often?" He said and then burst into a sadistic gale
of laughter.
        "Who the fuck are you?" I said.
        "Why I'm the devil, Aaron. And I've come to posses your soul."
        "Shut the fuck up before I kill your stupid fucking worthless ass."
        "Okay, I was just kidding, I'm not the Devil, but I know him
_real_ well Aaron. He and I go WAY back.. back almost to the dawn of
time."
        "What kinda crazy fuck are you anyway? And how do you know my
name? Did the boys at work put you up to this?"
        "I know what you think, Aaron. I know that when you walked
outside after you went in you smelled something strange. Ain't that
right?"
        "Yeah, how the fuck did you know that?"
        "You know what that smell was?"
        "Who the fuck are you?"
        "That was your blood. Dripping down from your neck to your toes.
Coating your body in a thick red layer of loveliness. Take a look, I'm
sure it's still there."
        I glanced down, and he was right. My entire body was now covered
in blood.

        I screamed.

        My eyes opened to blackness, and my head began to swim. I tried
to sit up, but couldn't for some reason. I looked around, and realized I
was staring at the sky. It was still nighttime, and I could see the
planet of Mars right above me, the sky's red cigarette cherry. I
listened for sounds of the man and, hearing none, tried to move. It was
only then that I realized I had no feeling in any part of my body. I
tried to move, but couldn't raise my head to look at my feet. I was in a
permanent gaze towards the stars.

        I screamed.

        Or my mind screamed. I heard no sound, and neither did anyone
else. The world was finally silent.
