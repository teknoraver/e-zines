              Tenet - What It Is And How To Use And Abuse It
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
One of friends knew an assitant principal at NEISD. He came home one day with a
number for his modem that logged into a strange system that he had never seen
before. Granted, he didn't hack much at the time, but he knows what most systems
look like. He said it was a UNIX system with a menu shell around it. Naturally I
was curiuos, so I dialed it up when he was over at my house one day just to
check it out. I couldn't really figure out anything that he didn't already know,
and noticed that it was hooked up to Internet. This really caught my attention
because the latest thing with me was how to access the Internet. I asked him to
look more into it and he said he would, and a few days later he called me up. He
said "Check this out! I found out how to FTP and Telnet out of this thing!" I
was like, yeah big deal, I know a million places that do that. Then he said
"Yeah, it's like all the rest except it's a 16.8 Dual Standard dialin." Now this
really got my attention, because I was tired of downloading on a 9600 line at
500 CPS. So, we did a rundown on the thing. Here's what we came up with :

Name : Tenet - Texas Education Network
Dialin : FTP or Telnet 128.83.185.91 (Tenet.Edu) or phone at :
Austin                  (512)472-0602       Fort Worth     (817)795-2902

Brownsville             (210)542-6295       Houston        (713)790-1441
Bryan/Collage Station   (409)862-2577       Lubbock        (806)741-0028

      Anywhere           (800)258-3638 or (800)25-TENET

Accesses : FTP, Tenet, Internet Mail, And a variety of other Texas education
           bullshit.
Doesn't Access : You cannot use IRC, CC (C Compiler) and there are no Usenet
                 feeds. You cannot compile anything, so there's a big drawback.

How To Get An Account
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I guess you can figure out how to get one - but in case you're REALLY stupid,
I'll fill you in on the ones I find extremely easy.

1. Card it. Not hard at all - you need a drop site for they mail you your
   password and validation notice.
2. Social Engineer it. This is probably the best way. First, card yourself an
   account, and then get on and use the command "who" (without quotes) from
   the shell. This will allow you to see whose online, and whatever information
   they are willing to give out. (I.G. Name, Phone Number, Address, ETC.) If
   they do not give out much, you can also "finger" their account, this will
   also list a lot about them. Then call 'em up and get their shit.
3. Hack 'em. This is by far the hardest. None of the defaults work - although
   the root account works, it only allows login at the local end. You could do
   it if you have a good dictionary - unfortuanetly I don't.
4. Pay for it. (If you're reading this section and interested, go kill yourself)
   The only good I could see coming out of that is if you really ARE a teacher
   or you are interested in a STABLE message point on Internet.

Tips
-=-=-
1. Don't ever use your real handle. Take normal safety precautions. You know
  the deal.
2. If you are logging in as an Public or Private school teacher, administrator,
  etc. you must know a county-district number of a school. This is a unique
  number which identifies your County, School district and campus. It looks
  something like 123-456-789. If you do not know your cdn, you must shnag it
  before you can complete the registration for that account. It can be 6 or 9
  digits.
3. Leave NO trace of your presence behind. If you downloaded a file of an FTP
  or something, don't leave it in the user's workspace. The user may become
  suspicious of files called HACKINGGOVERNMENT.COMPUTERS. Remember : you get
  unlimited time online and the file will be on the FTP or whatever tommarrow.

Okay, well that's the scoop. Have fun, and if you need a Texas school code
Email me on any board or at lmb@tenet.edu. Other than that - have fun.
