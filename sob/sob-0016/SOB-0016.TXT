<Intro by REGEL>        

  Well, folks, the creator of the infrared box has another text phile for you.
Well, you have seen beige boxes before, so you are probably wondering why I am
doing another one. Well, it seems as though all of the other philes never 
include the monitor mode and the polarity indicator that the linemans handset 
has. If you are not familiar with those added features, the monitor mode allows 
you to tap someone elses fone line and listen in on their calls, and the 
polarity indicator shows if the line is canceled, or if you have the alligator 
clips reversed. BY READING FURTHER ON INTO THIS TEXT FILE, YOU RELEAVE REGEL OR 
ANYONE ELSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS. 
                                               

                Parts Required
        (all available from Radio Shack)
            --------------------        
             1 - One piece phone
             1 - Red LED 
             1 - Green LED
             1 - 1K (1000) ohm resister (color bands are brown, black, red)
             1 - push button
             1 - 1000 ohm to 8 ohm audio transformer
             1 - .47uf(micro farad) 250 volt capacitor
             1 - DPDT toggle switch
             2 - alligator clips
             X - some wire


          ASSEMBLY OF UNIT
          ----------------

        First, the monitor feature:

        1.  Disconnect the ring(red) line from the phone circuit board and
            connect it to the center pole of one side of the switch.
            (see diagram is confused)

        2.  Run a wire from one leg of the same side as the center pole of
            step #1 to the point on the phone circuitry where the ring used
            to be.

        3.  Connect one side of the capacitor to the remaining leg on that
            same side.

        4.  Connect the other lead of the capacitor to the blue wire of the
            transformer.

        5.  Connect the black wire of the transformer to the phone circuit 
            board where the tip(green) connection is.

        6.  Connect the white wire of the transformer to one of the earpiece
            terminals.(it doesn't matter which one)

        7.  Disconnect the other speaker wire from the phone circuit board 
            and connect it to the free center pole on the switch.

        8.  Connect the red transformer wire to the leg on the switch next 
            to the leg where the capacitor joins.

        9.  The last leg on the switch should be connected to where the 
            speaker wire was removed from the phone circuit board.

        10. Do the Polarity indicator instructions.


        Second, the polarity indicator:

        1.  Connect the anode(long wire) of the green LED to the cathode
            (short wire) of the red LED.  Connect the cathode of the green
            LED to the anode of the red LED.

        2.  Connect one end of the resistor to the ring line on the phone,
            and the other end to one leg of the pushbutton.

        3.  Connect the other leg of the pushbutton to the anode of the green
            LED.

        4.  Connect the phone tip line to the cathode of the green LED.


          USE OF UNIT
          -----------

        To use the unit connect the alligator clips to a red and black wire 
        and then to the appropriate terminals on the phones ring and tip.
        Then connect them to the terminals on a trunk and push the button.  
        If the green LED lights up, then the clips are connected properly.  If
        the red LED lights up, then the clips and reversed.  To use the monitor
        mode, connect the beige box up properly and then flip the switch.  In
        one position the phone works like a regular phone, but in the other
        position, it monitors the line, in essance, a phone tap.  This means
        that you hear what is going on exactly on the line.  You won't hear
        a dialtone unless a person on the line you are tapping picks up their
        phone.  In monitor mode you can hear all, but say nothing.  That about
        convers it all.
