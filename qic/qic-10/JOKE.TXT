                        IMPORTANT INFORMATION


Ameritech is alerting the Hispanic community to a telephone fraud scheme that
has been operating in the Indianapolis area.

The individuals involved in the illegal scheme are posing as Ameritech and 
other telephone company employees when calling customers to gain access to 
personal telephone account information. They may even ask that you call them 
back with the requested information by dialing special codes followed by a 
local or long-distance calls that are charged to your telephone number.

To protect yourself, please remember that it is not normal policy for a 
telephone company, including Ameritech, to call you and request information 
about your telephone account. Nor do telephone companies routinely call 
customers to "test telephone lines."

If you receive a suspicious phone call or notice calls you did not make on
your phone bill, please call your Ameritech service representative toll-free
at 556-4200 during normal business office hours.
