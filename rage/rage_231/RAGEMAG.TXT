 "Cyberspace Hacker Gangs Gain Revenge on Author"

- Joshua Quittner's book exposed the hacker war, so they took over his phone  
  line, voice mail, and filled his on-line account with messages.
  
	In his forthcoming book, "Masters of Deception:  Gang Wars in 
Cyberspace, "writer Joshua Quittner chronicles the bizarre but true tale of a 
Harfiled-and-McCoys feud in the nether world of computer hackers.  Now the 
hackers have extracted revenge for Quittner's attention, taking control of 
his phone line and voice mail and bombarding his online account with thousands 
of messages.  
	To wreak their hacker havoc, they broke into computer systems run by 
Sprint Corp., International Business Machines Corp., and Pipeline, which 
provides Internet access to consumers.  Billing themselves as the Internet 
Liberation Front, the pranksters have warned corporate America to get out of 
cyberspace, declaring war "on any company suspected of contributing to the 
demise of the Internet."  The antics and break-ins underscore the security 
risks as companies seek a presence on the Internet, and point up how difficult 
it is to stop hackers from going where they please.  
	"I don't believe I've ever been hacked to this degree," said Quittner, 
whose book, written with his wife, Michelle Slatalla, was excerpted in the 
latest issue of Wired magazine, apparently prompting the attack.  The article 
and book tell of the Long Island hacker gang Masters of Deception and its 
"war" with a rival break-in group, the Legion of Doom.  
	"People in MOD and LOD are very unhappy about the story," Quittner says. 
"This is what I believe prompted this whole thing."  During the Thanksgiving 
weekend, the offended computer prowlers took command of Quittner's phone line 
and forwarded it to an out-of-state answering machine, substituting his 
greeting with a profane message of their own.  One former MOD member was able 
to patch through a call to someone claiming to be a member of the Internet 
Liberation Front.  He, in turn, played the messages left by Quittner's friends 
and family on the bogus answering machine they had set up.  The messages 
included a call from Quittner's mother asking about her grandchildren and 
noting, "I think you ought to check your answering message." Another came 
from Quittner himself, after he realized he'd been had:  "Very funny, guys."  
	The group also zapped tens of thousands of messages to his E-Mail 
account, as well as about 1,000 messages to the mailbox of Wired magazine.  
The messages came from computers owned by IBM, Sprint, and Pipeline.  Hackers 
had broken in and installed a script to fire off the Internet Liberation 
Front message to Quittner every five seconds.  The "mail bombs" were "probably 
closely related to the Quittner article," said Ian McFarland, a Wired engineer.  
Sprint had to shut down several computers for about four hours, a company 
spokesperson said.  "I don't know if it's an organized group," he said of the 
Internet Liberation Front.  "We never heard of them before."  The Masters of 
Deception was a notorious gang of clever New York teens whose on-line pranks 
landed four of them in jail.  In Quittner's book, he sympathetically tells the 
story of young hackers who, in their quest for knowledge, go too far.  "A 
number of them got sent to jail when they should have been sent to college," 
he said.  
	In 1992, MOD was charged with tampering or stealing passwords to gain 
services from computers at the former Southwestern Bell Corp., now SBC 
Communications; British Telecommunications PLC's North American subsidiary, 
BT North America; TRW Inc., and NYNEX Corp., among others.

	Last summer, Intel discovered a flaw in their new Pentium processor 
which caused errors in some floating-point calculations.  Since the chances 
of an error were slim, with a 1 in 5 million chance of an error occurring, 
the famed microprocessor chip corporation decided to wait to fix the error 
until the fall of 1994.  All they had to do was add one instruction.    
	Intel recently took responsibility for the error and has announced a 
free replacement Pentium chip for all customers.  The total number of Pentium 
processor owners worldwide tops 2 million, putting quite a burden and an 
expense on Intel.    
	The biggest concern is for scientists in the fields of research and 
development who rely heavily on ultimate accuracy and speed in their 
computers. Normal games and word processor programs could not be affected in 
a large way by the Floating-point Division (FDIV) bug.  Instead, government 
agencies, businesses, and laboratories are more prone to disaster due to 
their direct reliance on exact calculations.  The fact that the Pentium 
processor is supposed to be the fastest and most advanced microprocessor for 
Personal Computers causes those who need the speed and power to rush out, 
pick up a Pentium system, and expect it to be inperfect condition.  No one 
would think it would be necessary to check their calculations elsewhere.  
	Intel has created a disaster for themselves, and in the future, who will 
make the chips for the PC's?  For many years, there has seemed to be a 
monopoly of sorts in the PC world.  You get an IBM or compatible system, and 
what often comes with it?  Microsoft software and Intel processors.  Due to 
this incident alone, the PC world may have lost their faith in the Intel 
products.
	Below is a C++ source code for a program to check a pentium chip to 
see if it has the FDIV bug. It has been distributed since the bug was announced, 
and its author is unknown.

	When launching Pathways Into Darkness for the Macintosh for the first 
time, it will ask you to enter a specific monster sequence that can be found 
in the original manual (on the bottom of the pages).  But seeing how you 
wouldn't need this text file if you had the REAL manual I guess I'll have to 
give them to you!  In order to do this right the first time your gonna have 
to know a few things about how the manual is setup.  In order to beat the 
copy protection you have to click on FOUR monsters upon the initial startup 
of Pathways.  There are more than FOUR monsters displayed, but you ONLY have 
to click on FOUR.  Alright in the REAL manual there are sets of FOUR monsters 
on the right and left sides of each page starting from page #1 and finally 
ending on page #19.  Below are a bunch of descriptions I made up for you to 
identify each monster, a key that I made up so you will know which monster is 
which, and a listing of all the monsters IN ORDER on each page of the 
original manual. 

Descriptions --

Headless - No head, only a large tongue sticking out surrounded by teeth.
Ooze - The faceless dude with an open stomach that looks like a mouth.
Nightmare - That fishy looking thing with wiskers and beady eyes.
Ghoul - The hunchback guy that's wearing a loincloth.
Zombie - The skeleton dood that looks egyptian.
Skitter - The only one there that resembles a spider.

      The USA is running out of telephone numbers.  Talks have circulated of 
updating the existing phone switching system to accomodate new customers as 
well as old customers.  The current system has some interesting limitations 
"designed" into it.  For example, all area codes must have a middle digit of
0 or 1.  This limits the maximum area codes to 162.  In a sense it is good, 
because it prevents the phone companies from ripping us off.  Though, in a 
recent issue of 2600 magazine, some new area codes have been created which 
donot use the conventional system.  Their middle digits can be any number, so 
it looks as though changes have begun in some areas.  The actual phone number 
itself is limited to 7 digits, which allows for 1,000,000 possibilities per 
area code.  This is only true if the number 000-0000 is to be used, though.
	The new system would probably increase the number of digits in a phone 
number to 8.  How would this change occur though?  After midnight, your 
newphone number will be xxx-xxxxx?  Or, as they notate it in France, 
xx-xx-xx-xx? One thing is for sure, it will cost a lot to make the new system 
user-friendly. For example, if you dial a wrong number nowadays, a 
cyber-bitch will inform you that "That number is not in service," or maybe 
"The number you have reached, ...has been changed.  The new number is..."
Will that be set up forthe entire new system?  Imagine the kind of money it 
will take for these kinds of changes.  The fact that everyone will have a new 
phone number will totally cut off communications for an extended period of 
time.  Automated phone services will have to be reprogrammed.  Computer 
software may become outdated or useless.  It's an overlooked detail as to how 
much we rely on the phone system to stay the same as it is.  Now, think of 
the easy way out.  Higher rates, less customers, no need to change the 
existing system.  With the increased interest in modem communications, fax 
services, answering machines, and multi-line businesses, it is expected that 
the demand for a phone line will continue to increase, and in many cases, the 
demand will have nothing to do with the cost of service.  
	On the other hand, if the government prevents the rates and fees from 
going out of hand, the phone system will need to be changed, but how will it 
be funded if the prices can't be raised?  There's jobs to protect, too.  It 
seems likely that as time goes on, the existing phone system in the USA will 
slowly meet its downfall. Perhaps an independent group of investors will 
attempt to create their own system, with some kind of access to the existing 
lines.  Who knows what the future will bring?

idea since many of the AT&T operators direct numbers are in this range.).  
Well, I got probably about 9000 numbers through it, when suddenly all the 
tones quit appearing...  And I was rather surprised since the tones normally 
pick up in the high ranges.  I tried to call a known working number, and was 
suddenly greeted by a wonderful intercept message stating that "1-800-555-
1212" was not available from my calling area...  Since "1-800-555-1212" (last 
time I checked) was the number for information I began to wonder what was 
going on.  
	I called my local phone company, they sent me to AT&T, they said 
call local repair.  Local repair told me to call AT&T repair.  I called them, 
and they said that the number I was trying to dial was not available (I gave 
them a "1-800-222" number instead of information.)  The kind operator then 
told me to call her direct over an "800" number, I hung up dialed it, and got 
the intercept message.
	I guess this just goes to show that if you fuck with AT&T they'll be 
real dicks and cut your calls to FREE numbers that you can call from 
anywhere.  Even though they never say that you CAN'T call all the "800" 
numbers you want, when it gets down to it, they get pissed and yank your 
access...  (Hmm...  Is that unconstitutional?)  Dunno...  Oh well...  But 
until I get full access back and an explanation of why I am not able to call 
"800" numbers I'm switching to MCI.  

(THREE DAYS LATER)  

	AT&T said they will give me my 800 numbers back after an all day run 
around.  Said there computer figured something weird was going on when my 
line dialed over 79 "1-800" numbers between 3:30 and 5:00 in the morning.  
(Hmm...  Now I need a new war dialer that slows down in the early morning.)

LATE UPDATE: 

Here is a copy of the letter sent to me and received on June 21, 1994:

<Name Withheld> 
46 N. Somewhere Ave. 
Somewhere, FU  49666 
(212) 781-6012

Dear <Name Withheld>,

	AT&T has reason to believe that the telephone list to you has been used 
in violation of Federal Communications Commission - AT&T Tariff F.C.C. No. 2 
Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4.C.  These tariff sections prohibit using WATS to 
harass another, using WATS to interfere with the use of the service by others 
and using WATS with the intent of gaining access to a WATS Customer's 
outbound calling capabilities on an unauthorized basis.
	Accordingly, AT&T has temporarily restricted your telephone service's 
ability to place AT&T 800 Service calls in accordance to Section 2.8.2 of the 
above tariff.  If the abusive calling reoccurs after AT&T lifts the temporary 
restriction, the restriction will be reimposed until AT&T is satisfied that 
you have undertaken steps to secure your number against future tariff 
violations.
	You should also note that unauthorized possession or use of access codes 
can constitute a violation of United States Criminal Code - Title 18, Section 
1029, which carries a penalty of up to $10,000 fine and up to 10 years 
imprisonment for first time offenders.  Any future activity from telephones 
listed to you may be referred to federal law enforcement officials.
	If you wish to discuss this restriction, you may do so in writing to 
AT&T Corporate Security, Dept. 19, P.O. Box 6735, Bridgewater, N.J. 
08807-9998, or you may call 908-725-6973.  *(What?  No "1-800" number?)*

<End Letter>

And just to be a nice guy...  I'll publish my results...  See the end of this 
file...

Remember they said specifically:  FROM YOUR LINES...  <Evil Grin>  

The moral of this stupid fucking story:  AT&T gets very angry when you war 
dial 9000 "1-800" numbers...  So be sure to do it from a friends house...  
And BTW:  I never used a code...  Not an AT&T one...  An out dial a few 
times...  But not AT&T...

			À³ÄÄ Ä ùùú  ú ú úùù Ä\ÄÄÄÙ        

Reprinted by Grendel (An oldie but goody, a terrorist bomb still in use.) 

Stuff you'll need:  

One glass jar. 
One bag of pellet feed (usually green in color, used to feed pet rodents). 
Two tubes of modeling cement.
Last but not least you'll need some gasoline.  

Manufacturing the bomb:  

	Powder up enough of the pet food to fill the glass jar halfway.  Empty 
the two tubes of model cement into the jar and mix thoroughly.  Now fill the 
rest of the jar with gasoline.  Put the cap on the jar and shake.  Put a fuse 
through the top of the jar.  Light the fuse.  THEN RUN LIKE HELL!!  DIVE TO 
THE GROUND!!

	This bomb will KILL you if you are not out of range of the blast.  (The 
range of the blast depends solely on how big the bomb is.  50 feet and some 
cover should suffice as a safe distance for most bombs).  

A note from Grendel on fuses:

	Go to your local gun show and buy REAL fuse.  Most gun shows around the 
country sell fuse that are safe and fail proof.  In fact they may even sell 
different grades of fuse, some may burn quicker than others.  Another note 
these very same gun shows will sell gunpowder to just about anyone.  You may 
also find electric fuses and starters, they tend to be army surplus and sell 
for about $50.00 and up.  Of course gun shows are a great place to buy rifles 
and shotguns.  Also are the wide selections of knives, swords, rapiers, 
machetes and various other cutlery.  In fact 60 minutes (Or was it 48 hours?) 
just had a feature about gun shows around the country and how gun dealers 
sell to just about anyone.  They showed some guy buying handguns and assault 
rifles without a license.  :)  

DISCLAIMER: 

	I take no responsibility on any damage or injuries the above information 
may cause.  If some dumbshit kills 30 people with the bomb I outlined above 
then he's more fucked up than me and should get the death penalty.  If some
deranged fool blows up part of a school or takes out his enemy's house with 
this bomb isn't because of me.  If some pissed off dude kidnaps his 
ex-girlfriend, ties her up, puts the bomb between her skank legs, lights the 
fuse, and watches from a safe distance as the explosion blows her to pieces; 
its not my fault that he's fucked up or that she's a slut that cheated on him 
then left him broken hearted.  

In other words:  I DON'T GIVE A FLYING MONKEY FUCK!  FUCK YOU!

ÃÄÄÄùú           "Can you feel the RaGE?" "RaGE? No, passion!"          úùÄÄÄ´

		   ú úùÄ³¿  Gelled Flame Fuels  À³Äùú ú  
			À³ÄÄ Ä ùùú  ú ú úùù Ä\ÄÄÄÙ        

	Gelled or paste type fuels commonly known or referred to as "Napalm" are 
often preferable to raw gasoline for use in incendiary devices such as fire 
bottles (Moltov Cocktails).  This type fuel adheres more readily to the 
target and produces a greater heat concentration.  Several methods are shown 
below for transfering ordinary gasoline into a gelled fuel using commonly 
available materials.  The methods are divided into the following categories 
based on the major ingredient:

Lye Systems --

	Lye (also known as caustic soda or Sodium Hydroxide) can be used in 
combination with powdered rosin or castor oil to gel gasoline for use as a 
flame fuel which will adhere to target surfaces.  This fuel isn't suitable 
for use in the chemical (Sulphuric Acid) type of fire bottle.  The acid will 
react with the lye and break down the gel.

Lye-Alcohol Systems --

	Lye can be used in combination with alcohol (Ethyl alcohol would be the 
best choice, but Methyl (wood) alcohol or Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol can be 
used as substitutes; this produces softer gels though.) and any of the several 
fats listed below to gel gasoline for use as a flame fuel.  Once again don't 
try using this fuel with the chemical fire bottle.  A reaction will occur 
causing the gel to break down.     

	The following can be used as fats to gel the gasoline:     
	
	(a)  Castor oil (good)     
	(b)  Any vegetable oil (corn, cottonseed, peanut, linseed, etc.)     
	(c)  Any fish oil     
	(d)  Butter or margarine
	
	It's necessary when using (b) to (d) to double the amount of fat 
	and lye for satisfactory bodying.

WARNING:  Do NOT use an aluminum container when making the 2 gelled fuels 
listed above!  If you do decide to disobey my instructions, have phun wiping 
an acid like substance off of your burnt face.  Uhh...  You see lye will 
react violently when mixed with aluminum and water.  The result is a very hot 
chemical reaction which produces a flammable Hydrogen gas (Ahh...  Gives you 
some kewl ideas huh?).

Soap-Alcohol Systems --

	Commonly used household soap (not laundry detergent) can be used in 
combination with alcohol to gel gasoline for use as a flame fuel which will 
also adhere to target surfaces.  Unless the word "soap" actually appears 
somewhere on the container or wrapper, the washing compound is probably a 
detergent.  THESE CANNOT BE USED!

Egg Systems --

	The WHITE of any bird egg can be used to gel gasoline.  Don't get the 
yellow egg yolk mixed into the egg whites.  If the yellow portion of the egg 
gets into the egg white then discard the egg.  You MUST also add ONE of the 
following ingredients:  Table salt, ground coffee, dried tea leaves, cocoa, 
sugar, potassium nitrate, epsom salts, washing soda, baking soda, or aspirin.

Latex Systems --

	Any milky white plant fluid is a potential source of latex which can be 
used to gel gasoline.  One of the following acids must be added too:  Acetic 
acid, sulfuric acid, or hydrochloric acid.  Don't get the acids on your skin 
dumbfucks, it's not phun!

Wax Systems --

	Any of several common waxes can be used to gel gasoline for use as a 
flame fuel.  Any of the following will do the trick when it comes to waxes:  
Candles, crayons, furniture and floor waxes, artificial fruit and flowers, 
wax paper, etc...

Animal Blood Systems --

	Animal blood can be used to gel gasoline.  Okay all of you satanists out 
there go and get your devil worship groupies, kill a deer and save some of 
that sacrificial blood for this project!  Heh.  You MUST also add ONE of the 
following ingredients:  Table salt, ground coffee, dried tea leaves, sugar, 
lime, epsom salts, or baking soda.

	Personally I have found that styrofoam works well too...  A bit sticky 
but if your in a pinch then this might help you out!  Have phun!  Latz...

	Mercury Fulminate is used as a primary explosive in the fabrication of
detonators.  It's to be used with a booster explosive such as picric acid
(see other text files) or RDX...

Material Required --

Nitric Acid, 90% concentrate. (1.48 sp. gr.)  Can be found in industrial
metal processors, and chemical supply stores.

Mercury - Can be found in thermometers, mercury switches, old radio tubes,
chemical supply stores, etc.

Ethyl (grain) alcohol (90%)
Filtering material - Paper towels, etc.

Teaspoon measure (1/4, 1/2, and 1 teaspoon capacity) - aluminum, or stainless
steel.

Heat source
Clean wooden stick
Clean water
Glass containers
Tape
Syringe

Procedure --

1.  Dilute 5 teaspoons of nitric acid with 2-1/2 teaspoons of clean water in
a glass conatainer by adding the acid to the water.

2.  Dissolve 1/8 teaspoons of mercury in the diluted nitric acid.  This will
produce dark red fumes.

NOTE:  It may be necessary to add water, one drop at a time, to the mercury-
acid solution in order to start the reaction.

CAUTION:  Acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is spilled, wash
it away with a large quantity of water.  DO NOT INHALE THE FUMES!

3.  Warm 10 teaspoons of the alcohol in a container until the alcohol feels
warm to the inside of your wrist.

4.  Pour the metal-acid solution into the warm alcohol.  A reaction should
start in less than 5 minutes.  Dense white fumes will be given off during the
reaction.  As time passes, the fumes will become less dense.  Allow 10 to 15
minutes to complete the reaction.  Fulminate will settle to the bottom.

CAUTION:  The reaction generates large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes.
The process must be conducted outdoors or in a well ventilated area, away
from sparks or open flames.  DO NOT INHALE FUMES!

5.  Filter the solution through a paper towel into a container.  Crystals may
stick to the side of the conatainer.  If so, tilt and squirt water down the
sides of the container until all of the material collects on the filter
paper.

6.  Wash the crystals with 6 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol.

7.  Allow these mercury fulminate crystals to air dry.

CAUTION:  Handle the dry explosive with GREAT care.  Do not scrape or handle
it roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flames.  Store in a cool, dry
place.

and work into a paste.

2.  Add approximately 1/3 to 1/2 cup of alcohol (100 milliliters) to the 
aspirin paste; stir while pouring.

3.  Filter the alcohol-aspirin solution through a paper towel into another 
glass container.  Discard the solid left on the paper towel.

4.  Pour the filtered solution into a ceramic or glass dish.

5.  Evaporate the alcohol and water from the solution by placing the dish 
into a pan of hot water.  White powder will remain in the dish after 
evaporation.  The water in the pan should be at hot bath temperature, not 
boiling, approximately 160 to 180 degrees fahrenheit.  It shouldn't burn the 
hands.

6.  Pour 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of concentrated sulfuric acid into a 
canning jar.  Add the white powder to the sulfuric acid.

7.  Heat canning jar of sulfuric acid in a pan of simmering hot water bath 
for 15 minutes; then remove the jar from the bath.  Solution will turn to a 
yellow-orange color.

8.  Add 3 level teaspoons (15 grams) of potassium nitrate in three portions 
to the yellow-orange solution; stir vigorously during additions.  The 
solution will turn red, and then back to a yellow-orange color.

9.  Allow the solution to cool to a normal room temperature while stirring 
occasionally.

10.  Slowly pour the solution, while stirring, into 1-1/4 cup (300 
milliliters) of cold water and allow to cool.

11.  Filter the solution through a paper towel into a glass container.  Light 
yellow particles will collect on the paper towel.

12.  Wash the light yellow particles with 2 tablespoons (25 milliliters) of

	"Red or White Powder" Propellant may be prepared in a fairly simple, and 
safe manner.  The formulation described below will result in approximately 
2-1/2 pounds of powder.  This is a small arms propellant and should only be 
used in weapons with 1/2 inch inside diameter or less.  DO NOT use in pistols!

Material Required --

Heat source (Kitchen stove or open fire)
2 gallon metal bucket
Measuring cup (8 ounces)
Wooden spoon or rubber spatula
Metal sheet or aluminum foil (at least 18 inches square)
Flat window screen (at least 1 foot square)
Potassium Nitrate (granulated) 2-1/3 cups
White sugar (granulated) 2 cups
Powdered ferric oxide (rust) 1/8 cup (if available)
Clear water, 3-1/2 cups

Procedure --

1.  Place the sugar, potassium nitrate, and water in the bucket, Heat with a 
low flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and potassium nitrate 
dissolve.

2.  If available, add the ferric oxide (rust) to the solution.  Increase the 
flame under the mixture until it boils gently.  The mixture will retain the 
rust coloration.

3.  Stir and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture is 
reduced to one quarter of its original volume, then stir continuously.

4.  As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker until it reaches 
the consistency of cooked breakfast cereal or homemade fudge.  At this stage 
of thickness, remove the bucket from the heat source, and spread the mass on 
the metal sheet.

5.  While the material cools, score it with the spoon or spatula in 
crisscrossed furrows about 1 inch apart.

6.  Allow the material to air dry, preferably in the sun.  As it dries, 
rescore it occasionally (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.

7.  When the material has dried to a point where it's moist and soft but not 
sticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the screen.  Rub the material 
back and forth against the screen mesh with a spoon or other flat instrument 
until the material is granulated into small worm-like particles.

8.  After granulation, return the material to the sun to dry completely.

	A spring type clothespin can be used to make a circuit closing switch to 
activate explosive charges, mines, booby traps, and alarm systems.   

Material Required --

Spring type clothespin.
Solid copper wire -- 1/16 in.  (2 mm) in diameter.
Strong string or wire.
Flat piece of wood (roughly 1/8 x 1" x 2").
Knife

Procedure --

1.  Strip four inches (10 cm) of insulation from the ends of 2 solid copper 
wires.  Scrape the copper wires with the knife until the metal is shiny.

2.  Wind one scraped wire tightly on one jaw of the clothespin, and the other 
wire on the other jaw.

3.  Make a hole in one end of the flat piece of wood using a knife, heated 
nail or a drill.  Tie the strong string or wire through the hole.

4.  Place the flat piece of wood between the jaws of the clothespin switch.

Basic Firing Circuit --

	Attach one of your leads coming off of the clothespin switch directly to 
the negative terminal of your battery.  Attach the other lead on the switch 
directly to one of leads coming off of your initiator (i.e. blasting cap).  
Make sure the small piece of wood is separating both jaws on your clothespin!  
Now connect the remaining terminal on your intiator and the positive terminal 
on your battery with a piece of wire.  When the flat piece of wood is removed 
by pulling the string, the jaws of the clothespin will close thus completing 
the circuit.

CAUTION:  Do not attach the battery until the switch and the trip wire have 
been planted and examined.  Be sure the flat piece of wood is separating the 
jaws of the switch.

Usage --

	Drive a small headed nail through the spring hole and attaching it to a 
stake of some sort (the clothespin MUST turn freely on the nail).  Attach 
your trip wire to the small wooden block by means of the hole, and run it 
over a path, tie the other end of the tripcord to a tree or a large plant.  
Use your imagination!

slighty.  Tie the rope to a tree, bush, or stake.

4.  Drive another nail into the board near the tip of the knife blade.  
Connect the two nails with a piece of conductive wire.  The nail should be 
positioned so that it will contact the second nail when the blade is pulled 
about 1 inch (2-1/2 cm) to the side.  Check the position of the nails to the 
knife blade.  The nails should be placed so that the knife blade will contact 
either one when the rope is pulled or released.

Usage --

	Attach one wire from the firing circuit to one of the nails and the 
other to the knife blade.  The circuit will be completed when the tripcord is 
pulled or released.  Use your imagination!

			À³ÄÄ Ä ùùú  ú ú úùù Ä\ÄÄÄÙ        

	A common mousetrap can be used to make a circuit closing switch for 
electrically initiated explosives, mines and other miscellaneous booby traps.

Material Required --

Mousetrap
A hack saw or a small file.
Some good connecting wires.

Procedure --

1.  Remove the trip lever from the mousetrap using the hack saw or file.  
Also remove the small staple and holding wire.

2.  Retract the striker of the mousetrap and attach the trip lever across the 
end of the wood base using the staple that was removed previously.  If the 
trip lever isn't made of metal, a piece of metal of approximately the same 
size should be used.

3.  Strip one inch (2-1/2 cm) of insulation from the ends of 2 good 
connecting wires.

4.  Wrap one wire tightly around the spring loaded striker of the mousetrap.

5.  Wrap the second wire around some part of the trip lever or the improvised 
piece of metal.  If a soldering iron is available, solder both of the wires 
in place.

Usage --

	This switch can be used in a number of ways -- one typical method is 
described below:

		The switch can be placed inside a box which also contains the 
	explosive and batteries.  The spring loaded striker is held back by the 
	lid of the box and when the box is opened the circuit closes!  Haha!

		   ú úùÄ³¿ The Pull-Loop Switch À³Äùú ú  
			À³ÄÄ Ä ùùú  ú ú úùù Ä\ÄÄÄÙ        

	This switch will initiate explosive charges, mines, and booby traps when 
a trip wire is pulled.

Material Required --

2 good lengths of insulated wire.
A sharp knife and or a pair of wire strippers.
A good amount of strong string or cord.
Some fine thread that will break easily.

Procedure --

1.  Remove about 2 inches of insulation from one end of each length of wire.  
Scrape the bare wire with a knife until the metal is shiny.

2.  Make a loop out of each piece of bare wire.

3.  Thread each wire through the loop of the other wire so the wires can 
slide along each other.  The loops should contact each other when the two 
wires are pulled tight.

Usage --

1.  Seperate the loops by about 2 inches.  Tie a piece of fine thread around 
the wires near each loop.  The thread should be tight enough to support the 
loops and the wire, yet fine enough that it will break under a very slight 
pull.

2.  Fasten one wire to a tree or stake and connect the end of it to a firing 
curcuit.

3.  Tie a piece of cord or string around the other piece of wire a few inches 
from the loop.  Tie the free end of the cord around a tree, bush, or stake.  
Connect the free end of the wire to the firing circuit.  Initiation will 
occur when the tripcord is pulled.

CAUTION:  Be sure that the loops do not touch each other when the wires are 
connected to the firing circuit.

Other Uses --

	The switch without the fine thread may be used to activate a booby trap 
by attaching it between the lid and a rigid portion of a box, between a door 
and a door jamb, and in similar manners.  Use your imagination!

	In recent times, there has been something terribly wrong with the 
Internet.  Large numbers of inexperienced users have climbed on the net, 
hoping to get a taste of the "Information Superhighway."  They are the people 
willing to pay a monthly fee for access to internet services, whether direct 
or indirect; and in most cases, not knowing the difference.  Needless to say, 
those who have been on the net for some time simply hate to see these people.  
They are a distraction, and their lack of knowledge on the Internet in 
general speaks for itself in saying that they shouldn't be there.    
	The Internet was designed to rely on unreliability.  It can never 
officially be "shut down," in case of thunderstorms, or even, as its creators 
carefully planned, in case of nuclear attack.  Due to this, the more people 
that occupy the bandwidth of the Internet increases the unreliability and 
unstability.  This also means things will work slower, in attempts to 
accomodate the load of users.
	The attitudes of the people are different.  Compare the long-time 
Internet users, the high school and college students, playing loud music 
and dressing according to their own styles, with the middle-class middle-aged 
nine-to-fivers, family-oriented people who are climbing on the net, who have 
to check their computer's manuals to find out how to turn it on.  A conflict 
of ideas and beliefs separates the Internet into a fun-loving crowd and a "I 
want what I paid for:  information, not a bunch of kids swearing and 
bothering me."  The Internet is a means to keep people on the breaking edge 
of technology and information, not a place to learn family values and preach 
about goodness and religion.  If there is to be an Information Superhighway 
meant for everyone, it definately is not the Internet.  I'd like to find the 
guy who first provided the Internet as a commercial service and give him a 
piece of my mind.
	Despite attempts to stop the rush of unexperienced crowds of users who 
feel they can get on the Internet and act like they own it, it is still going 
on everyday, and at alarming rates.  As many as 2 million people will 
experience the Internet for the first time each month.  At a growth rate like 
this, something will have to be done to enforce a kind of population control.      
It is already a fact, though, that regular services are slower and sometimes 
not available due to an overflow of users.  Take the Internet Relay Chat 
service (IRC) for example.  Getting onto an IRC server is much harder now, 
with all the users swarming in for a taste of the infamous live, worldwide, 
uncensored teleconference system.  The IRC servers have user limits which 
only allows so many users on at a time.  By adding more users via commercial 
providers, and allowing these users to use other servers, they take away from 
us the freedom we once had.  In the future, the Internet might be up for 
sale, but who will buy it?  What will they do with it?  And who gets paid for 
selling it?  The simple answer to the demise of the Internet:  Money ruins 
everything.
	If you sympathize with the newbies and offer your helping hand to them,  
then maybe you're not really an Internet junkie after all.  If you oppose 
this invasion of the worldwide realtime network where many cyberpunks call 
home, then do something about it.  Not everyone can drive the fast, shiny 
cars...  Not everyone can build their dream home...  And not everyone can 
enjoy the Internet.  Whether we like it or not, our world is segregated.  
Very much so.  Segregation is not a bad thing in the way of protecting the 
Internet, so let's make it a goal to keep it out of the hands of those who 
don't deserve it.

	I have to say the whole H/P/A/V scene seems funny to me.  There are so 
many differences in views!  Which is the chaos that anarchists love of 
course, but otherwise its sorta fubar.  I mean we've got pure hackers out 
there who slam through VAX and UNIX systems, take a look around, and then 
leave without hurting a thing; doing it all just to learn something new 
(which is fine).  Then they go flame the destructive hackers.  Which again is 
fine!  That's their opinion.  YET they find it alright to card shit.  What 
the fuck is that shit!?!  Its still fucking with shit either way!  Now I 
could give a bunch more examples between the different actions, but you get 
the point.  Now I'm not saying everyone in the scene is like this, but there 
are those few...  If you're gonna take a stand:  TAKE A STAND DAMMIT!
	I think the coolest people are the mutha-fuckers who don't give a shit 
either way.  These guys (or girls) just do it and don't give a flying fuck 
what anybody thinks about it.  I mean lets face it folks, blowing shit up is 
against the law, so is hacking into a restricted system, carding a new 
motherboard is illegal too, so is using unauthorized codes to get a free 
phone call, etc...  Now we all know that those crimes may carry different 
penalties, but "Big Brother" doesn't like any of it.  Lets take this to "Big 
Brother" not each other.  In fact lets show them who's "Big Brother" when it 
comes to this shit.

Well that's my rant.  It turned out smaller then I thought it would.  Oh well...
