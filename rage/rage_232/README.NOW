  RAGE.EXE accepts two optional parameters, in any order.

  They are:

    /noansi - Do not load the ANSI driver (for if you already are running one)

    /novga  - Do not use VGA fades on the ansi screens (boring without it!)

  After running for the first time, RaGE will create the following buffer 
  files:
    
    intro
    chp_1
    chp_2
    chp_3
    chp_4
    end

  They can be deleted.
