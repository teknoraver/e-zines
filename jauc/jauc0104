 "The underground press serves as the only effective counter to a growing
 power, and more sophisticated techniques used by establishment mass media
 to falsify, misrepresent, misquote, rule out of consideration as a priori
 ridiculous, or simply ignore and blot out of existence: data, books,
 discoveries that they consider prejudicial to establishment interest..."

            We've Tried to Be Nice: Other Ways to Fight Clipper

 by Carl Guderian (bjacques@cypher.com)

 (You've read about Clipper ad nauseam elsewhere, so refer to other sources 
 if you still don't know about Clipper, the Digital Telephony Act, and 
 everything else that will be lumped together here under the rubric of 
 "Clipper."  Start with John Perry Barlow's excellent "Jackboots on the 
 Infobahn" in issue 2.04 of Wired Magazine. If you want balance, ask the NSA 
 for its opinion and weigh it against our position that Clipper obviously 
 blows. Onward.)

 The Situation, Spring 1994

 The Clinton White House is apparently steaming ahead on Clipper despite our 
 perfectly reasonable arguments and well-mannered campaign against it. To 
 John Perry Barlow (see intro) it plays like Invasion of the Body Snatchers 
 II: The White House Years--formerly sensible folks replaced by pod people 
 blandly assuring us that if "I could tell you what I know, you'd agree with 
 me."  No help there.
 
 Various industry consortia were ready to sell us down the slippery slope 
 until the feds double-crossed them at the last minute by rescinding the 
 offer to lift export controls on encryption in exchange for support for 
 Clipper. An attempt to make RSA/PGP encryption a politico-economic fait 
 accompli by sheer numbers of users is moving slowly, if at all (PGP really 
 requires direct internet access, it's hard to use, and RSA's suing Phil 
 Zimmerman so nobody else is going to dress it up for the market). The White 
 House spooks may make a bigger splash in the market by ordering their 
 50,000 electronic keyholes than we can by passing out copies of PGP for 
 free. We're fighting the enemy on its own turf and terms and we could lose. 
 It's time to fight dirty. Below are a couple of suggestions.

 Mutt and Jeff

 Just as for every civil rights Freedom Rider there was a Black Panther, for 
 every Pat Schroeder there's a Riot Grrl, and for every polished Dixiecrat 
 Senator there was a KKK Nightrider, so must we field media streetfighters 
 to complement our sincere and polite public spokesmen. The history of social 
 progress (and, unfortunately, reaction) is that of good cop and bad cop. 
 Opponents of Clipper must employ these Siamese twins of persuasion in order 
 to get anywhere. If you've never been interrogated by police, customs 
 officials, school principals, or corporate investigators, a little 
 explanation of good cop/bad cop may help. 

 In interrogations conducted in civilized countries, the object is to crack 
 the interviewee without resorting to physical torture. The most effective 
 method is good cop/bad cop. The bad cop, sent in first, acts enraged and 
 threatens to beat the truth out of the suspect. He gleefully enumerates all 
 the terrible things that can happen to an uncooperative suspect. Sometimes 
 this alone works. If the prisoner stands firm (or is frozen with fear), the 
 good cop comes to the rescue, radiating sympathy and bonhomie. He offers a 
 cigarette, a friendly ear, and assurances that, he and the suspect are 
 really on the same side. 
 
 The good cop plays on the suspect's pride, suspicions, or other 
 psychological weaknesses in order to get a voluntary confession. The good 
 cop's presence carries the implied threat of the return of the bad cop if 
 no confession is forthcoming. To accuse the good cop of waging psychological 
 warfare is to miss the point. Psychological warfare is waged by adept 
 deployment of both good and bad cops in order to break the prisoner. 
 It's very effective against folks who don't know any better, especially 
 young hackers, schoolkids, and Seattle scenesters en route to Vancouver. 

 The Occult Technology of Power

 The point of the above digression is that a tool well-known to the 
 authoritaries can be, and has been, used against them as well. As gays have 
 learned, neither the noisy AIDS Die-ins by ACT-UP nor lobbying by advocacy 
 groups is alone sufficient to win public support. Together the tactics work 
 because they offer different levels on which the public can deal with issues 
 (and people) that clearly won't go away. 

 Clipper advocates already know the weakness of their position, so arguments 
 are useless. They repeat the same arguments in hopes the public will get 
 tired of hearing about it and simply sign the blank check. We must pre-empt 
 the argument with bite-sized zingers. In the economy of attention, the 
 market goes to the side with the pithiest arguments. When they say "law and 
 order" we respond with "ATF." Such sound bites are Patriot Missiles that 
 shoot down the other side's forensic Scuds. Channel the spirits of Dorothy 
 Parker and Oscar Wilde. Give their straw man a hotfoot; they summon up 
 nuclear terrorism, we resurrect the Branch Davidians. The issue doesn't lend 
 itself to riotous demonstrations, but with a really good negative media 
 campaign we can whip up a good hate frenzy against Clipper. We already do 
 this somewhat, but we need to go further, with high concept slogans and 
 catch phrases. 
 
 "Clinton chip," like "Hooverville," has a dry, sharp ring to it, commanding 
 attention like the snap of a bone. Plus, it yokes the President personally 
 to the issue. If that sounds lame, try something else. The ancient 
 techniques of propaganda apply here, wedded to the black art of meme/
 information virus theory. It's a media war, so we'll use a little McLuhan. 
 (If you've read his stuff, you know his writing style was really disjointed, 
 but sounded great! Which may be the point.) Slick attack ads, sound bites, 
 rants to the editor, whisper campaigns, and other forms of media 
 manipulation are in order. Anything short of gross distortion or outright 
 lies is acceptable. The truth is scary enough and can be made to sound 
 positively Lovecraftian, if we succeed in seizing the metaphors. Detourned 
 ads such as "big brother inside" are a good start. The opportunities for 
 satire are boundless, especially given the history of government projects. 
 Emphasize how much more a Clippered future will play like "Brazil" than 
 "1984." 
 
 Why assume things will always work out for the Bad Guys Conspiracy? Want to 
 bet that when the government buys Clipper chips the Secret Service, FBI, 
 CIA, NSA, and State Department will probably spy on each other (since no one 
 else will use it)? Or that when Clipper charges out the fortress gate its 
 broken carcass will likely be flung back over the wall (i.e., it will be 
 cracked and posted to the net)? How will they know I haven't sold my 
 Clippered cellular phone at a garage sale? And so on. 
 
 Negative campaigns don't by themselves win support, but reasonable words 
 don't win much attention either. Both tricks must be played in their turn. 
 Not good cop or bad cop, but good cop AND bad cop. A diverse battle plan 
 gives sympathizers more options for action. Some folks like to lobby and 
 others like to sling mud. Hey, we're a big tent. And the streetfighters can 
 keep the lobbyists honest. 

 Useful Idiots

 In order for an issue to get attention it should demonstrably arouse the ire 
 of a number of large and unrelated groups. Right wing fundamentalist 
 screwheads as well as flaming liberals stand to lose if Clipper becomes the 
 law, so we put a bug in their respective ears in hopes of getting a 
 response. Support for one's position comes from surprising places. 
 Cyberpagans, for example, will be shocked to learn that Phyllis 
 "Church Lady" Schlafly denounced Clipper in a syndicated column a couple of 
 months back (she got a few details wrong, but you have to expect that). 
 Equally shocking (at least to this writer) is Rush Limbaugh, avid computer 
 user, so far passing up an opportunity to savage Clinton on Clipper. Liberal 
 groups can be persuaded that a conservative Republican administration armed 
 with Clipper would make J. Edgar Hoover look like Norbert the Narc.
  
 This strategy is aimed primarily at right wing groups for a number of 
 reasons. They already hate the present Democratic administration.  They're
 best at marshalling money and "good-ole-boy" clout. Right-wing paranoia is 
 more entertaining than the left-wing variety, so it is more likely to be 
 heard. To the Christian Right, for instance, Clipper carries the musky scent 
 of the Beast 666, and they expect Clinton to spend a second term stamping 
 our hands at the door of the Hellfire Club. And did you ever notice how 
 many cypherpunks own guns? Play up the gun analogy.
   
 This avenue to political action is time-critical. If 1997 sees a Republican 
 administration in place, right-wing groups will lose interest in attacking 
 it. And since it was the Bush White House (or spooks within it) that 
 proposed Clipper, you can bet the rent that President Dole, Quayle (!), or 
 whoever will make it a fact of life quicker than you can say "national 
 security." So much for looking to the Republicans for relief from Clipper.
 
  The Golden Apple of Discord

 Thank the Deist god of the Founding Fathers that our government is not a 
 monolithic entity possessed of a single will. Battles are already underway 
 over which agency gets the secret skeleton key to the Clipper escrow vault 
 to bypass the official safeguards that won't work anyway. Getting the Crips
 and Bloods to make peace was a cakewalk compared to Clinton's efforts to get
 the Three Letter Agencies to talk to each other. As long as they must 
 compete for funding it will be so. 

 Not quite the end

 With a bit of work we can play up Clipper so that it attracts as much 
 attention as the abortion, gun control, or gay rights issues have. Getting 
 the cover of Newsweek was good; mainstream coverage in a proposal normally 
 of interest only to propeller heads and conspiracy buffs is gratifying. 
 Remember the fallout after the Hacker Crackdown of 1990? But sustained 
 pressure is needed. Clinton's people need their noses rubbed in the sheer 
 breadth of opposition to Clipper. If a White House aide hears "Clinton Chip" 
 or something similar on the street, the President will hear of it and 
 realize we're serious.

 Really the end

 According to a recent issue of Federal Computer Week, the NSA is adopting as 
 it's mascot the armadillo. Maybe we can thank Bobby Ray Inman for this one. 
 FCW recently ran a contest to name the "dillo." Entrants were asked to 
 consider the NSA's reputation for prurience and the animal's best known 
 habitat (the freeway center stripe). The contest is probably over by now, 
 but "Roadkill" seemed to be the winner paws down. "Road rash," "Winston 
 [Smith]," and "Harry Buttle" (the poor sap whose erroneous arrest and 
 subsequent death under torture--er, information retrieval--trigger the 
 events of "Brazil") were this author's favorites.

 Credits

 Many thanks go posthumously to Marshall McLuhan for his theory of 
 perception, which states that most people see either the figure or the 
 background (a vase or two faces?) but that true perception is seeing both 
 figure and background.	This seemed pretty wacky a year ago, but it makes a 
 lot more sense now. Backhanded thanks go to a trio of Canadian customs 
 guards at the Peace Bridge connecting Buffalo, NY to Ft. Erie, Ontario for 
 personal instruction in the tactics of "good cop/bad cop". Thanks also to 
 ReSearch (for PRANKS!), the Situationist International (including King Mob), 
 Richard Dawkins (meme theory) and the late Count Alfred Korzybski (general 
 semantics), for inspiration.

 Please wash your hands before leaving the 20th century.

 ============================================================================

 What's this?  This is an updated announcement and invitation to DEF CON II,
 a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
 to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
 Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
 Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc..

 WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
 WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
        that you would normally never hear.
 WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994 (Speaking on the 23rd and 24th)
 WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel

 So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part II?  You heard about the
 parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
 check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we're heading to Vegas! 

 Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:

 "DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
 computer event I have attended in years." -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World 

 "Toto, I don't think we're at COMDEX anymore." -- CodeRipper, Gray Areas

 "Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
 bits of torn paper, a few McDonald's Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
 The documents disappeared in seconds." -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine

 DESCRIPTION:

 Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
 planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
 speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
 We attempt to bring the underground into contact with "legitimate" speakers.
 Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
 try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
 other conferences.

 While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the
 evil hackers to party and wreak havok, it's just not the case.  People come
 to DEF CON for information and for making contacts. We strive to distinguish
 this convention from others in that respect.

 WHAT'S NEW THIS YEAR:

 This year will be much larger and more organized (hopefully) than last year.
 We have a much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.
 Because of this we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect
 speaking to run Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new
 things expected include:

 o An Internet connection with sixteen ports will be there, _BUT_ will only
   provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
   bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
   network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection.

 o There will be door prizes, and someone has already donated a Cell Phone
   and a few "Forbidden Subjects" cd ROMs to give away, thanks to Dead 
   Addict.

 o Dr. Ludwig will present his virus creation awards on Sunday. 

 o A bigger and better "Spot The Fed" contest, which means more shirts to
   give away.

 o More room, we should have tables set up for information distribution.
   If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
   designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
   convention space.

 o A 24 hour movie / video suite where we will be playing all type of
   stuff.
   VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titles to show, or bring your own.
   We'll use a wall projector when not in use by speakers.

 o Midnight Tech Talks on Friday and Saturday night to cover the more
   technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions.

 WHO IS SPEAKING:==========================================================

 This list represents almost all of the speakers verified to date.  Some
 people do not want to be announced until the event for various reasons, or
 are waiting for approval from employers.  A speaking schedule will go out
 in the next announcement.


 Phillip Zimmerman, Notorious Cryptographer & author of PGP.
 Dr. Ludwig, Author of "The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses," and
     "Computer Viruses, Artificial Life and Evolution"
 Loyd Blankenship (The Mentor), Net Running in the 90's and RPG.
 Padgett Peterson, Computer Enthusiest, Anti-Virus Programmer.
 The Jackal, A Radio Communications Overview, Digital Radio and the Hack 
 Angle.
 Judi Clark, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.
 Gail Thackery, (Of Operation Sun Devil Fame), Topic to be Announced.
 To be Announced, The Software Publishers Association, Topic to be Announced.
 Toni Aimes, Ex U.S. West Cellular Fraud, Cellular Fraud Topics.
 Mark Lotter, Cellular Enthusiest, Hacking Cell Phones.
 Lorax, The Lighter Side of VMBs.
 Peter Shipley, Unix Stud, Q&A on Unix Security.
 George Smith, Crypt Newsletter, Virus Topic to be Announced.
 Cathy Compton, Attorney, Q&A Surrounding Seisure Issues, Etc.
 John Littman, Reporter and Author, Kevin Poulson, Mitnick, and Agent Steal.
 Red Five & Hellbender, Madmen With a Camcorder, Who Knows?
 Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe), Wierd Wireless Psycho Shit.. Stay Tuned..

 There should be a few round table discussions on Virus, Cellular, Unix and
 something else surrounding the industry.

 I'll name the rest of the the speakers as they confirm.  I'm still working 
 on a few (Two?) people and groups, so hopefully things will work out and I 
 can pass the good news on in the next announcement, or over our List Server.

 ============================================================================

 WHERE THIS THING IS:

 It's in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
 anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
 about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
 you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
 Hotel.  Intel is as follows:

         The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078 
         Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Tripple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax

         Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap.

    NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON II
    convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
    based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
    it makes you feel better, 'cuz the more that register the better for
    my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
    get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Try to contact
    people on the Interactive Mailing List (More on that below) and
    hook up with people.  Don't let the hotel people get their hands on
    your baggage, or there is a mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas
    has killer unions. 

 OTHER STUFF:

 I'll whip up a list of stuff that's cool to check out in town there so if 
 for some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
 sites in the city of true capitalism.  If anyone lives in Las Vegas, I
 would appreciate it if you could send a list of some cool places to check 
 out or where to go to see the best shows and I'll post it in the next
 announcement or in the program

 -o I am asking for people to submit to me any artwork, pictures, drawings,
    logos, etc. that they want me to try and include in this years program.
    I am tring to not violate any copywrite laws, but wat cool shit.  Send
    me your art or whatever and I'll try and use it in the program, giving 
    you credit for the work, of course.  Please send it in .TIF format if it 
    has more than eight bit color. The program will be eight bit black and 
    white.
 -o in case you want to make adjustments on your side.

 *** NEW MAILING LIST SERVER ***

 We've finally gotten Major Dommo List Serv software working (Kinda) and it
 is now ready for testing.  MTV spent alot of time hacking this thing to work
 with BSDi, and I would like to thank him.  The purpose of the list is to
 allow people interested in DEF CON II to chat with one another.  It would
 be very sueful for people over 21 who want to rent hotel space, but split
 costs with others.  Just mention you have room for 'x' number of people, and
 I'm sure you'll get a response from somone wanting to split costs.  Someone
 also suggested that people could organize a massive car caravan from 
 Southern Ca. to the Con.  My attitude is that the list is what you make of 
 it.  Here are the specifics:

 Umm.. I TAKE THAT BACK!!  The mailing list is _NOT_ ready yet.  Due to
 technical problems, etc.  I'll do another mass mailing to everyone letting
 them know that the list is up and how to access it.  Sorry for the delay! 

 MEDIA:

 Some of the places you can look for information from last year include: 

 New Media Magazine, September 1993
 InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
 Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2, #3 (Fall 1993)
 Unix World, ???,
 Phrack #44

 COST: 

 Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
 $15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
 color name tag (We're gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
 door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
 the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
 cheapness.

 ==========================================================================

 I wanted to thank whoever sent in the anonymous fax to Wired that
 was printed in issue 1.5  Cool deal!

 Subject: OBITUARY - VAX 8600, aka Mimsy, dead at age 8
     
        An era of computing in the University of Maryland Computer Science
 Department came to an end Sunday, March 20th, when the Department's last 
 VAX, an 8600, peacefully died in its sleep. After a power-down, the VAX, 
 which had been off maintenance since July, 1993, was not able to boot as 
 a result of a disk/controller that finally went bad.

      The 8600 had arrived in 1986 as the Department's most powerful machine
 and had been named "Brillig"; in November 1990, when the Department's VAX 
 11/785 was retired, the 8600 assumed the name and duties of "Mimsy" and 
 had served in that capacity until its semi-retirement in July, 1994. At 
 that time, the 8600 was renamed "Imladris" and the "Mimsy" moniker was 
 bestowed upon a Sun SPARC 10/30.

      Along with being the last VAX, the 8600 was also the last UMD machine
 running the mutoid 4.3/4.3tahoe/4.3reno/Net-2 conglomeration (4.3BSD Torix, 
 as it was called here) that emerged over the span of a decade of working 
 with Unix. Although it is now gone, the hacks it helped inspire live on
 in locally-changed versions of the SunOS, Ultrix, OSF/1 and BSDI offerings 
 in hundreds of other systems here.

      It is somewhat ironic that the VAX ended the way it did. Its demise
 was originally scheduled for earlier that week, when the 8600, after a short 
 ceremony, was to have committed suicide. The machine would have, under its 
 own free will and volition, executed (through the "cron" facility) a shell 
 script prepared by Dr. Vax Kevorkian which would have issued an "rm -rf /" 
 command. Onlookers were to have watched the process until the machine seized 
 up, and would have then powered the machine down and gone to dinner.

      However, an earlier problem with the building Uninterruptible Power
 Supply (UPS) necessitated a load test for the 20th, and as a large consumer 
 of power, it was decided the 8600 would remain on for this one last task. As 
 a result of a short power-down during the UPS load test, the machine's 
 mighty heart (ummm, disk) gave out.
 
      Funeral arrangements are not yet complete, but tentative plans call
 for shipping the remains to Chris Torek's apartment in Berkeley, as a token 
 of the staff's appreciation. The staff has requested that all gifts of 
 condolence be made to the University of Maryland's Dinner-for-Wayword-
 Hackers Fund; checks may be made payable to Pete Cottrell.
      
        MIMSY IS DEAD! LONG LIVE MIMSY!

     CALL FOR PAPERS: Neural Networks for Automatic Target Recognition 

 By Dept of Cognitive and Neural Systems (announce@retina.bu.edu)

 ATR is a many-faceted problem of tremendous importance in industrial and
 defense applications. Biological systems excel at these tasks, and neural
 networks may provide a robust, real-time, and compact means for achieving
 solutions to ATR problems. ATR systems utilize a host of sensing modalities
 (visible, multispectral, IR, SAR, and ISAR imagery; radar, sonar, and acoustic
 time series; and fusion of multiple sensing modalities) in order to detect 
 and track targets in clutter, and classify them. This Special Issue will 
 bring together a broad range of invited and contributed articles that 
 explore a variety of software and hardware modules and systems, and 
 biological inspirations, focused on solving ATR problems. We particularly 
 welcome articles involving applications to real data, though the journal 
 cannot publish classified material. It will be the responsibility of the 
 submitting authors to insure that all submissions are of an unclassified 
 nature.

                  PRESS RELEASE: SPYGLASS/NCSA AGREEMENT
                  
 From: Eric W. Sink (eric@spyglass.com)

 The following press release announces our new relationship with NCSA
 and Mosaic.  I would like to prepend a clarification or two:
 Initially, Spyglass will sell Mosaic to volume users requiring a
 minimum of 5000 licenses per year.  It is our intention to let the
 needs of smaller volume customers, including end-users, be met thru
 other channels.

 Also, remember that NCSA Mosaic, for Windows, Mac, and UNIX will
 continue to be freely available from NCSA.  Development of the free
 versions will continue at NCSA, and Spyglass will be in collaboration
 with the NCSA development team.
 
 At Internet World Booth #609:
 For Immediate Release 

 Spyglass Signs Agreement with NCSA to Enhance and Broadly Relicense
 Mosaic Graphical Browser for the Internet
 (C)1994 Internet World
 Commercial Windows and Macintosh Versions Available in June; X Windows
 Version to Follow in July

 INTERNET WORLD, SAN JOSE, Calif., June 1 -- Spyglass, Inc. and the
 National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the
 University of Illinois/Urbana-Champaign have entered into an agreement
 that will get Mosaic, NCSA's graphical browser for the Internet, to
 the desktops of millions of people. The agreement gives Spyglass full
 rights to enhance, commercialize and broadly relicense
 Mosaic. Spyglass is making a multimillion-dollar commitment to NCSA
 and will focus initially on developing a commercially enhanced version
 of Mosaic that other companies will incorporate with their products
 for distribution to their customers. The announcement was made today
 in San Jose, on the opening day of exhibits at the Spring '94 Internet
 World conference.

 Developed by NCSA, Mosaic gives users point-and-click access to the
 World Wide Web (WWW), an information retrieval system on the Internet
 with more than 2,300 graphical, multimedia databases of "hyperlinked"
 documents. The Internet is a vast "supernetwork" of public and private
 networks connecting thousands of organizations and an estimated 20
 million individual users. New users are joining the Internet at the
 rate of 2 million each month, and hundreds of new WWW servers are
 coming online every month. Because of the reach of the Internet, it
 offers an attractive vehicle for electronic publishing and for
 conducting business globally.

 "Mosaic and World Wide Web are two key ingredients for successful
 electronic publishing and commerce on the Internet. But, to date,
 businesses have tapped only a fraction of the Internet's potential
 because these tools haven't been commercially available. Working with
 NCSA, we're going to change this," said Douglas Colbeth, president of
 Spyglass, which was formed in 1990 and has commercialized other NCSA
 technologies.

 "We're committed to evolving Mosaic so it becomes a robust, commercial
 tool with complete documentation, technical support and advanced
 features," explained Tim Krauskopf, co-founder of Spyglass and
 developer of NCSA Telnet. "We'll be collaborating with NCSA and other
 key partners to create new tools and establish standards that will
 help organizations build robust World Wide Web information servers
 quickly and inexpensively."

 "It has been thrilling to see the universal acceptance of NCSA Mosaic
 as an interactive window into cyberspace," said Larry Smarr, director
 of the NCSA. "I am very pleased to see Spyglass making such a
 financial commitment to the commercialization of Mosaic, which frees
 NCSA up to develop the next level of functionality for the public
 domain. Spyglass has been a terrific technology partner for us in the
 past and we look forward to an even closer working relationship in the
 future."

 "We welcome Spyglass as our partner in this effort because of the
 company's track record in commercializing other NCSA technologies and
 our rapidly developing close working relationship with the people at
 Spyglass," said Joseph Hardin, associate director of NCSA's software
 program. "Spyglass gives us the cross-platform development, global
 distribution and ongoing financial resources we need to take the
 Mosaic environment to the next level. With this commercialization
 arrangement with Spyglass in place, NCSA is freed to continue to
 develop core technologies for Mosaic as well as new technologies that
 leverage the Internet. We encourage companies to take advantage of
 this new relationship with Spyglass and contact them about volume
 licensing arrangements for Mosaic technology."

 Mosaic has been called the "killer application" for the Internet
 because it lets users navigate the Internet by browsing through a
 series of graphical, multimedia documents. The WWW was developed
 several years ago by CERN, a European consortium of scientists based
 in Switzerland, to keep track of researchers' information and to
 provide an easy method of sharing data. Subsequently, WWW has grown
 into one of the world's most open and widely used environments for
 information publishing, browsing and retrieval.

 WWW servers contain eye-catching documents with built-in links to
 other documents, allowing the user to move easily and naturally around
 the Internet. With Mosaic, users can browse through page after page of
 menus, hyperlinked to data dispersed all over the world, without
 having to know the location or network address of the information they
 are seeking.

 Spyglass has re-architected Mosaic so it will be a more robust and
 full-featured tool.  Enhancements available in Enhanced NCSA Mosaic
 from Spyglass include improved installation, better memory management,
 increased performance, new forms capabilities, online hypertext-based
 help, support for a proxy gateway and user interface improvements such
 as support for multiple windows. Future versions will include enhanced
 security and authentication, which will enable credit-card and other
 business transactions to take place on the Internet; filters that will
 enable documents from popular document readers to be read seamlessly
 by Mosaic; and integration with emerging editing and document
 management tools. A number of businesses are already using Mosaic and
 WWW to publish magazines, deliver goods and services, provide
 technical support to customers and conduct other forms of business
 electronically. For example, Mosaic and WWW are part of the recently
 announced $12 million CommerceNet project, a public- and
 private-sector-backed initiative exploring various ways to conduct
 commerce over the Internet and other data networks. NCSA will continue
 to maintain a public-with-copyright version of Mosaic, which Internet
 users can download for free from the Internet. NCSA, which began
 distributing Mosaic in the late fall, estimates that more than one
 million people use Mosaic and that more than 30,000 copies are being
 downloaded each month.

 Spyglass will be targeting the following types of customers as initial
 prospects for large-scale Mosaic client licensing agreements: computer
 systems and communications vendors, publishers and content providers,
 and online information service providers. For example, a publisher
 might want to include Mosaic with a subscription to an online magazine
 or a computer vendor might want to include Mosaic with each system
 sold. By building WWW servers themselves and distributing Mosaic
 clients to their customers, businesses can easily use this system for
 communicating with customers, providing technical support,
 distributing product and marketing information and other kinds of
 commerce.
  
 Enhanced NCSA Mosaic from Spyglass will be available for Microsoft
 Windows and Apple Macintosh desktop computers this month and for X
 Windows computers in July. To navigate the Internet, Mosaic users
 require a direct connection to the Internet or a PPP or SLIP
 connection. Enhanced NCSA Mosaic from Spyglass will be priced
 aggressively for high-volume distribution, enabling licensees to
 incorporate Mosaic into their products and services for a modest
 cost. For more information about Enhanced NCSA Mosaic from Spyglass,

                            THE REAL STORY

 By Carl Guderian (bjacques@cypher.com)

 The Real Story

 (The following report is a compilation of printed materials and transcripts 
 of personal interviews conducted by the author(s). In the course of this 
 exhaustive research we have come to feel that, given the controversial 
 nature of the subject matter, it is best that the authors as well as their 
 primary sources be kept confidential. Perhaps it is just as well, as the 
 events depicted in the report are years or decades in the past. Many of the 
 principals are retired or dead and, therefore, beyond any earthly reward or 
 revenge. The author(s) may be dead, too. In this line of journalism, that is 
 very likely.

 1994, Leopold & Loeb, Media Consultants)

 
 Employee Motivation Seminars

 Employee motivational seminars are a modern management tool, predicated on 
 the assumption that external motivation, whether carrot or stick or 
 combination thereof, is insufficient to move employees to give 110% to the 
 job; rather, internal motivation must be cultivated in the employees 
 somehow. Motivational seminars, usually conducted by outside consulting 
 firms, employ a variety of techniques, from survey questionnaires to group 
 exercises to meditation. These seminars have become enormously popular since 
 their introduction in the 1950s (mostly in sales-related fields then), as 
 they present a real advance over basic reward/punishment systems (-Theories 
 X and Y+) or even Frederick W. Taylor's scientific methods. More 
 importantly, they have actually worked. Workplace productivity has markedly 
 increased since the introduction of motivational seminars. 
 
 However, no innovation is universally welcomed. Recently, deeply religious 
 employees have begun to level serious accusations against motivational 
 seminars, declaring the programs promote a socialistic or New Age ethic. A 
 socialistic attitude, they argue, will lead otherwise sensible people to 
 embrace a world government under the Anti-Christ, as predicted in the Book 
 of Revelation in the Christian Bible (as interpreted by fundamentalist 
 Christians). A related and more serious charge is that the meditation 
 techniques (such as those used in the Krone program) open employees to 
 possession by demons. The latter charge is the focus of this report.
 
 The diabolical connection is real. Employee motivational seminars did indeed 
 spring from an arrangement between American industry and the Prince of 
 Darkness. Satan respects Americans like he respects no other people because 
 it was an American, Daniel Webster, who defeated him in court, using his 
 wits. Others have beaten the Devil, but only through invoking the powers of 
 Heaven, a tactic akin to bringing in grownups to restrain a schoolyard 
 bully. American corporate executives cut a deal with the Devil to deliver 
 the souls of underlings in exchange for the usual favors. Though the souls 
 of corporate employees are industrial grade, and therefore not worth as much 
 as the souls of the elite, an executive must deliver a number of them in 
 exchange for infernal favors. Paradoxically, the worth of elite American 
 souls has risen in direct proportion to the degradation in the worth of 
 those of followers. The perfect mechanism for delivering B-grade souls by 
 the bushel is, of course, an employee motivational seminar, in which large 
 numbers of workers are possessed at once (By the way, television evangelists 
 work the same way; their mass public healings are actually mass 
 possessions).
 
 This cozy arrangement between American leaders and Satan has served both 
 sides well. Demons consider possession of Americans to be a kind of working 
 vacation, a welcome relief from tormenting the damned souls toiling 
 eternally in the flaming dung-pits of Hell. Not that this isn't enjoyable 
 work, but even a demon likes a change of scenery. Satan and his lieutenants 
 can dole out plum earthside assignments for demonic devotion, thus 
 reinforcing the infernal hierarchy. American leaders, of course, get the 
 usual rewards of power, sexual potency (or firm breasts and derriere), and 
 that Christmas bonus for boosting corporate productivity while laying off 
 excess workers.

 Lately, however, the system's inherent problems have begun to manifest 
 themselves. As motivational seminars have gained in popularity, they have 
 increased the demand for demons. As the innovation has become more 
 widespread, it has ceased to be a competitive advantage. In Hell, too, the 
 system's success has presented similar problems, and Satan is now seems 
 ready to pull out of the deal.
 
 The shortage of demons is a Hellish fact. Present-day demons, of course, are 
 the same ones who participated in the original rebellion of Lucifer (now 
 Satan). All the angels were created at once, and no new ones have been made 
 since. The pool of demons, then, is a subset of that group. Occasionally a 
 truly wicked soul is promoted to demon status, but equally often a demon is 
 devoured by an angry superior (a la C. S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters). On 
 the whole, the supply of demons should be considered to be fixed. 
 
 In the early years of the program, American executives were pleased to see 
 their employees possessed by only the most hard-working demons. Today, 
 however, all the good ones are taken. Latter-day possessions by demons of 
 procurement fraud, office-supply theft, and general loafing on the job have 
 taken their toll on the system. Worse, even the best and brightest demons 
 seem to have gone native or become Americanized, becoming easily distracted 
 by the attractions of our post-industrial society or falling dangerously 
 into sympathy with the modern worker.  One formerly trustworthy (!) demon 
 was even caught committing workplace sabotage in solidarity with his 
 co-workers!  An embarrassed Satan had to deal personally with the matter.  
 All in all, the phrase working like a demon has begun to lose its cachet.
 
 As more corporations jumped on the infernal bandwagon, they found that the 
 employees of their competitors were performing equally well (or recently, 
 equally poorly). Worse, as the quality of the everyday American soul has 
 declined, many hapless executives have found themselves caught short. In one 
 company, the worth of the workers' souls had fallen drastically between the 
 signing of the contract and the possession of the workers. The contracting 
 executive killed a fellow executive (who was his wife - also on the infernal 
 take) over the shrinking soul pie at their company in order to hold up his 
 end of the bargain, lest he be forced to hand over his own soul. It didn't 
 help. The wife caught up with him in Hell.
 
 Meanwhile, in Hell the situation has also deteriorated. Eventually all 
 demons have been recruited earthside, so the dream ticket has ceased to be a 
 credible reward for exemplary effort. Furthermore, production in the Satanic 
 Mills is down. Temporarily out of sight of their demon overseers, damned 
 souls have begun shirking on the eternal job.
 
 By piecing together accounts channeled through trance mediums (leaks are now 
 worse than ever!), the authors have been able to determine that Satan has 
 begun revoking all contracts dealing with motivational seminars, releasing 
 the possessed workers and taking back favors bestowed on contractees. This 
 may partly explain the recent decline of the old industrial corporations in 
 favor of information technology firms, in which traditional religious values 
 are relatively absent.
 
 Thus, the era of employee motivation seminars seems to be drawing to a 
 close. The heyday of private economic deals with the Devil seems to be over 
 as well. Overheard executive conversatons reveal that Satan is simply not 
 interested in any more such contracts. Though some may be tempted to see the 
 above episode as another case of the power elite enlisting the powers of 
 Hell to fuck over the little guy, they should look at the larger picture and 
 realize the system seems to have taken care of itself according to the laws 
 of the Free Market. The Invisible Hand really does seem to work. 


 Postscript

 It now appears that Satan plans to compete in the world labor market after 
 having seen the prevailing trend toward cheaper labor. He has an advantage 
 over the Chinese, who lead the market using convict/slave labor. Political 
 prisoners have to be fed bread and water and must be allowed 3 or 4 hours of 
 sleep a day. The damned souls of Hell, of course, eat nothing and work 
 tirelessly twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The Devil now knows 
 quite a bit about management theory (in relation to his demonic supervisors) 
 and wants to recall them to Hell to oversee the re-engineering of Hell's 
 production lines. Modern world leaders thinking to hold off this development 
 are doomed to failure. Hell has on its side such notables as Albert Speer, 
 Josef Stalin, Adolf Eichmann, and Roy Cohn (to handle the legal work) and 
 will soon have Henry Kissinger to handle international relations. Given a 
 team like that, it's only a matter of time.

 Post-postscript

 The original (now void) contracts are sought-after collectors items, not the 
 least for their blackmail value. Even when the signatories are beyond 
 blackmail, as in the case of the aforementioned executive and his wife, 
 their contracts are worth a lot simply as works of art. The Devil is a 
 traditionalist at heart, and insists that contracts be handwritten by demons 
 noted for their calligraphic skill and that the documents bear his seal and 
 those of major demons acting as witnesses. The early contracts (pre-1983) 
 are worth the most, as they are the most visually stunning and bear the 
 names of America's best and brightest of the time, as well as the seals of 
 Hell's best known demons and devils.

     LIBERTARIAN PARTY ANNOUNCES OPPOSITION TO DIGITAL TELEPHONY ACT

 NEWS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY
 1528 Pennsylvania Avenue SE
 Washington DC 20003

 For additional information:
 Bill Winter, Director of Communications
        (202) 543-1988



        Calling it a "serious infringement of civil liberties and a
 gross violation of property rights," the Libertarian Party National
 Committee unanimously voted to oppose the Digital Telephony and
Communications Act of 1994. 

        At their quarterly meeting in Kansas City, Missouri, the
 governing body of America's third-largest political party charged that
 "the Digital Telephony Act would make furnishing the FBI with easy
 wiretapping capability the overriding priority for designers of
 telephone equipment and related software."

        "It is a lie to call this legislation a 'Privacy Improvement
 Act,'" said Bill Evers, the National Committee member from California
 who sponsored the resolution.

        The Digital Telephony Act, noted the resolution, "requires
 telephone, cable television, and computer network companies to ensure
 that the government can conduct surveillance while private communication 
 is going on. It requires the installation of surveillance-facilitating
 software in telephone switching equipment to expose personal information -- 
 such as telephone-calling patterns, credit card purchases, banking
 records, and medical records -- to the view of the government."

        "Such personal information should be the private property of
 either the company that assembles it or the individual to whom it
 pertains," said Evers.

        Libertarians also oppose the Digital Telephony Act because it
 "would require a fundamental re-engineering of the communications
 infrastructure at great expense to American taxpayers, and to the
 owners of private communications systems," said Evers.

        The Libertarian National Committee also unanimously voted to
 oppose the National Security Agency's Escrowed Encryption Standard -
 the so-called Clipper Chip system - or any "government policies
 promoting or requiring specific encryption methods for civilian use."
 The party also urged the "repeal of the U.S. ban on export abroad of
 Clipper-free encryption devices produced by American companies."

        "Government-mandated encryption standards will foster
 indiscriminate surveillance of private communications by the
 government," charged Evers. 

        The resolution said "the Clinton Administration plans to induce 
 American manufacturers to install government-readable encryption devices 
 in every telephone, fax machine, and computer modem made in the United 
 States."

        "The Clinton Administration is explicitly denying that the
 American people have the right to communicate in private," said Evers.
 By contrast, he said, "The Libertarian Party has long upheld the civil
 liberties of the American citizen."

        Approximately 120 Libertarians serve in elected and appointed
 office around the country, including four State Representatives in New
 Hampshire and two mayors in California. The Libertarian Party platform
 calls for vigorous defense of the Bill of Rights, free enterprise,
 civil liberties, free trade, and private charity.

                             UNABOM
                       $1,000,000 Reward
                 SERIES OF 14 UNSOLVED BOMBINGS


 William L. Tafoya, Ph.D. Special Agent, FBI
 UNABOM Task Force, San Francisco, CA (btafoya@orion.arc.nasa.gov)
 

   Beginning in May, 1978, a series of 14 bombing incidents have 
 occurred across the United States for which there is no apparent 
 explanation or motive.  No person or group has been identified as 
 the perpetrator(s) of these incidents.  The explosions have taken 
 place in seven states from Connecticut to California.  As a result 
 of these bombings, one person has been killed and 23 others 
 injured, some grievously.  There had been no incidents identified 
 with this series of bombings since 1987. However that changed in 
 late June, 1993, when a well known geneticist residing in Tiburon, 
 California, and a renown computer scientist from Yale University, 
 New Haven, Connecticut, opened packages which had been mailed to 
 them and both were severely injured when these packages exploded.  

   In the past, targets of the bomber have been associated with 
 the computer industry, the aircraft and airline industry and 
 universities.  Seven of these devices have been mailed to specific 
 individuals and the other seven have been placed in locations 
 which suggest there was no specific intended victim. All but two 
 of the explosive devices functioned as designed and exploded.  All 
 14 crimes, dubbed "UNABOM", have had common effects:  all have 
 caused terror, grief, and fear.  On September 11, 1985, Hugh 
 Scrutton, the owner of the Rentech Computer Company, in 
 Sacramento, California, was killed by one of these diabolic 
 devices.  The two most recent victims narrowly escaped death.  

   In response to the June, 1993, events, the Attorney General 
 directed that a task force of federal law enforcement agencies be 
 reestablished to urgently investigate and solve these crimes. The 
 UNABOM Task Force, consisting of investigators from the FBI, ATF, 
 and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, has been operational in 
 San Francisco and Sacramento, California, since July 12, 1993, and 
 is dedicated exclusively to the investigation of these crimes.  

   Among the clues in the case are the following words in what 
 appears to be a note possibly written by the bomber as a reminder 
 to make a telephone call:  "call Nathan R--Wed 7PM."  The UNABOM 
 Task Force believes that "Nathan R" may be associated, perhaps 
 innocently, with the bomber and that "Nathan R" may have received 
 a telephone call from the bomber on a Wednesday prior to the June, 
 1993 bombings.

   The two most recent tragic bombings illustrate the senseless 
 and tragic consequences of these crimes and demonstrate the urgent 
 necessity of solving this case.  This serial bomber will strike 
 again.  We do not know who the next victim will be.  We do believe 
 that there is someone out there who can provide the identity of 
 the person or persons responsible for these crimes. This person 
 may be a friend, a neighbor, or even a relative of the bomber(s).

	UNABOM's chronology is as follows:

 1)  Northwestern University
     Evanston, Illinois
     May 25, 1978           

   A package was found in the Engineering Department parking lot 
 at the Chicago Circle Campus of the University of Illinois. The 
 package was addressed to an Engineering Professor at Rensselaer 
 Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.  The package had a return 
 address of a Professor at Northwestern's Technological Institute.  
 The package was returned to the addressor who turned it over to 
 the Northwestern University Police Department because he had not 
 sent the package.  On May 26, 1978 the parcel was opened by a 
 police officer who suffered minor injuries when the bomb 
 detonated.

 2)  Northwestern University
     Evanston, Illinois
     May 9, 1979            

   A disguised explosive device which had been left in a common 
 area in the University's Technological Institute, slightly injured 
 a graduate student on May 9, 1979, when he attempted to open the 
 box and it exploded. 

 3)  Chicago, Illinois
     November 15, 1979

   An explosive device disguised as a parcel was mailed from 
 Chicago for delivery to an unknown location.  The bomb detonated 
 in the cargo compartment of an airplane, forcing it to make an 
 emergency landing at Dulles Airport.  Twelve individuals were 
 treated for smoke inhalation.  The explosion destroyed the 
 wrapping to such an extent that the addressee could not be 
 determined.

 4)  Chicago, Illinois
     June 10, 1980    

   A bomb disguised as a parcel postmarked June 8, 1980 was 
 mailed to an airline executive at his home in Lake Forest, 
 Illinois.  The airline executive was injured in the explosion.

 5)  University of Utah
     Salt Lake City, Utah
     October 8, 1981     

   An explosive device was found in the hall of a classroom 
 building and rendered safe by bomb squad personnel.  

 6)  Vanderbilt University
     Nashville, Tennessee
     May 5, 1982          

   A wooden box containing a pipe bomb detonated on May 5, 1982, 
 when opened by a secretary in the Computer Science Department.  
 The secretary suffered minor injuries.  The package was initially 
 mailed from Provo, Utah on April 23, 1982, to Pennsylvania State 
 University and then forwarded to Vanderbilt.  

 7)  University of California
     Berkeley, California
     July 2, 1982            

   A small metal pipe bomb was placed in a coffee break room of 
 Cory Hall at the University's Berkeley Campus.  A Professor of 
 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science was injured when he 
 picked up the device.  

 8)  Auburn, Washington
     May 8, 1985       

   A parcel bomb was mailed on May 8, 1985, to the Boeing 
 Company, Fabrication Division.  On June 13, 1985, the explosive 
 device was discovered when employees opened it.  The device was 
 rendered safe by bomb squad personnel without injury.

 9)  University of California
     Berkeley, California
     May 15, 1985            

   A bomb detonated in a computer room at Cory Hall on the 
 Berkeley Campus.  A graduate student in Electrical Engineering 
 lost partial vision in his left eye and four fingers from his 
 right hand.  The device was believed to have been placed in the 
 room several days prior to detonation.

 10)  Ann Arbor, Michigan
      November 15, 1985  

   A textbook size package was mailed to the home of a 
 University of Michigan Professor in Ann Arbor, Michigan from Salt 
 Lake City.  On November 15, 1985, a Research Assistant suffered 
 injuries when he opened the package.  The Professor was a few feet 
 away but was not injured.


 11)  Sacramento, California
      December 11, 1985     

   Mr. Hugh Scrutton was killed outside his computer rental

                   MASSACHUSETTS ENCRYPTION BILL


                    THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS
  
       MASSACHUSETTS 179TH GENERAL COURT -- 1994 REGULAR SESSION

 HOUSE NO.  4491
 BY MR. COHEN OF NEWTON, PETITION OF DAVID B.  COHEN AND ANOTHER RELATIVE
 TO ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL RECORDS LAW AND REGULATING THE
 TECHNOLOGY OF DATA  ENCRYPTION.  THE JUDICIARY.
                       

                                                  February 25, 1994

 AN ACT RELATIVE TO THE TECHNOLOGY OF DATA  ENCRYPTION. 
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General
 Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:

 SECTION 1.  The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after
 chapter sixty-six A the following chapter:

 CHAPTER 66B. MASSACHUSETTS PRIVACY OF PERSONAL RECORDS ACT.

 Section 1. For the purposes of this chapter the following terms shall
 have the following meanings:

 "Personal data files", any machine readable information or information
 in a state of electronic, optic, or other computer based transmission
 which is capable of being read, stored, copied, transmitted, changed,
 or deleted by or through computer or telecommunications devices and
 which relates to or describes any person, including a corporation,
 partnership or sole proprietorship, or such person's real or personal
 property. It shall include, but not be limited to, magnetic tapes,
 disks, cartridges, floppy disks, CD-ROM's, optical cubes or other
 optical storage devices, documents printed in magnetic ink or OCR
 symbol sets, and any other medium capable of being read or stored at
 high speed, in large volume, or without substantial human
 intervention.  The term denotes the substance of the information as
 distinguished from the incidental medium of its storage or
 transmission.

 " Encrypted" , changed in form by programmed routines or algorithms so
 as to be unintelligible to any person without employing a suitable
 decryption routine or algorithm. 

 "Decryption", the reverse process of  encryption,  so as to restore any
 data so  encrypted  to its original, human readable form. 

 "Routine or algorithm", any series of discrete steps in a computer,
 microprocessor, or calculator native machine language which is
 performed as a unit to  encrypt  or decrypt data, or to present such
 decrypted data on an end user display medium; provided, however, that
 it shall not include source code written in any human readable
 language.

 "End user display medium", a video display terminal or paper.

 "Source code", any programming language used to produce the native
 machine language described in the definition of "routine or
 algorithm". 

 "Authorized end user", any person, including a corporation,
 partnership, sole proprietorship, or governmental body for whose
 specific use the data in question is produced. If shall specifically
 exclude any person, including a corporation, partnership, sole
 proprietorship, or governmental body into or through whose possession
 said data may pass before reaching said authorized end user. 

 "Numeric data", symbols representing exclusively quantities.  It shall
 specifically exclude expressions containing number which represent
 nonnumeric entities including, but not limited to, social security
 numbers, license numbers, bank account numbers, street addresses, and
 the like.

 "Custodian", a person, including a corporation, partnership, sole
 proprietorship, or governmental body, that has access of any kind
 whatsoever to personal data files. 

 "Live data", any personal data which currently represents or at any
 time in the past had represented any actual person, including a
 corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship or such person's
 property.

 SECTION 2.  Personal data files within the commonwealth shall be
 encrypted.

 SECTION 3.  Decryption of  encrypted  data may be accomplished only by,
 for, or on behalf of the authorized end user of such data, and only to
 render such data into human readable form for the use of such
 authorized end user or an end user display medium.  Any intermediate
 storage or transmission of decrypted data in machine readable form
 shall be a violation of this chapter.

 SECTION 4.  Machine executable routines or algorithms used to decrypt
 encrypted  data shall reside only in those routines or algorithms which
 present the data to authorized end users upon end user media. Source
 code for such routines or algorithms shall reside only at the situs of
 the authorized end user or at the situs of a party engaged in the
 development or maintenance of said source code.  No party so engaged
 may use live data for any purpose whatsoever except as provided in this
 chapter.

 SECTION 5.  Any copy, excerpt, summary, extension, transmission, or
 other transfer of any personal data, whether or not originally
 encrypted,  shall be encrypted  during such transfer until it reaches
 the authorized end user.

 SECTION 6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
 numeric data may be stored in decrypted form during testing of summary
 or other numeric routines or algorithms in connection with development
 or maintenance of software whose purpose is the processing or display
 of such data for the use of the authorized end user, where such testing
 would be rendered impossible or unreasonably burdensome using
 encrypted  data.  For the purposes of this section, amounts used to
 calculate simple algebraic sums shall not qualify for decrypted storage
 under this section.

 SECTION 7.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any
 personal data which is stored and maintained exclusively or generally
 for the purpose of providing access to such data by the public shall be
 exempted for the encryption  requirements this chapter.  The exemption
 provided hereby shall extend to excerpts, and compilations of such
 data, however and by whomever used.  Any and all other data from other
 sources which are not specifically exempted under this section or under
 sections nine or ten shall be  encrypted, whether or not merged,
 appended, inserted, or otherwise attached to exempted data, and are
 subject to all of the provisions of this chapter in the same manner as
 if such exempted data did not exist.

 SECTION 8.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any
 routines or algorithms used for the decryption of  encrypted  data may
 be provided to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for the purpose
 of assuring compliance with various national, state, and local laws.
 For the purposes of this section, such law enforcement agencies shall
 be considered authorized end users.

 SECTION 9.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any
 person may waive the protections afforded by this chapter. Evidence of
 such waiver must be given in writing by such person to each custodian
 of data pertaining to said person.  When more than one person is
 entitled to protection under this chapter, by virtue of joint ownership
 or other such relationship, no waiver shall be effective unless signed
 by all parties so involved.  Such waiver shall be construed to waive
 protection only with respect to the specific kinds or elements of
 information enumerated on its face, and shall operate to exclude only
 encryption  of said data by the particular custodian of such data as is
 named in said waiver and in whose possession to waiver is kept. The
 waiver may operate in perpetuity or be limited to a particular time.
 Any ambiguities in any waiver given under this section shall be
 resolved in favor of encryption of the most data colorable under its
 terms.

 SECTION 10.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
 decrypted data may be stored in a secure location apart from the situs
 of any user of such data, provided that the sole purpose to which such
 data shall be put shall be to restore data which has been lost or
 corrupted. Any routines or algorithms used to restore used files using
 said decrypted data shall employ  encryption rountines or algorithms as
 required by this chapter.  For the purposes of this section, decryption
 routines or algorithms may be considered lost or corrupted if a
 reasonable belief exists that security employed in the custody of such
 routines or algorithms has been breached.

 SECTION 11.  Reasonable security shall be employed by persons in the
 management of the routines and algorithms used for the  encryption  and
 decryption of data, as required by this chapter. Such secuirty shall
 consist as a minimum in the storage of such routines and algorithms at
 one situs and the nature and location of its associated data at
 another.

 Review by Scott Davis (dfox@fennec.com)

 If you only buy one book this year, make sure it is INFORMATION WARFARE!
 In my 10+ years of existing in cyberspace and seeing people and organizatons
 debate, argue and contemplate security issues, laws, personal privacy,
 and solutions to all of these issues...and more, never have I seen a more
 definitive publication. In INFORMATION WARFARE,  Winn Schwartau simply
 draws the line on the debating. The information in this book is hard-core,
 factual documentation that leaves no doubt in this reader's mind that
 the world is in for a long, hard ride in regards to computer security.
 The United States is open to the world's electronic terrorists.
 When you finish reading this book, you will find out just how open we are.
 
 Mr. Schwartau talks about industrial espionage, hacking, viruses, 
 eavesdropping, code-breaking, personal privacy, HERF guns, EMP/T bombs,
 magnetic weaponry, and the newest phrase of our generation...
 "Binary Schizophrenia". He exposes these topics from all angles. If you
 spend any amount of time in Cyberspace, this book is for you.

 How much do you depend on technology? 

 ATM machines, credit cards, toasters, VCR's, televisions, computers,
 telephones, modems...the list goes on. You use technology and computers
 and don't even know it! But the point is...just how safe are you from
 invasion? How safe is our country's secrets? The fact is - they are NOT
 SAFE! How easy is it for someone you don't know to track your every move
 on a daily basis? VERY EASY! Are you a potential victim to fraud,
 breech of privacy, or general infractions against the way you carry
 on your daily activities? YES! ...and you'd never guess how vulnerable
 we all are!

 This book will take you deep into places the government refuses to 
 acknowledge. You should know about INFORMATION WARFARE. Order your
 copy today, or pick it up at your favorite book store. You will not
 regret it.

                              HACKER BARBIE

TO: Editors@fennec.com
Subject: 'Hacker' Barbie...

 (LA, California) Mattel announces their new line of Barbie products, the 
 "Hacker Barbie." These new dolls will be released next month. The aim of 
 these dolls is to revert the stereotype that women are numerophobic, 
 computer-illiterate, and academically challenged.
     
 This new line of Barbie dolls comes equipped with Barbie's very own 
 xterminal and UNIX documentation as well as ORA's "In a Nutshell" series. 
 The Barbie is robed in a dirty button-up shirt and a pair of worn-out jeans 
 with Casio all-purpose watches and thick glasses that can set ants on fire. 
 Pocket protectors and HP calculators optional.  The new Barbie has the 
 incredible ability to stare at the screen without blinking her eyes and to 
 go without eating or drinking for 12 hours straight. Her vocabulary mainly 
 consists of technical terms such as "IP address," "TCP/IP," "kernel," 
 "NP-complete," and "Alpha AXP's."
     
 "We are very excited about this product," said John Olson, Marketting 
 Executive, "and we hope that the Hacker Barbie will offset the damage 
 incurred by the mathophobic Barbie." A year ago, Mattel released Barbie 
 dolls that say, "Math is hard," with condescending companions Ken. The 
 Hacker Barbie's Ken is an incompetent consultant who frequently asks Barbie 
 for help.
     
 The leading feminists are equally excited about this new line of Barbie 
 dolls. Naomi Wuuf says, "I believe that these new dolls will finally 
 terminate the notion that women are inherently inferior when it comes to 
 mathematics and the sciences. However, I feel that Ken's hierarchical 
 superiority would simply reinforce the patriarchy and oppress the masses." 
 Mattel made no comment.
     
 Parents, however, are worried that they would become technologically behind 
 by comparison to the children when the Hacker Barbie comes out. "My daughter 
 Jenny plays with the prototype Hacker Barbie over yonder for two days," says 
 Mrs. Mary Carlson of Oxford, Mississippi, "and as y'all know, she now pays 
 my credit card bill. Ain't got no idea how she duz it, but she surely duz 
 it. I jus don't wanna be looked upon as a dumb mama." Mattel will be 
 offering free training courses for those who purchase the Hacker Barbie.
     
 The future Hacker Barbie will include several variations to deal with the 
 complex aspects of Barbie. "Hacker Barbie Goes to Jail" will teach computer 
 ethics to youngsters, while "BARB1E R1TES L1KE BIFF!!!" will serve as an 
 introduction to expository writing.

 Introduction

   The Internet serves as a routing matrix for electronic mail 
 messages, file transfers and information searches.  Internet 
 sites, those machines and sub-networks that are "internetworked", 
 have thus far served mostly as file archives, email 
 addresses and administrative caretakers for their locally 
 serviced users.  Historically, these sites have been universities, 
 corporations or military and government installations.  With 
 the popularization and commercialization of the Internet, new 
 models of Internet sites are connecting to the web of high 
 speed data lines.  

   One unique Internet site, accessible by anyone with an Internet 
 account, is The Whole Earth Lectronic Link (hereafter referred to 
 by its popular name, The WELL).  In the future, the Internet will 
 certainly feature many small, homegrown, regional commercial 
 systems like The WELL.  Such systems will pay for their own 
 operations and for their Internet connections through user fees, 
 handling all of the billing and administrative tasks relating to their 
 users, developing their own local community standards of behavior 
 and interaction.  Their users will often leave the "home" system, 
 going out through Internet gateways to other regional systems or 
 searching for information in the myriad databases of the Net.  Internet 
 voyagers will drop in to visit the unique communities they find 
 outside their home systems, sampling the local cultural flavors and 
 meeting and conversing with the individuals who inhabit those 
 systems.  

   The main attractions of these local Internet "towns" will prove to be 
 their characteristic online conversations and social conventions and
 their focus on specialized fields of knowledge or problem solving.  
 The WELL is a seminal example of what these small pioneering 
 towns on the Internet highway system will be like.

   The WELL is a computer-mediated public conferencing and 
 email system linked to the Internet through BARRNet, the 
 regional Internet vendor.  The WELL's  headquarters are 
 located in Sausalito, California.  It is co-owned by Point 
 Foundation (producers of Whole Earth Review and the Whole 
 Earth Catalogs) and Rosewood Stone, a financial investment 
 company owned the founder and ex-owner of Rockport Shoes.

   The WELL was, from its founding in 1985 until January of 
 1992, accessible to its users only via direct or packet switched 
 dialup.  It had carried stored-and-forwarded USENET news 
 groups since soon after startup.  These files were imported via 
 regular phone links with Internet-connected sites.  Among its 
 users were some small minority of students, academics and 
 technical professionals with Internet accounts on other 
 systems.  The feasibility of the WELL connecting to the Internet 
 increased steadily through the 1980s until financial, technical 
 and political conditions allowed it to happen.  It is significant, 
 though, that the character of the WELL developed under 
 conditions of relative network isolation.  Indeed, part of the 
 justification given by BARRNet, the regional Internet service 
 provider, for allowing a commercial system like the WELL to 
 connect through their facilities was the unique character of the 
 WELL as an established system with thriving and interesting 
 discussion, and its perceived value as a an information-
 generating resource for the Net.  The WELL would, they 
 figured, make an interesting and potentially rewarding 
 stopover on any user's Internet Tour.

   The WELL is often associated with the term "online 
 community".  The idea that community can develop through 
 online interaction is not unique to the WELL.  But the WELL, 
 because of its organizational and technical history, has survived  
 primarily through the online personal interaction of its 
 subscribers and staff rather than through successful business 
 strategy developed by its owners and managers.  The 
 discussion and dialog contained and archived on the WELL are 
 its primary products.  The WELL "sells its users to each other" 
 and it considers its users to be both its consumers and its 
 primary producers.  Databases of imported information and 
 libraries full of downloadable software are scarcely present.  
 Third-party services such as stock-trading news, wire services, 
 airline reservation access and software vendor support have 
 never been offered to any significant extent.

   The WELL today counts around 7,000 paying subscribers.  It 
 has a growing staff of over 12 and a gross annual income 
 approaching $2 million.  It is a small but healthy business and 
 has historically spent very little on advertising and promotion.  
 It gets far more than its share of free publicity and notoriety 
 through the Press coverage as compared to much larger 
 commercial systems.  This is so in spite of what most people 
 would consider a "user-hostile" interface and relatively high 
 pricing.

   The WELL had a rather unique upbringing.  I will describe its 
 early growth and the foundations of its character in the rest of 
 this paper.  I do this from the point of view of having been the 
 person in charge for six years, though I took great pains to de-
 emphasize the "in charge" part whenever possible.  I tried to 
 focus more on maintenance and the distribution of responsibility 
 through the user community rather than on control.   Though my 
 record for making the WELL a technical showpiece is not 
 without blemish, my main emphasis was in preserving 
 and supporting the exercise of freedom and creativity by the 
 WELL's users through providing an open forum for their interaction.

   It is my assertion that the actual exercise of free speech and 
 assembly in online interaction is among the most significant 
 and important uses of electronic networking; and that the value 
 of this practice to the nation and to the world may prove 
 critical at this stage in human history.  I regard the WELL as a 
 sample of the kind of small, diverse, grassroots service 
 provider that can and should exist in profusion, mutually accessible 
 through the open channels on the Internet.  

   The possibility that the future "Internet" (or whatever replaces 
 it) may be dominated by monolithic corporate-controlled 
 electronic consumer shopping malls and amusement parks is 
 antithetical to the existence and activity of free individuals in 
 the electronic communications world, each one able to interact 
 freely with other individuals and groups there.

A Very Brief Biography of the WELL

   Founded in 1985 by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant as a 
 partnership of Point and NETI , the WELL came online in 
 February of 1985 and began taking paying customers April 1, 
 1985.  It's initial staff of one full-time and one part-time 
 employee grew to 12 paid employees and well over one 
 hundred online volunteers by 1992.   As of this date, The WELL 
 runs on a Sequent multi- processor mini-computer located in a 
 cramped room in a small office building next to the houseboat 
 docks in Sausalito, California.  The WELL has full Internet 
 connectivity which is currently offered for the use of its 
 subscribers at no surcharge.  Most users call in to the WELL 
 over regular phone lines and modems., and most long distance 
 customers reach the WELL using an X.25 commercial packet 
 network for an additional $4.00 per hour.  An increasing 
 number of users are logging in to the WELL via the Internet, 
 many using Internet accounts on commercial gatewayed 
 systems rather than the packet switching nets.

   The WELL's notable achievements are many, not the least of 
 which is that it has survived for eight years while so many 
 other startup systems, though much better-funded, have failed.  
 The Electronic Frontier Foundation was born largely out of the 
 free speech ferment that exists on the WELL and out of 
 discussions and debate that go on there concerning the unique 
 legal and regulatory paradoxes that confront users, managers 
 and owners of systems in this new communications medium.  
 These discussions also attract a population of journalists who 
 find cutting edge ideas and concepts arising constantly in the 
 WELL's forums.  Many other formal and informal organizations 
 and collaborations that are effecting the world today call the 
 WELL home.  

The WELL Story -- a Less Brief Biography

 Birth
 
   The WELL was the conceptual and partnered creation of Larry 
 Brilliant and Stewart Brand.  They agreed to have their 
 respective organizations cooperate in establishing and 
 operating a computer conferencing network that could serve as 
 a prototype for many regional (as opposed to national) 
 commercial systems.   "Let a thousand CompuServe's bloom," is 
 how Brilliant put it.

   Initial funding came from Brilliant's company, Networking 
 Technologies International (NETI) in the form of a leased VAX 
 11/750 computer and hard disks, UNIX system software, a 
 "conferencing" program called Picospan, and a loan of $90,000.  
 Point Foundation, the non-profit parent corporation of Whole 
 Earth Review,  contributed the name recognition of "Whole 
 Earth", the personal attraction of having Stewart Brand to 
 converse with online and the modest but important 
 promotional value of constant mention in the small circulation 
 but influential "Whole Earth Review" magazine.

   Business goals for The WELL were, from its inception, 
 purposefully flexible.  But the idea that interesting discussion 
 would attract interesting discussants was at the core of the 
 theory that drove the WELL's growth.  Initially, many free 
 accounts were offered to people who had, at one time or 
 another, been associated with Whole Earth publications and 
 events, or who were known by Whole Earth staff to be likely 
 productive and attractive participants (referred to, tongue-in-
 cheek, as "shills").  In April of 1985, the WELL began offering 
 subscriptions at $8 per month plus $3 per hour.

Initial Design and Rule making

    The WELL presented its first users with the sole disclaimer:   
 "You own your own words."  The owners of the WELL sought to 
 distance themselves from liability for any text or data posted 
 or stored online by WELL users while, at the same time, 
 providing a free space for creative, experimental and 
 unfettered communication.  An alternative interpretation of the 
 original disclaimer (now referred to as YOYOW) held that rather 
 than only laying responsibility for WELL postings at the feet of 
 the author, the phrase also imparted copyrighted ownership of 
 postings to the author under the implied protection and 
 enforcement of the WELL.  Management and ownership 
 resisted the onus of their serving as legal agent for the WELL's  
 users, recognizing the potential expense and futility of pursuing 
 people for electronically copying and using customers' words.  
 Thus, the evolving interpretation of YOYOW provided fuel for 
 years' worth of discussion on the topics of copyright,  
 intellectual property and manners in electronic space.  

   A general aversion to the making and enforcement of rigid 
 rules has continued at the WELL although incendiary incidents 
 and distressing situations have occasionally brought calls for 
 "more Law and Order" or absolute limits to speech.  WELL 
 management rejected these calls, resisting being put in the role 
 of policeman and judge except where absolutely necessary, and 
 espousing the view that the medium of online interpersonal 
 communication was (and still is) too immature, too formative to 
 be confined by the encumbrances of strict rules and 
 restrictive software.  The imposition by management of 
 arbitrary limitations on language and speech, aimed at 
 protecting the feelings or sensibilities of small groups of people 
 could not possibly protect all people's feelings and sensibilities.  
 Besides, by stifling free and open dialog, we might have lost 
 our chance to discover what kinds of interaction really worked 
 in this medium.  Interaction in public access systems seemed to 
 be much more productive, innovative, educational and 
 entertaining where there were fewer prohibitions imposed by 
 system management.  If limitations were to be imposed and 
 enforced, they could be handled best from within the user 
 population on a "local", not system wide basis.  The creation of 
 private interactive areas where such local rules held sway 
 allowed public forums to retain their openness while providing 
 more regulated "retreats" for those who felt they needed them. 

 Staff-Customer Collaboration
 
    Immediately after opening the system to public access, the 
 small WELL staff and the original participants began the 
 collaborative process of designing of a more friendly interface 
 from the raw Picospan software.  Picospan included a toolbox of 
 customization utilities that could be used to make changes on a 
 system-wide or at-user's-option basis.  Picospan was tightly-
 integrated with the UNIX operating system and could therefore 
 provide transparent access to programs written to operate in 
 the UNIX environment.  The libertarian, anti-authoritarian 
 philosophy of Picospan's author, Marcus Watts, showed through 
 in its design which prevented un-acknowledged censorship by 
 system administrators, forum moderators (hosts) or authors 
 themselves.  Picospan also allowed topics (discussion threads) 
 to be "linked" into several forums at once...a feature that aids 
 the cross-pollination of ideas and groups through the system.  
 The influence that Picospan has had on the WELL's 
 development as a community and hotbed of discussion cannot 
 be underestimated.  Its display of topics as continuously-
 scrolling dialog documents (rather than as fragmented 
 collections of individually-displayed responses) had a 
 tremendous effect on user involvement in ongoing discourse.

 Staff Background

    The background of four of The WELL's non-technical senior 
 managers--people who worked there during its first seven 
 years--must be considered very significant to the formation of 
 the WELL's open and independent culture.

   The first director of the WELL, Matthew McClure and myself, 
 his successor, both spent the decade of the 1970's living in an 
 intentional community of some renown called The Farm as did 
 the WELL's first customer service manager, John Coate, and his 
 successor, Nancy Rhine..  Undoubtedly, this experience of living 
 cooperatively in multi-family situations in a community that 
 reached a peak population of over 1500 adults and children, 
 had a profound influence on the style of management of The 
 WELL.  Principles of tolerance and inclusion, fair resource 
 allocation, distributed responsibility, management by example 
 and influence, a flat organizational hierarchy, cooperative 
 policy formulation and acceptance of a libertarian-bordering-
 on-anarchic ethos were all carryovers from our communal 
 living experience.  John Coate is known for having been integral 
 to the setting of a tone of the WELL where users and staff 
 intermingled both online and at the WELL's monthly office 
 parties.  He has authored a widely-distributed essay on 
 "Cyberspace Innkeeping" based on lessons learned in dealing 
 with customers in his time at the WELL..

 Maintaining a History
 
    An important component to the establishment of community in 
 any setting or medium is a historical record of its environs, its 
 people, and their works and the relationships and organizations 
 that defined the direction of the collective entity.  For a variety 
 of reasons besides the security of backups,  the WELL still has a 
 significant portion of its online interaction saved on archived 
 tape, on its user-accessible disks and in the possession of many 
 of its conference hosts who have made a practice of backing up 
 topics on their home machines before retiring them from the 
 WELL.  WELL users were always vocal in their insistence that a 
 history be kept and went so far as to create an Archives 
 conference where topics judged of historical significance from 
 other areas of the WELL were linked and eventually "frozen"  
 for future reference.  These valuable conversational threads, 
 this "history" of the WELL, contributes to its depth and feeling 
 of place and community.  New users and veterans alike can 
 refer to these archives for background to current discussion 
 and to sample the flavor of the WELL from its early days.  
 When new users, experiencing the same revelations that 
 stirred WELL veterans years ago, bring up their own 
 interpretations of "you own your words", they are referred to  
 the several preserved topics in Archives where lengthy online 
 deliberations on the subject have been preserved..

 Connections
 
    Originally, only direct dial modems could be used to reach the 
 WELL, but by the end of its first year of operation, an X.25 
 packet system was in place allowing long distance users to 
 reach the WELL at reasonable cost.  The WELL kept its San 
 Francisco focus because local callers had cheaper access and 
 could stay online longer for the same cost, but national and 
 international participants were now more encouraged to join in.

    Also, in 1986, Pacific Bell conducted a test of a regional packet-
 switched network for which the WELL was enrolled as a "beta" 
 site.  For most of a year, users from most of the San Francisco 
 Bay Area were able to dial in to the WELL without phone toll 
 charges.  This fortuitous circumstance helped boost the WELL's 
 subscription base and connected many valuable customers 
 from the Silicon Valley area into the growing user pool.

    Over time, the percentage of users from outside of the Bay 
 Area climbed slowly but steadily.  As word spread through 
 frequent unsolicited articles in the press, the WELL became 
 known as a locus for cutting edge discussion of technical, 
 literary and community issues, and it became even more 
 attractive to long distance telecommunicators. 

    On January 2, 1992, the WELL opened its connection to the 
 Internet through the regional provider, BARRNet.  After much 
 debugging and adjustment and a complete CPU upgrade, full 
 Internet service access was offered to WELL customers in June 
 of 1992.  Staff and users opened an Internet conference on the 
 WELL where discussions and Q&A take place and where new 
 features, discoveries and tools are shared.  The Internet 
 conference serves as a "living manual" to the resources, use and 
 news of the Net.

 Community
 
    In a medium where text is the only means of communication, 
 trust becomes one of the most difficult but essential things to 
 build and maintain.  With no audible or visual clues to go by, 
 the bandwidth for interpersonal communication is quite thin.  
 There are, though, ways in which trust can be built even 
 through the small aperture of telecommunicated text.

    By being deliberately non-threatening, owners and managers can 
 eliminate one of the major barriers to trust on the system.  One of the 
 most menacing conditions experienced by new users of public 
 conferencing systems is that of hierarchical uncertainty.  Who holds 
 the Power?  What is their agenda?  What are The Rules?  Who is 
 watching me and what I do?  Do I have any privacy?  How might a 
 "Big Brother" abuse me and my rights?  The WELL Whole Earth 
 parentage brought with it a historical reputation of collaboration 
 between publisher and reader.  Whole Earth catalogs and magazines 
 were widely-known for soliciting and including articles and reviews 
 written by their readers.  Whole Earth customers knew that the 
 publications had no ulterior motives, were not owned and controlled 
 by multi-national corporations and did not spend their revenues on 
 making anyone rich.  Readers supported the publications and the 
 publications featured and came clean with the readers.  We strove to 
 continue that kind of relationship with our customers on the WELL 
 although the immediacy of feedback often made openness a tricky 
 proposition.

    We realized that we were in a position of ultimate power 
 as operators of the system; able to create and destroy user 
 accounts, data, communications at will.  It was incumbent on 
 us, then, to make clear to all users our assumptions and the 
 ground rules of the WELL in order to minimize any concerns 
 they might have about our intentions.  Our aim was to be as 
 much out front with users as possible.  Indeed, John Coate 
 and I took the initiative, posting long autobiographical stories 
 from our communal past, inviting users to join us in problem-
 solving discussions about the system and the business around 
 it, confessing to areas of ignorance and lack of experience in the 
 technical end of the business, and actively promoting the users 
 themselves as the most important creators of the WELL's 
 product.

   Staff members were encouraged to be visible online and to be 
 active listeners to user concerns in their respective areas of 
 responsibility.  Staff took part in discussions not only about 
 technical matters and customer service, but about 
 interpersonal online ethics.  When the inevitable online 
 quarrels surfaced, staff participated alongside users in 
 attempts to resolve them.  Over time, both staff and users 
 learned valuable lessons and a "core group" of users began to 
 coalesce around the idea that some kind of community was 
 forming and that it could survive these periodic emotional 
 firestorms.  The ethical construct that one could say whatever 
 one wanted to on the WELL, but that things worked best if it 
 was said with consideration of others in mind, became 
 ingrained in enough peoples' experience that community 
 understandings developed.  These "standards" were not written 
 down as rules, but are noted conspicuously in the WELL's User 
 Manual and are mentioned online as observations of how 
 things really seem to work.  Productive communication in this 
 medium can take place if it is done with care.

    Beginning in 1986, the WELL began sponsoring monthly face-
 to-face gatherings open to all, WELL user or not.  Initially, 
 these Friday night parties were held in the WELL's small 
 offices, but as attendance grew and the offices became even 
 more cramped, the potluck gatherings, still called WELL Office 
 Parties (or WOPs) moved to other locations, eventually finding 
 a regular home at the Presidio Yacht Club near the foot of the 
 North end of the Golden Gate Bridge.  These in-person 
 encounters have been an integral and important part of the 
 WELL's community-building.  They are energetic, intense, 
 conversation-saturated events where people who communicate 
 through screen and keyboard day after day get to refresh 
 themselves with the wider bandwidth of physical presence.  
 Often, the face to face encounter has served to resolve 
 situations where the textual communications have broken 
 down between people. 

 Collaboration Part II
 
    The WELL was a bootstrap operation from its initial investment 
 in 1985.  As a business venture, it was undercapitalized and 
 struggled constantly to stay ahead of its growth in terms of its 
 technical infrastructure and staffing.  At the same time, it stuck 
 to the ideal of charging its users low fees for service.  The 
 undercapitalization of the WELL and the low user charges 
 combined to force management into a constant state of creative 
 frugality.  From the first days of operation, the expertise and 
 advice of users was enlisted to help maintain the UNIX 
 operating system, to write documentation for the conferencing 
 software, to make improvements in the interface and to deal 
 with the larger problems such as hardware malfunctions and 
 upgrades.

   Over the years, many tools have been invented, programmed 
 and installed at the suggestion of or through the actual labor of 
 WELL users.  In an ongoing attempt to custom design the 
 interface so as to offer a comfortable environment for any user, 
 the WELL has become, if not a truly user-friendly environment, 
 a very powerful tool kit for the online communications 
 enthusiast.  One of the basic tenets of the WELL is that "tools, 
 not rules" are preferred solutions to most people-based  
 problems.  Menu-driven tools were created to give control of 
 file privacy to users, allowing them to make their files 
 publicly-readable or invisible to others.  The "Bozo filter", 
 created by a WELL user, allows any user to choose not to see 
 the postings of any other user.  Some WELL veterans, after 
 years of teeth-gritting tolerance of an abrasive individual, can 
 now be spared any online exposure to or encounter with that 
 individual.

    Other tools have been written to facilitate file transfers, to 
 allow easy setup of USENET group lists, to find the cheapest 
 ways to access the WELL, and to extract portions of online 
 conversations based on a wide range of criteria.  These tools 
 have all been written  by WELL users, who received only free online 
 time in exchange for their work, or by WELL employees who were 
 once customers.

    Free time on the WELL (comptime) has always been awarded 
 liberally by WELL management in exchange for services.  At 
 one time, half of the hours logged on the WELL in a month was 
 uncharged, going to comptime volunteers or staff.  Hosting 
 conferences, writing software, consulting on technical issues 
 and simply providing interesting and provocative conversation 
 have all earned users free time on the WELL.  Much as we 
 would have liked to pay these valuable people for their 
 services, almost to a person they have continued to contribute 
 to the WELL's success as a business and public forum, 
 demonstrating to us that they considered the trade a fair one.

 Conclusion
  
   As can be seen, the WELL developed from its unusual roots in 
 some unique ways.  The purpose of this piece is not to advocate 
 more WELL clones on the Net, but to demonstrate that if the 
 WELL could make it, other systems of the WELL's size and 
 general description could spawn from equally unique 
 circumstances around the country and offer their own special 
 cultural treasures to the rest of the world through the Internet.  
 What has been learned at the WELL can certainly be of value 
 when planning new systems because the WELL experiment has 
 demonstrated that big funding bucks, elegant interface design, 
 optimum hardware  and detailed business planning are not 
 essential to growing a thriving online community and, in the 
 WELL's case, a successful for-profit business.  More important 
 is that the owners and managers of the systems openly foster 
 the growth of online community and that there be a strong 
 spirit of open collaboration between owners, managers and 
 users in making the system succeed.  These critical elements of 
 viable community systems are attainable by local and regional 
 civic networks, small organizations and entrepreneurs with 
 limited funding and technical skills... and some heart.

                 THE FEMINIZATION OF CYBERSPACE

 by Doctress Neutopia (neutopia@educ.umass.edu)

     During the final year of my doctoral work I discovered the new
 world of Cyberspace.  Having been involved in utopian thought for
 more than fifteen years, inventing my own utopia from the ideas of
 such futurists and architects as Charlotte Perkins Gilman,
 Starhawk, Eiane Eisler, Paolo Soleri, Buckminster Fuller, etc,
 which I call Neutopia, I find the world of virtual reality is the
 perfect place for my Neutopian imagination be to born into reality.
 The central nervous system of Neutopia is the evolving Global Brain
 which we are now seeing come about through information technologies
 and the world of Cyberspace.
     
     Cyberspace is changing the very nature of text.  Electronic
 text takes us into the age of non-text which means writing has
 become solely an electronic experience requiring no paper form. 
 Printed matter is no longer necessary in the world of Cyberspace. 
 In this world today, the power of ideas, and to some degree one's
 writing style and skills is the persuader. In the ideal sense,
 Cyberspace becomes a place for the autonomous individual, a place
 where the integrity of the Self is the determining factor of social
 prestige.  With the elimination of printed matter and the
 decentralized nature of email, a new relationship between
 authoress/author and audience is opening up.  Editors who have had
 the centralized control over the printed word are no longer the all
 powerful controller of literature since in Cyberspace the unknown
 poetess can post a message along side a literary giant.  Because of
 the democratizing aspects of the Usenet open forum, the matter in
 which one gains social status is also changing.  In Cyberspace,   
 literary merit is achieved through the depth and sincerity of one's
 message.  In other words, the old hierarchal structures of language
 and the old gatekeepers of ideas are being broken down as you read
 these words.
 
     Nevertheless, Cyberspace is no paradise on Earth.  Quite the
 contrary!  I don't believe I am being an extremist to say that
 there is a war against the feminist voice occurring in Cyberspace. 
 The Net term for such activity, which most of the postings of the
 discussion groups reflect, is called "flaming."  For me, the flames
 symbolize the "Burning Times" when civilization was moving from the
 Medieval Ages into the Renaissance and the rise the market economy.
 It was during this rebirth of classical thought when thousands of
 innocent women healers and religious leaders were being burned as
 heretics.
  
     A biologist friend has also pointed out to me that in his
 laboratory "flaming" means to sterilized a test tube from bacteria.
 In that sense, I feel that the "flaming" of my posts have been an
 attempt by some people to cleanse the Net from my non-conformist
 "disease".  After all, the Gaia Religion which I have been
 researching is about the role bacteria play in regulating life and
 love!

     Entering into the Computer Age, we find ourselves in another
 social transition.  The technological possibilities for
 revolutionary change on a world-wide level are now available to us.
 That is, if feminist ideology can come to the forefront of the
 dialogue.  Now, of course, as in the "real" world, the patriarchal
 religion of Capitalism is the dominant thought.  Anyone who opposes
 this thought are "flamed" for their "inappropriate behavior".  On
 many occasions, I have been "flamed" for my alternative Neutopian
 Vision, not by one individual, but by various Usenet and Listserve
 groups. 
 
     For example, I am subscribed to a Listserve called
 Leri@pyramid.com.  This group has about 200 people who are
 subscribed. There are two kinds of people on the myriad of
 Listserves, the Writers and the Lurkers.  Lurkers are people who
 compose the reading audience who occasionally voice an opinion, but
 for the most part, they are silent observers.  Of the writers, the
 majority are white upperly-mobile middle-class young men who are
 computer literate.  Many of them are from the scientific class who
 are busy creating the Technocracy.  When I began to point out the
 blatant sexist language and attitudes on Leri, I was "flamed" by
 members of this so called "virtual love commune." 
 
     We are seeing here a rise of a new form of tribalism.  If the
 tribal leaders (the Patriarchal Writers) sense a voice which might
 be threatening to the tribal harmony of the old-boys network, then
 the group attempts to eliminate that voice in opposition. 
 Unfortunately, for the most part, the educational system has not
 taught these young men to analyze and understand the reason why the
 feminist voice is annoying to their Establishment prevailing
 thought. Consequently, the Net has become but another sophisticated
 toy for rich minded college kids to entertain each other as the
 rest of the world starves to death and the global ecology
 collapses.

     There was much discussion which arose on Listserve Leri as to
 what to do about me.  Several writers declared my vision to be a
 "case of insanity." They even were discussing whether it was a case
 of biological or psychological aberration.  Others suggested that
 I needed to go to the self-help section of a book store and find a
 book which would help me fit into the society.  Others felt my
 "unhappy and depressed" character was a result of "inner confusion"
 and that if I changed myself [conform to their way of thinking],
 then I would be "liberated from oppression".  Still others believed
 that I would be saved if I found my way back to Christ or began to
 practice Buddhist meditation or yoga.
  
     Finally, it was decided that the best thing they could do with
 my heresy was to follow the example of the Shaker Community.  The
 worst punishment the Shakers did to a dissenting personality was to
 shun them and so this was what Listserve Leri proceeded to do to
 me.  Other technicians proposed to bar me by setting up the
 technology called "kill filters" so that my email messages would
 not even appear on their screens.
  
     There is also a IRC #leri channel where I began to go to
 explain my philosophy to the students in Real Time. When the
 conversation began to become controversial and conflicting ideas
 were pecking, the boys and the girls who think like boys, would
 type in an /ignore all neutopia messages so that I was blocked from
 the public dialogue.  Another tactic of censorship in IRC is the
 /kick ban which several of the boys threaten to set up so that I
 would not be kicked off the channel if I tried to enter it.  So
 much for democracy on the Net!

     During the holidays, Leri was going to hold a "fleshmeet" in
 New Mexico which all the members of the Leri Listserve were invited
 to so that people could meet one another in the living flesh. 
 However, when I expressed interested in attending the party, the
 hostess said that if I came "she would have me shot."  Then she
 wrote me a personal email with a one line message to the effect of
 "The Patriarchy Wins."  I was experiencing social ostracism for my
 feminist beliefs and it was a very loney and painful experience.

     But the worst treatment of all occurred on a sister list of
 Leri called Aleph@pyramid.com when the archivist said that he was
 deleting my posts from the archives.  This action was so malicious
 because I know this is what has happened to feminist thought
 throughout recorded history.  Women who resist the patriarchy are
 eliminated from the collective memory.  I recall a past life when
 I was being burned at the stake and the governmental/religious
 officials laughed at me as my flesh burned.  Before I fell
 unconscious from the smoke, the sinister officials took out my
 manuscripts which they had confiscated and threw them in the fire. 
 The messages of my life burned along with my body...my soul
 forgotten....my work unacknowledged...my poetic love verse
 destroyed. 
 
     The point is that there is a serious ideological war in
 progress in this underworld of Cyberspace, a place which also
 controls the nuclear weapons of the world through the Computer
 Empire.  This war is the same war which women have been struggling
 against for thousands of years.  As the millennium changes, so too
 is it time to end this war which is draining our vital resources
 that are needed to save the Biosphere from total destruction. It is
 time that women be acknowledged as the natural sovereigns of the
 species so that we will be in a position to use our knowledge and
 wisdom we have in creating a world where all our benevolent dreams
 find a way to self-actualize.

     My mission is to encourage Feminists to play an active role in
 the future of Cyberspace.  Here is a window of opportunity open for
 us to play our role essential in forming the future social
 architecture of Cyberspace.  If we, Feminists, do not act now and
 recruit other like minded Earthlings to take up the cause of the
 "Global Feminization of Cyberspace," then we will be caught in the
 same trap that we are in today.  It is time for us to demand a new
 world where everyone has access to the global resources...a world
 where everybody's spiritual and physical needs are met.  Only then
 will the Net become a vehicle of global emancipation and a home of
 the Neutopian thinker.

                  RESPONSE TO THE FEMINIZATION OF CYBERSPACE

 By Jason Webb (jwebb@world.std.com)

 I am writing in response to the article THE FEMINIZATION OF
 CYBERSPACE by Doctress Neutopia (neutopia@educ.umass.edu).  The issues
 raised and the accusations made in the article are very serious and
 deserve some discussion.  

 The author cites cases in which her opinions were repressed in several 
 different ways ranging from individual kill files to having her messages
 elminiated from the archives of the group.  It seems to me that the real
 issue at stake is what the purpose of the Listserve groups is. 

 Clearly, if the purpose of the group is to promote the free expression
 of ideas they are not succeeding.  It is true that the internet does eliminate
 discrimination based on physical characteriscics.  Predictably, however, 
 technology alone cannot create a better world: we have to be active in trying
 to create an environment where all ideas can be expressed without the fear of
 being ostracized.

 On the flip side, a few of the authors statements are disturbing
 because they imply that the male species is to blame for all of these
 problems.  For example:

 >When the conversation began to become controversial and conflicting ideas
 >were pecking, the boys and the girls who think like boys, would
 >type in an /ignore all neutopia messages so that I was blocked from
 >the public dialogue. 

 >It is time that women be acknowledged as the natural sovereigns of the
 >species so that we will be in a position to use our knowledge and
 >wisdom we have in creating a world where all our benevolent dreams
 >find a way to self-actualize.

 Girls who think like boys? Natural soverigns of the species?  

 It seems hypocritical that the author complains of experiencing
 ostracism for voicing her feminist beliefs and then goes on to make
 such exclusionary statements herself.

      THE EASY-TO-USE SOLVE THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION THEORY CHART

 By Gordon Fagan (flyer@fennec.com)

 Instructions:
 Write down the total # of persons involved.  Then write down the approximate 
 frame number of the Zapruder film that matches where you believe each shot 
 occurred.  Then it's a simple matter of going through the list and putting 
 an X under each shot number and beside each item that applies to that 
 particular shot.  If it doesn't apply, mark nothing.  If the item applies 
 but not to any particular shot number, then use the 0 shot#.  Mark  it with 
 an X for "conspiracy to kill" or an "O" for involved in the coverup (:It 
 also comes in handy for the "a tiger got him" crowd.:) I've tried to be as 
 thorough as possible, but to make sure everything was covered, I did leave 
 an "others" category with a fill-in-the-blank at the end of each section.  
 As for the exactness of your answers, use as close of approximations as you 
 feel comfortable with. Include all overlap, ie: if you believe Oswald fired 
 shot #4 but was under the command/control of Naval Intelligence - mark 
 Oswald and Naval Intelligence for shot #4.  For simultaneous shots, give 
 them both the same frame number.  It's pretty much self-explanatory once 
 you get into it.  Enjoy.

                          MEEKS DEFENSE FUND

From Meeks Defense Fund <fund@idi.net>
Subject: Details on Brock Meeks Case

Dear Net Citizen:
 
 The recent Internet posting launching a fund raising drive in
 order to help Brock Meeks defray the legal expenses of a lawsuit
 brought against his news wire, CyberWire Dispatch, has drawn
 several inquiries for a summary of the issues involved in this
 case.  In response, we have put together the following summary. 
 (Please note, too, that the case was featured in the April 22
 (Fri.) issue of the Wall St. Journal (page B1))

 Sometime during February of this year, an electronic solicitation
 began appearing on the Internet from a company identified only as
 the "Electronic Postal Service" (EPS).

 The solicitation from EPS said the service, "will pay you money
 to receive commercial e-mail. EPS estimates you will be paid an
 average of 6.5 cents per commercial e-mail message.  It is
 estimated that the average commercial e-mail receiver can make
 $200.00 to $500.00 a year and likely more.  There is absolutely
 no charge, periodic charge, hourly charge or phone charge to
 receive or review EPS commercial e-mail.  The sender bears all of
 the cost.

 You are provided with a free EPS mailbox and you may access this
 EPS mailbox through a toll free phone number so there are no
 phone line charges... In addition... EPS offers you... full
 Internet access including network Internet e-mail remote log-in,
 file transfer capability and much more."

 To sign up you were required to call an 800 number or send for
 information to the EPS Internet account (eps@world.std.com).  You
 had to include your name and address.
 
 Brock called and asked for the EPS information.  It never came.
 Instead, he received an unwanted and unsolicited direct mailing
 from a company called Suarez Corporation Industries (SCI).  The
 mailing came in the form of a 6 page letter signed by Benjamin
 Suarez.  That mailing claimed that for a price of $159, Suarez
 would send you a book and software that could help you create a
 "net profit generation system" capable of earning anywhere from
 $30,000 to $1 million per year.

 Brock began investigating why he received the SCI mailing and
 soon found out that Suarez had obtained his name from the request
 for EPS information. More investigation found that the EPS
 account was registered to Suarez Corporation Industries.  Brock
 then looked into the background of this company.

 During his investigation into SCI, Brock discovered that state
 and federal enforcement agencies had brought actions against SCI
 result of their direct mailing practices.
 
 In his article, Brock expressed his personal disapproval of the
 SCI business activities. SCI objected to the article and has
 filed a defamation lawsuit claiming Brock made defamatory remarks
 and sought to disparage his products "and otherwise tortiously
 (sic) interfere with the plaintiff's ability to develop" EPS. 
 Suarez claims the Dispatch article lost him business and he is
 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and demanding an
 injunction to block Brock from writing further about SCI or its
 founder, Benjamin Suarez.

 The April 22 (page B1) issue of the Wall St. Journal says lawsuit
 "is one of the first U.S. libel cases to arise out of the
 free-for-all on the Internet... If it succeeds, some legal
 experts say it could spawn other complaints."
 
 For those who don't know Brock, he has a long history as a
 journalist writing in the on-line field, having written for Byte,
 Wired and other journals over the years.  He lives and works
 today in the Washington, D.C. area writing during the day for a
 communications trade journal.  Cyberwire Dispatch is his own
 creation.  The suit against him was filed in Ohio.  Without
 the generous offer of legal support from his current lawyers, who
 have offices in Ohio, Brock's situation would be even more dire.
 
 The Meeks case raises legal issues that may have far-reaching
 implications for freedom of speech and free expression on the
 internet.  If journalists are unable to pursue important
 investigative issues without fear of reprisal, then
 all of us will suffer.  This is exactly the type of chilling
 effect hat the First Amendment was intended to avoid and the
 reason we need your support. 
 
 Of course defamation laws are to be applied to the Net, but how
 they are applied -- and this case will be an important first step
 in that process -- could determine just how open and free people
 will feel to speak their minds.
 
 This is NOT a case in which a writer on the Internet has, in
 fact, libeled someone else.  Brock absolutely denies the charges
 against him.  And every lawyer that Brock has consulted and
 looked at the text Brock wrote, and the charges against him,
 believe that he ha not written anything that can fairly be
 characterized as libelous.
 
 The Legal Defense Fund is formed to assure that Brock is well
 defended. 

 As a reminder, contributions can be made in two ways, either
 tax-deductible or non-deductible.
 
 A special thanks goes to the Point Foundation for agreeing early
 on in the process to assist in organizing and serving as a
 collection agent for the Fund.

                            HACKERS ON PLANET EARTH

 From: Emmanuel Goldstein (emmanuel@well.sf.ca.us)
 To: Editors@fennec.com

 HACKERS ON PLANET EARTH

 The First U.S. Hacker Congress

 Yes, it's finally happening. A hacker party unlike anything ever seen 
 before in this country. Come help us celebrate ten years of existence 
 and meet some really interesting and unusual people in the process. 
 We've rented out the entire top floor of a midtown New York hotel, 
 consisting of several gigantic ballrooms. The conference will run 
 around the clock all weekend long. 

 SPEAKERS AND SEMINARS: Will there be famous people and celebrity 
 hackers? Of course, but the real stars of this convention will be 
 the hundreds of hackers and technologically inclined people journeying 
 from around the globe to share information and get new ideas. 
 That is the real reason to show up. Seminars include: 
 social engineering, cellular phone cloning, cable TV security, 
 stealth technology and surveillance, lockpicking, boxing of all sorts, 
 legal issues, credit cards, encryption, the history of 2600, 
 password sniffing, viruses, scanner tricks, and many more in the 
 planning stages. Meet people from the Chaos Computer Club, Hack-Tic, 
 Phrack, and all sorts of other k-rad groups.

 THE NETWORK: Bring a computer with you and you can tie into the huge 
 Ethernet we'll be running around the clock. Show off your system and 
 explore someone else's (with their permission, of course). We will 
 have a reliable link to the Internet in addition. Finally, everyone 
 attending will get an account on our hope.net machine. We encourage 
 you to try and hack root. We will be giving away some valuable prizes 
 to the successful penetrators, including the keys to a 1994 Corvette. 
 (We have no idea where the car is, but the keys are a real 
 conversation piece.) Remember, this is only what is currently planned. 
 Every week, something new is being added so don't be surprised to find 
 even more hacker toys on display. We will have guarded storage areas 
 if you don't want to leave your equipment unattended.

 VIDEOS: We will have a brand new film on hackers called 
 "Unauthorized Access", a documentary that tells the story from 
 our side and captures the hacker world from Hamburg to Los Angeles 
 and virtually everywhere in between. In addition, we'll have 
 numerous foreign and domestic hacker bits, documentaries, 
 news stories, amateur videos, and security propaganda. There 
 has been a lot of footage captured over the years - this will 
 be a great opportunity to see it all. We will also have one 
 hell of an audio collection, including prank calls that put 
 The Jerky Boys to shame, voice mail hacks, and even confessions 
 by federal informants! It's not too late to contribute material!

 WHERE/WHEN: It all happens Saturday, August 13th and Sunday, 
 August 14th at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City 
 (Seventh Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets, right across 
 the street from Penn Station). If you intend to be part of

     TV & MOVIE MANIA RADIO SHOW HITS THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

 By Lauren Weinstein (lauren@vortex.com)

 LOS ANGELES -- In a first for an entertainment-oriented show, a
 version of the popular "Professor Neon's TV & Movie Mania" radio
 program begins worldwide distribution directly to listeners this
 week via the Internet (or as it is becoming popularly known,
 the "Information Superhighway").

 "The Internet now includes over 20 million users in more than 30
 countries, and is growing at an enormous rate," pointed out the
 show's producer, Lauren Weinstein of Vortex Technology.
 "Professor Neon's TV & Movie Mania has also broadcast via
 over-the-air stations, but it's apparent that the time has finally
 arrived when the global facilities of the Internet can bring this
 audio show to an even wider audience.  Nobody has ever used the
 Internet to transmit a show like this before," he added.

 "Professor Neon's TV & Movie Mania" is a unique show which
 features a look at a broad universe ranging from classic to
 current television, films, and videos, with a special emphasis on
 the unusual, odd, silly, strange, bizarre, cult, surreal, and
 weird.  The shows include reviews, interviews, and a wide range of
 special audio clips, trailers, and many other features.  

 The interview guest for the debut Internet version of the show is
 Robert Justman, a man whose work has greatly influenced classic
 television programs ranging from "The Outer Limits" (on which he
 was assistant director) to both the original "Star Trek" and "Star
 Trek: The Next Generation" (on which he was associate producer and
 co-producer, respectively).  Many of the most familiar aspects of
 these programs were the result of his ideas, and he speaks
 candidly with the show's enigmatic host, Professor Neon, about the
 production of these programs in this fascinating interview. 

 Professor Neon has featured programs focusing on topics ranging
 from "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (with guest "Vampira" who starred
 in the classic cult film), to Forrest J. Ackerman (publisher of
 "Famous Monsters" magazine), to shows focused on topics from "The
 Twilight Zone" to "The Three Stooges". 

 The half hour Internet version of the program is being distributed
 biweekly on the Internet via the Internet Multicasting Service in
 Washington D.C., on the "Internet Town Hall" channel, and is also
 available as a file for retrieval by any Internet user from the
 many Internet Multicasting / Internet Talk Radio archive sites
 around the world.  Users retrieving the audio files can then play
 them on virtually any workstation, PC, Mac, or other computer
 with even simple audio facilities.

 The most recent show, as well as other information regarding the
 program, can also be heard by calling Professor Neon's TV & Movie
 Mania Machine" on (310) 455-1212.

 The Internet version of the show is freely distributable via
 computer networks and BBS systems.  Use by over-the-air
 broadcasters requires the permission of Vortex Technology.  For
 more information regarding accessing the show via the Internet,
 please use the contact below.  Inquiries regarding other access
 and versions of the show for broadcast use are also invited.

 Notes to Internet folks:

 Information regarding the show, including current guest schedule, etc.
 is also available via FTP from site "ftp.vortex.com" (in the "tv-film-video"
 subdirectory) or via gopher from site "gopher.vortex.com" (under the
 "TV/Film/Video" menu item).

 For a list of Internet Multicasting Service / Internet Talk Radio archive
 sites to obtain (via FTP) the audio file for playback, send a message
 (content is not important) to:

         sites@radio.com

 The debut of the Internet version of the show will run via Internet
 Multicast from Interop on Thursday, May 5.  FTP to site "ftp.media.org"
 or "www.media.org" for schedule information.  The audio file of the show
 should become available in the archive sites for retrieval within a few
 days, though exact timing is variable.  The filenames will probably
 be "mania1.au" for the audio and "mania1.txt" for the accompanying
 descriptive text file, though the archive maintainers may change
 the names at some point to fit their overall naming system.  If you
 have trouble locating the files after a few days, please let us know.
 If you have any other questions regarding the program, feel free to
 email or call.

 In two weeks, our interview guest for the next show will be Joel Engel, the
 author of the definitive Rod Serling biography: "The Dreams and Nightmares
 of Life in the Twilight Zone," and of the newly released and highly
 controversial new book, "Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man
 Behind Star Trek."

 If you have any questions for Mr. Engel please email them to: 

    neon@vortex.com

 as soon as possible.  Thanks much!
