Words from Author: BBS Abusing is NOT hacking, It is lame and nowhere 
near as challenging as hacking. However there are many sysops that 
are assholes and need to be taught a good lesson, just make sure that 
you don't abuse any good boards...

 BBS Abusing
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                                                                           
 You all know how to abuse a BBS, But here's some pointers.....            
                                                                           
                                                                           
 I. Finding a BBS 2 Abuse                                                  
                                                                           
 1. Make sure it's in a place where you never call.                        
 2. Look for a place where the SysOp keeps leaving messages                
    on other boards talking about how his board is the best,               
    This usually means that it sucks, or the sysop is such                 
    an asshole that no one calls anymore, They should be a                 
    good hit.                                                              
 3. Try to pick a BBS that is running some Telegard Clone                  
    (More info on that later)                                              
 4. Pick one that has message and phile access on 1st call                 
 5. Pick a BBS that has a theme that you really hate such as..             
                                                                           
    * Kiddie Warez                                                         
    * Faggot Boardz                                                        
    * White Supremicist                                                    
                                                                           
 Those are the kinds of boards I wish didn't pollute the BBS Community,    
 Kiddie Warez boards are the easiest Boards in the World to take out,      
 After you've called them and gotten access to their "Warez" call up       
 The SPA (800-388-7478) and tell 'em that you got some lamers in the bag.  
 Give them the # of the lame BBS and the p-word....                        
 The fuckin' kids won't get in jail, But if society is lucky their mommies 
 and daddies might get mad at them, and not let them use the computer ever 
 again.                                                                    
                                                                           
 Faggot Boards are just as dispicable, Call me bigoted but if I was I would
 call the last lame kind of BBS, They might be harder to take out but hell 
 why not....                                                               
                                                                           
                                                                           
 II. First Logon                                                           
                                                                           
 1. Pick a name that sounds sorta' tough, but not anything like 'Shithead' 
 or 'fuck fuck' Those aren't original, Try.....                            
                                                                           
 You're Dead                                                               
 Abuse You                                                                 
                                                                           
 or Just pick a regular sounding name, Like Jason Smith. Leave a phake     
 phone number and address, The SysOps rarely ever Use that info, Except    
 to tell their lame friends they know tha stuff.                           
                                                                           
 2. Just look around and do things that you would do if you've never seen  
 the BBS before, Like Reading the G-philes and Looking throught the philez 
 lists... Don't do anything malicious, The SysOps will be very suspicious  
 if you upload anything small, They will probably guess It's a virus,      
 after a couple days call back and you should be validated. Now the        
 phun begins....                                                           
                                                                           
                                                                           
 III. Second Logon                                                         
                                                                           
 1. Once You've been Validated, You should be able to play the lame doors  
 that they have, Try hanging up in Them.                                   
                                                                           
 2. Send insulting, sicko messages in echo mail(like RelayNet              
 and Fido-fuck-net) That way they will be all over the world and the BBS   
 will get a bad reputation with the Holier-Than-Thou Lamers who have those 
 nets. The SysOp will be mad, and send you a message about it or he'll     
 lock your ass out, So Goes..                                              
                                                                           
 IV. Third Logon                                                           
                                                                           
 1. Log on next with a name very similar to the SysOps like add an E to the 
 end of their last name or an extra L in some names, Or The Sysop will do  
 fine.....                                                                 
                                                                           
 2. Post messages to new users saying things like 'Fuck Off, If you're that
 lame then you don't belong on my BBS!!!!!!!!!!'. Then The SysOp will be   
 completely pissed, and Lock you out again... This is Phun, Huh?           
                                                                           
 V. Fourth Logon                                                           
                                                                           
 1. Compile a virus... If you don't know how to get them.. Try to download 
 CRPTLET*.ZIP, The Crypt Newsletter has alot of viruses uncompiled in it.. 
 Once you've got one type debug < *.scr Whatever the name of the scr phile 
 Then find a data phile that takes up about 500k put the COM Virus in the  
 that the data phile is in, edit an NFO file of the pirate group of your   
 choice (iNC I usually use because they're a huge group) Bragging about    
 that group and make up a couple of BBS's as Dist. Sites.......            
 Now that you have the NFO phile, Rename the DAT phile to something like   
 GOBLIINS.DAT and the com to GOBLIINS.COM.... I used Gobliins as an example
 but you can use any popular comercial game you want.. Now make a batch fil
 from the DOS prompt like this......                                       
                                                                           
 Copy Con PKUNZIP.BAT                                                      
 command                                                                   
 ^Z (CTRL-Z)                                                               
                                                                           
 Zip it up and upload, If it's a popular game many lamers will download    
 it, and get the virus!!!!                                                 
                                                                           
 2. Upload Legitimate Commercil Software under many real sounding names,   
 Call the SPA Again(I gave the # in the begining of this section)          
                                                                           
 3. (TelegardRenegadeetc.. BBS Software only)                            
    Upload your PKUNZIP.BAT Phile and check to see if there is an archive  
    menu. Then try to unzip any ZIP file, If the circumstances were right  
    You should be in the boards........ DOS!!!!!!.. If I need to tell you  
    what to do in there, You shouldn't be reading this.                    
                                                                           
                                                                           
 If the SysOp hasn't brought down the BBS then, There's no hope, But hey   
 he couldn't have enjoyed all that!
