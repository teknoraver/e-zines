 Hello All, well as you have probably not noticed, we have not been making                      
 any files lately. Well this is for several reason. 1) The people in the
 group have not gotten off their butts and written files. 2) There is a new
 group that has been started called MoT (Not RoT!) who basically have alot 
 of talent. I and the remaining members of /´FTERSHOCK INC. have joined them 
 and will be more active there. I wrote a couple of tfiles that I have saved 
 for them(Yes they're better than this shit). For a little sample download
 MOTAD.001 from your friendly neighborhood BBS.. See ya' in an upcoming issue
 of MoT! Although there may still be some /´FTERSHOCK files left... Just look
 around for

 This is a couple files of limited usefulness that I got from a VAX machine
 that I hacked into. Try to get in by using one of these default accounts, it 
 does have some things to do once you're inside.

The UACN VAX Network consists of a number of Digital Equipment Corporation
VAX minicomputers interconnected by means of DECnet, Digital's networking
product.  The network consists of three UACN-owned VAX computer clusters,
named ACAD1 (located in Juneau), ACAD2 (in Anchorage), and ACAD3 (in
Fairbanks).  You may obtain a username and use any of these three computers
by simply asking at your local UACN office.

Incidentally, there are VAXen owned by other University departments that
are connected to the network, so don't be surprised if you see references
to VAXen other than ACAD1, ACAD2, and ACAD3.

The UACN VAXen offer a command called "EXPLAIN" which will give you information
about the computer network and its software.  Some introductory information is
given in EXPLAIN INTRO.  A menu of this introductory material will follow.

Your terminal keyboard looks a lot like a typewriter keyboard, but there are
some important differences.  VAX uses some of the additional features and some
other tricks to make typing a lot easier.  It may also save you some trouble
when you are using VAX software.

_C_o_n_t_r_o_l _K_e_y_s

VAX uses control characters to perform various special jobs.  If you look on
your terminal's keyboard, you'll find a key marked "CTRL" (or a similar
abbreviation) in the lower left corner.  This key works like the SHIFT key:
you hold down the CTRL key and press another key to get a control character.
For example, the character called "control U" (abbreviated CTRL/U or ^U) is
produced by holding down the CTRL key and pressing the U key.  The most common
control characters and other special characters are summarized below.

_C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r       _R_e_s_u_l_t
DELETE          Erases the last character that you typed.  (On some terminals,

                this key is marked "RUBOUT").  This is NOT the same as
                BACKSPACE or the left arrow key.
TAB             Moves the cursor to start of next column (default columns are
                8 characters wide).  Same as ^I.
^C              Stops the current activity; depending on the program, you may
                remain in the program or be returned to the "$" prompt.
^Y              Stops everything; returns you to the "$" prompt.
^U              Cancels the line that you are typing and allows you to retype
                it.
^Z              Marks the end of input; used to tell programs that you are
                finished entering data.
^S              Freezes the display (gives you time to read the display).
^Q              Unfreezes the display; resumes output.
NO SCROLL       Alternately sends ^S and ^Q to make life a little simpler.

_T_h_e _O_t_h_e_r _K_e_y_s

Most terminals have keys with arrows on them (up, down, left, and right).
These are called "cursor keys" because they can be used to move the cursor
around on the screen.  They can be used to patch up the commands that you

Press RETURN to continue...
type (see EXPLAIN LINEEDIT).  They are also used for moving around
within the screen editors (see EXPLAIN EDITORS).

The last major feature is the "keypad", the group of numeric keys and
function keys (PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4) at the right side of most keyboards.
Most of the time, you can use the numeric keys to quickly type in numbers.
Within the screen editors, all keypad keys perform special functions.  You
can also use the DEFINE command to "program" these keys to simplify your
work (see EXPLAIN DEFINE).

_T_y_p_e _A_h_e_a_d

The "type ahead" feature on VAX allows you to keep typing while VAX is busy
processing your previous commands.  VAX will store away everything that you
are typing in, and use it when the time comes.  VAX has a limited amount of
storage, though - if it starts beeping every time you type a character, it is
telling you to give it a chance to catch up.  As soon as it digests some of
what you have typed, you can continue typing ahead.

_P_o_s_s_i_b_l_e _P_r_o_b_l_e_m_s

Press RETURN to continue...
There are a number of simple-to-fix problems that you will probably run into
eventually.  Here are some of them and their solutions:

NOTHING SHOWS UP ON THE TERMINAL WHILE I TYPE.  Most often this is caused by
pressing the ^S or NO SCROLL keys accidentally.  On CIT-101e terminals, the
ONLINE light flashes if this is the case.  You can correct it by typing ^Q or
pressing the NO SCROLL key again.
On occasion, lack of response is due to a pause or failure in the network.
If you cannot get a response within a couple of minutes, check with the
nearest UACN consultant for assistance.

I ACCIDENTALLY TYPED ^C OR ^Y AND KILLED WHAT I WAS DOING.  Don't panic...
you can get back to what you were doing by typing "CONTINUE" after the
"$" prompt:

        $ continue

However, this only works if you do it right after the accident.  If you do
some other work before using CONTINUE, you may not be able to continue.

In order to login to any of the UACN computers, you must have a
username and a password.  The username (or userid - user identification)
identifies you to the computer.  The username is public information,
and you can tell anyone what your username is.

On the other hand, your password is top secret - only you and the computer
should know what it is.  Don't tell anyone what your password is, and make
sure that nobody watches as you type it in.  This is especially important
if you have personal or hard-to-replace data stored in your files.  The
only exception to this secrecy is if one of the UACN consultants needs to
know your password in order to help you with a problem.  As soon as the
problem is fixed, you should change your password.  Even if you don't let
anyone know your password, you should change your password regularly, once
a month or so.  You can change your password with the SET PASSWORD command
like this:

        $ set password

Press RETURN to continue...
        Old password:
        New password:
        Verification:

(For verification, type in the new password again.)

_T_h_e _C_a_s_e _o_f _t_h_e _F_o_r_g_o_t_t_e_n _P_a_s_s_w_o_r_d

When you apply for a username, you give an Account Identification number
(AID) which is, in most cases, your social security number.  This number
is your first password.

If you forget what your password is at some point, you should drop by the
local UACN office and tell the consultant.  You may be required to show
some identification to prove that you are the owner of the username.
The consultant will then reset your password to your AID, just as it was
originally.  _N_o_b_o_d_y, including consultants, can look up your password
on the computer and find out what it is.

_M_u_l_t_i_p_l_e _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s_, _M_u_l_t_i_p_l_e _U_s_e_r_n_a_m_e_s

Just because you have a username on one of the UACN computers doesn't
mean that you can login to any of the other computers.  However, you
may discover that the software that you need to use is on one of the
other computers, but not on yours.

The solution is simple: just go to your local UACN office and request
a username on the other computer or computers.  If you have a username,
you shouldn't have any trouble getting a username on one of the other
VAX computers.  All you have to do is ask.

Your username will be the same on all VAX computers; if you are FTLSK3
on ACAD3, you will be FTLSK3 on ACAD1 and ACAD2 as well.

_W_h_o_'_s _W_h_o _o_n _V_A_X

You will often want to know what somebody's username is.  If you know the
person's last name, you can find the username with the WHO command:

        $ who smith

Press RETURN to continue...
This command will find all usernames belonging to people with "smith" in
their names, such as "Smith, John Q", "Smithson, Paul C", and so on.
You can restrict the search if you know the person's first name:

        $ who mary smith

You can also find out who belongs to a username.  Just put the username
in place of the person's name, such as:

        $ who sxpl
