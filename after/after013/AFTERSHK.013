>>> Body Count (5:18)

You know sometimes I sit at home, you know,
and I watch TV and wonder what it would be like
to live some place like the Cosby Show, 
Ozzie and Harriet, you know, where 
the cops came and got your cat outta the tree
and all your friends died of old age.
But you see, I live in South Central and unfourtunately...
SHIT AIN'T LIKE THAT! IT'S REAL FUCKED UP!

Goddamn what a brotha gotta do
to get a message through 
to the red, white and blue?
What I gotta die 
before you realize
I was a brotha with open eyes?
The world's insane
while you drink champagne
and I'm livin' in black rain.
You try to ban the A.K.,
I've got ten of 'em stashed
with a case of hand grenades

Tell us what to do...Fuck you!
Tell us what to do...Fuck you!
Tell us what to do...Fuck you!
Tell us what to do...Fuck you!

You know what you'd do 
if a kid got killed on the way to school
or a cop shot your kid in the backyard.
Shit would hit the fan muthafucka
and it would hit real hard.
I hear it every night, another gun fight,
the tension mounts,
on with the Body Count.

Yo, Beatmaster "V", take these muthafuckas 
to Suth Central.

(Drum Solo)

I hear it every night,
another gun fight,
the tension mounts,
on with the Body Count.

Last weekend thirty-seven kids killed in gang warfare,
in my backyard.

(Guitar Solo)

Yo, Ernic C. take these muthafuckas home.

(Guitar Solo)

Yeah, we in the house, Body Count fools, 1991 muthafuckas.

I hear it every night,
another gun fight,
the tension mounts,
on with the Body Count.

Goddamn what a brotha gotta do
to get a message through
to the red, white and you?
What I gotta die before you realize
I was a nigga with open eyes?
The world's insane
while you drink champagne
and I'm livin' in black rain,
don't you hear the gun 
you stupid,dick suckin',bum politicians.

Tell us what to do...Fuck you!
Tell us what to do...Fuck you!
The tension mounts...

>>> Bowels of the Devil (3:43)

Out one night,yo, just chillin' out with my crew
We were actin' wild
'cause we didn't have nothin' else better to do.
Got a nine in my waist 
stay out my fuckin' face.
You fuck with me
right here'll be your resting place.
Some ol' sucka,yo,tried to put a move on me
I shot him in the face,
murder, in the first degree.
Now I'm sweatin', regrettin',
that's not for me
they got me locked in the fuckin' penitentiary.

Bowels of the devil,
let me tell you what the muthafucka eats,
it's stomach's filled with lost souls
guts made out of steel and concrete.
Bowel's of the devil,
listen close,'cause I've been there before
and you don't wanna die there,
they call it goin' out the back door,
the back door,the back door, the back door.

Walked into the club all the ho's gave me the sex look
they like a nigga like me, 'cause I'm a known crook,
and my posse's down, we don't mess around,
you fuck with us,
you'll be six feet underground.
That night they got me locked in a row called death
the governor, that muthafucka wants my last breath.
That's right, homeboy wanted to pull a switch on me
up here in this fuckin' penitentary.

Bowels of the devil,
let me tell you what this sucka eats,
it's stomach's filled with my homeboys
guts made out of steel and concrete.
Bowels of the devil,
listen close, 'cause I've been there before
and you don't wanna die there,
they call it goin' out the back door,
the back door, the back door, the back door, Yeah!

(Guitar solo)

Bowels of the devil,
let me tell you what the muthafucka eats,
it's stomach's filled with my homeboys
guts made out of steel and concrete.
Bowels of the devil,
listen close,'cause I been there before
and you don't wanna die there,
they call it goin' out the back door.
The bowels of the devil, 
let me tell you what this sucka eats,
it's stomach's filled with lost souls,
guts made out of steel and concrete.
Bowels of the devil,
listen close 'cause I've been there before
and you don't wanna die there,
they call it goin' out the back door,
the back door, the back door, the back door.

>>> KKK Bitch (2:53)

Aw yeah, what's up out there? BC's in the house. Right
about now, I wanna tell you a little love story, you know
what I'm sayin', this is a Body Count love story check
out the lyrics, you know. I'm'a tell you 'bout what happened
when we went down South last year on tour.

Out on tour,yo,I been all around the world
went to Georgia, met this fine-assed white girl,
blonde hair,blue eyes, big tits and thighs,
the kinda girl that would knock out most guys.
She got wild in the backstage bathroom,
sucked my dick like a muthafuckin' vacuum,
said "I love you, but my daddy don't play,
he's the fuckin' grand wizard of the KKK."

I I I love my KKK bitch,love it when she sucks me though,
I I I love my KKK bitch,love it when she fucks me though,
I I I love my KKK bitch,she loves it when I treat her bad,
I I I love my KKK bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad.

You know what I'm sayin'. So we was down south fallin' in
love, you know, D-Roc had this nazi gril, my man
Mooseman had a skinhead, I fell in love with Tipper Gore's
two twelve year old neices. It was wild, you know what I'm 
sayin', it got even worse, you know.

So one night they took us to a meetin'
white sheets, whit hoods, no room for seatin'
there were skinheads,nazis and crazys,
talkin' 'biut black people pushin' up daisies.
They hated Blacks,Jews,Puerto Ricans,
Mexicans,Chinese, even the Indians.
We had our hoods on,
we were slick
she pushed her butt up hard against my dick.
Ther her daddy jumped on stage
talkin''bout killin' in a goddamn rage.
I got mad, my dick got hard
entered in her ass
she said,"Oh my God!"

(Chorus)

So what we really tryin' to say is Body Count loves
everybody. We love Mexican girls,Black girls,Oriental girls
it really don't matter. If you from Mars, and you got a pussy,
we will fuck you. You know, that's all we sayin' word.

So every year when Body Count comes around
we throw an orgy in every little Southern town.
KKK's,Skinheads, and Nazi
girls break their necks
to get to the party.
It ain't like their men can't nut,
their dick's too little 
and they just can't fuck.
So we get buck wild with the white freaks
we show them how to really work the white sheets.
I know her daddy'll really be after me,
when his grandson's named little Ice-T.

(Chorus)

>>> Voodoo (5:00)

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Way down in New Orleans, yeah.
I met this old lady,
she said she'd teach me 'bout Voodoo
she said she knew about Voodoo
she said she'd teach me 'bout Voodoo
she said she knew about Voodoo.

She had an old doll,
she had a long shing needle
she held the doll in the air
it looked kinda like me
she took the needle,
stuck it in its eye!

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
My eye, bitch!

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

Now I'm still in the room with this crazy bitch,
and she still had the doll.
She said I'll teach you 'bout Voodoo
you wanna learn about Voodoo
She said I'll teach you 'bout Voodoo.

She held the doll in her hand
she had some long shiny scissors,
she said some magic words
and doll looked more and more like me
she held the doll in the air
she took the scissors,
cut off all it's fingers!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
My fingers, bitch!

So if you're ever down in New Orleans, yeah.
You might meet an old lady
she might have a doll
it might look like you.
Don't ask about the Voodoo
stay away from the Voodoo
leave alone the Voodoo
muthafuck the Voodoo.

>>> The Winner Loses (6:31)

My friend's addicted to cocaine
smokes day and night
drives mom and pop insane.
Living his life in the dark light
every dollar he gets goes into the pipe.

He want's to borrow some money from me
do you think I'm blind
don't know the score
can't see?

You wanna get high as the sky
You're kissing your life goodbye
You think it's a game that you play 
But the winners lose it all someday.

Ya don't know who you are
are you losin' your mind?
Things get a little tight he commited a crime.
Give me your money or give me your life!
You betta open your pockets because ya,
ya don't live twice.

You wanna get high as the sky 
You're kissing your life goodbye
You think it's a game that you play
But the winners lose it all someday.

He took the money to the dope man 
and he said he had the best
next thing ya knew, cardiac arrest!
It was a rollercoaster he couldn't get off
next thing I knew my friends life was lost. Nooooooooo.

You wanna get high as the sky
You're kissing your life goodbye
You think it's a game that you play
But the winners lose it all someday.

>>> There Goes the Neighborhood (5:50)

There goes the neighborhood.

Who let 'em in the club?
Did you make 'em pay?

I said, "It wasn't me baby,

evil dick!"

(Chorus)

>>> Momma's Gotta Die Tonight (6:11)

No, no, no, Mommaaaaa...

All my life I loved this girl so much
All my live I loved her simple touch
She cared for me and put me on this earth
Oh the pain of just a simple birth
But I now I find that dhe has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned, twisted and destroyed my mind
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight

Momma, momma, I always loved my momma,
I always loved my momma.
I loved the way she hold me,
I love the way she talked to me
She used to teach me a lot of things,
she taught me good things, she taught me bad things.
"Don't trust white people, don't trust white people.
They're no good, they're no good, they're no good.
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off.
Don't trust 'em, don't trust 'em."
I said, "Why momma?" She said, "I told you
don't trust 'em they're no good."
I said, "Momma, I thought we were all the
same momma, why momma?" She said,
"Don't ask me any questions.
Don't you challenge your mutha."  Momma.

So one day I found I fell in love
and I brought my girlfriend home
and I introduced her to my mutha and
she smacked me, was a white girl and
I said "Why momma?  Why momma?
What did I do wrong?"
You know, I found out my mutha was an evil woman.
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans,
Indians, Orientals, momma was no good.
I learned to hate my mutha, hate my mutha.
So I got some lighter fluid, from the corner store
and I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire!
Ha, ha, ha.
Burn momma, burn momma, burn momma,
burn bitch burn, burn, burrrrrrn
Ha, ha, ha.  Burn you racist bitch!
Ha, ha, ha.
But she wasn't quite dead.  She jumped up from the bed
and I grabbed my Louisville Slugger that she had bought
me for my twelfth birthday and I came up behind her and
I hit her, I hit her, I hit her twice.  Ha, ha, ha.
Now she was out.
I went into the kithcen
and I got that handy carving knife that we only use on special occasions
like bullshit Thanksgiving, and I took her and I laid her ol' fucked up
corpse on the floor and I cut her in little pieces.  Cut off her arms,
her feet, her neck, and I put her in to litle green Hefty bags and I
put them into my car and I said, "Momma, we're goin' on a vacation, a
permanent vacation bitch."

I took some of her around the world to Arizona, New York, Chicago,
Miami, Oakland.  Ha, ha, ha, yo, you wanna go to Connecticut, bitch.
Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.  Who's laughin' now momma, who's laughin' now
bitch.

Who's laughin now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

So if you got a mutha or a grandmutha or a father who wants to carry on 
the same racist bullshit that's fucked this world up from day one, you 
can either look 'em in the face and tell 'em to suck your dick or do 
like Body Count does.

All my life I loved this girl so much
All my live I loved her simple touch
She cared for me and put me on this earth
Oh the pain of just a simple birth
But I now I find that dhe has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned, twisted and destroyed my mind
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race
That's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight
There's only one way I can make it right
Momma's gotta die tonight

>>> Cop Killer (4:09) 

I got my black shirt on
I got my black gloves on
I got my ski mask on
This shit's been too long
I got my twelve gauge sawed off
I got my headlights turned off
I'm 'bout to bust some shots off
