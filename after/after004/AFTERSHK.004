All right every one it's another ASI issue. This one is about absolutely 
nothing at all. well... Anyways I am watching TV (Pretty pathetic in itself)
and they will not shut up about the damn Waco thang.. Enough! What those
people don't think about is that more people die in violence in this coutry
every day but nooooooo it's just so awful that those stupid religios freaks
killed themselves! After all, its not their fault they can't think for 
themselves. Why not worry about all the problems in the 'hood or elsewhere.
Many more people get killed than 84 every day. 

Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh.............


Fuck you, fuck clinton, fuck hillary, fuck al gore, fuck bob dole, fuck that
attorney general bitch, fuck everyone!!!!

ANSi D00DZ Should be erased, WaReZ d00dz should be cracked and YOU should
be gunned down!!



                      
      AND NOW ITS ABOUT TIME FOR LYRIX!!!! THAT'S RIGHT KiDDiES!!!        
      

Are you ready......
