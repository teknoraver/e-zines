     Well, a new year will soon be upon us as I am writing this.  So, I guess 
it's time for a `New Years Resolution.'  I resolve to become more hardcore 
this year and provide you with more in-depth info than in 1992.

     1993 will probably be a great year of change for Phirst Amendment.  We 
will continue to bring you things you need to know as well as the things you 
want to know.  We are here for you, the reader, as your voice and `soapbox.'  
We will continue to accept your views on all subjects.  If there's something 
you want, then tell us.  Just don't tune us out because we don't cover 
something you like.  We realize that everyone has different views, and we 
respect them.  In fact, that is just what we are trying to inspire - 
Independent Thought.

     We are setting up a distribution network.  It is not very massive at this 
time.  We have sites in St. Louis, Connecticut, Denver, Kentucky, Birmingham, 
AL, Mississippi, and Puerto Rico!  EFF is carrying it, as are several other 
FTP servers, such as the University of Michigan, University of Washington, 
etc.

     I hope you enjoy this issue as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you.  
Pass the word around; we can only get better with your support.

                                        -Anesthesia-


-------------------------------------DC------------------------------------

	Once again, a terrific response from people.  Not so many suggestions 
this time.  Are we getting it right for a change?  A lot of "Hey, keep up the 
good work!"s.  That makes me feel good about doing this.  I realize that not 
everyone, everywhere has a place in their life for a publication like this.  
If they did, we wouldn't need one.  This is the kind of publication that gives 
form to ideas for school reports and speeches.  It's the kind that molds 
revolutions...  If you, as a student, (getting a lot of students as readers!) 
feel the desire to utilize the information presented in ANY copy of Phirst 
Amendment in a report or presentation, PLEASE do so.  That would be most 
excellent.  We need to let others know that we ARE thinking.  And maybe, just 
maybe, one or two of those `old farts' will come around.  They may remember 
what they stood up against in the 60s that they may be supporting now... you 
could wake them up!

     Other things you can do to make a change:  Write editorials to your local 
paper about things that are going on right now.  They have published several 
of mine over the years.  It might just stimulate others with similar views.  
Collect Mass-Petitions. Write to your Congressman, Senator, Representative, 
Mayor and every other elected official that you can find that has some 
political pull.

     Let THEM know that we aren't going to be led around like sheep with 
blinders on, not knowing what's going on around us, only knowing that we are 
in line...  Waiting for slaughter?  That's what the last page, or centerfold 
(for you land subscribers), is for.  It is a copy of the First Amendment, in 
case the official you are petitioning has forgotten what it was, with space 
for you to address your grievance with the current situation - whatever it is!  
You HAVE that right, it's guaranteed by law...  Read the opening again...  
That's what it says and means!

     This issue pretty much made itself.  Lots of info out there on this 
topic.  Nobody seems very comfortable with the SSA now or in its future.  So 
we have a sampling of a few authors' views on this matter.  A little 
redundancy, but I take that to mean that the threat is VERY real and well 
known.  Let your elected representatives KNOW how you feel about them and this 
issue.  Send them a copy of Phirst Amendment.  Let them know that hundreds of 
thousands of registered voters receive this publication, all across the 
country and around the globe.  Maybe then, they'll start to do what's best for 
everyone...

     I'd like to introduce Pink Freud (601)- a recent addition to our staff, 
flown in from Mississippi.  He has helped a LOT by doing background research 
on people, flying around doing interviews, and editing articles, insuring 
their political correctness.  He was the leader of Insanity, Incorporated- a A 
land-based Underground faction which produced 235 DIFFERENT informational 
pamphlets.  Expect to hear some GREAT things from him.

     As we incorporate smaller groups into one large group, we get closer and 
closer to operating the Underground as a unified organization.  This is our 
ultimate goal.  I have no desire to be THE leader of the Underground- it 
probably wouldn't work well that way.  We DO need a unified group to institute 
the changes that are necessary for survival.

     I've put a new column in, actually two: Virus World, and Through the 
LoopHole.  Virus World is in due to the HUGE response from the BBS 
Connection's interview with Chuck Price.  Loophole is due to my desire to put 
some more `Inside' information in the hands of those that can most (ab)use it 
- our constituency...  After all this is a church publication.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Chemical of the Month /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
                               by Anesthesia 


Acetic Acid
(C2 H4 O2)

AKA:  Methane carboxylic acid, vinegar acid, ethanoic acid

Description:
      Clear, colorless liquid;  pungent odor.

Uses: Manufacture of cellulose acetate, plastics, dyes, insecticides,
      pharmaceuticals; textile printing

Hazards:
      Moderately toxic; can damage skin.
      Do NOT expose to heat or flame.
      Will explode on contact with:

           Sulfuric Acid
           Nitric Acid

[Okay, okay...  You've all been asking what kind of experiments you can do 
with the knowledge presented in the Chemical of the Month column.  ..]

Match Head Bomb

     This is a well known, but still extremely useful explosive device.  In 
its simplest form, it makes a nice detonator for other explosives.  Try it and 
I'm sure you'll find thousands of uses for this fun project.

     1> Using scotch tape, make a tube out of a paper grocery bag about 2" 
long by 1" diameter.  Cut a 1" circle of paper and tape it to one end.

     2> Pick or scrape the combustible chemicals off the tip of about a 
thousand stick matches. [Blue Tips (brand) are best.] Add a small amount of 
water to the mixture and crush them in a glass ashtray.  [Or invest the $5 in 
a mortar and pestle from Walgreen's.]

     3> Pack the tube to about 3/4" from the top.

     4> Take about 1/4" wooden dowel and insert it into the center of the 
tube.  Then pack the explosive charge around this all the way to the top.  
When it starts to harden, carefully remove the dowel so that you have a hole 
1/4" wide by 1-1/4" long in the center.  This allows the center to dry as well 
as give you room to install a detonator.

     5> After a few days, peel off the scotch tape and gently remove as much 
of the paper bag as you can.  Don't worry if some of it sticks to the charge.  
Set it in a warm, dry area and let it dry completely.

     This is a relatively safe device to make and use.  I suggest you can see 
the effect.

     If you desire a larger explosive, you may add gunpowder or any other heat 
or spark activated explosive.  Just be sure to research any substitutions, 
carefully research your ingredients don't react violently with one another.


[The first time I read this, I got goosebumps.  I haven't heard the song, but 
I have a new-found respect for Guns and Roses due to the quality of the lyric 
that follows.  It is so appropriate and excellent, that I feel I cannot really 
do it the justice it deserves.]

Don't Damn Me

Don't damn me - when I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden, when I'm holding it inside; 
'Cause I've been where I've been, and I've seen what I've seen.
I put my pen to the paper, 'cause it's all part of me:

Be it a song or a casual conversation to hold
My tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words once heard: they can place you in a faction.
My words may disturb, but at least there's a reaction.

Sometimes I wanna kill     - Sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy  - Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even - Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give     - Sometimes I never give a fuck

It only happens for a while, I hope you understand:
I never wanted this to happen, didn't want to be man.
So I hid inside my world, I took what I could find.
I cried when I was lonely, I fell down when I was blind.

Don't damn me - when I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden, when I'm holding it inside; 
'Cause I've been where I've been, and I've seen what I've seen.
I put my pen to the paper, 'cause it's all part of me:

How can I ever satisfy you?  And how can I ever make you see
that deep inside we're all somebody, And it don't matter who you wanna be.
But now I gotta smile, I hope you comprehend
'Cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped inside your world; I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime.

But look at what I've done, to the innocent and young
Whoa- listen to who's talking - 'cause we're not the only ones.
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
sad, it tears into our conscious thoughts -
You tell me who's to blame!

I know you don't wanna hear me crying; and I don't wanna hear me deny
that your satisfaction lies in your illusions
but your illusions are delusions - and not mine.
We take for granted we know the whole story, we judge a book by its cover,
and read what we want - between selected lines.

Don't hail me - and don't idolize the ink;
or I've failed in my intentions.
Can you find the missing link?
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended:
I've said what I meant and I've never pretended
as so many others do - intending just to please
If I damned YOUR point of view, could YOU turn the other cheek!?

Don't damn me - when I speak a piece of my mind
'Cause silence isn't golden, when I'm holding it inside; 
'Cause I've been where I've been, and I've seen what I've seen.
I put my pen to the paper, 'cause it's all part of me:
Don't damn me, I said don't damn me.
I said don't hail me.  Don't damn me.

[What the hell is this??  A column by David Lightman?  Yes.  I will now give 
my obligatory preface as to the purpose of this column and why I deem it 
necessary.]

     One of my fortes, as you may have determined from 1a.1, is money: its 
manipulation, multiplication, and mastication.  The ability to do heretofore 
unheard of things with money, is the ability to read between the lines: to 
make the rules do things FOR you, instead of TO you.  I have been asked to 
give more information on money (making, saving, utilizing) by those who are 
aware of the amount of study I've put into it.  I can help those people as 
well as others by exposing Loopholes!

     Loopholes are creative interpretations, or grey-areas, of rules that can 
make them benefit the average Joe.  I have used MANY of the loopholes around 
me to do quite well for myself.  Those who have seen my apartment can testify 
to that.

     I'm not attempting to be the braggard, I merely want you to see that I 
USE these things (except the illegal ones... ;>  ) and they WORK.  It's not a 
textbook examination of a rule and how it COULD be manipulated.  It's hard, 
cold facts backed by a case-history (my life) of optimum  performance. 

     In all of these loopholes, a common denominator appears:  self-control.  
If you cannot control yourself, it doesn't matter how good the plan is... You 
can mess up a trip to the mall if you cannot control the most important thing 
TO control - YOURSELF!  It doesn't matter if it's savings, investments, social 
engineering, dieting, doing homework, whatever...  you must control your 
senses, and follow the directions to the letter.  If you let yourself get 
emotional about something that is happening, and you know what the next step 
is... but cannot wait for the proper time...  the results can be disastrous.

     I will probably make many allusions to this need for control with each 
loophole I identify.  There will, of course, be petty loopholes, that a three-
year-old can handle quite easily.  These are not as subject to the need for 
self-discipline.

     Enough Zen and the Art of Bamboozling, let's get on with this.


Free Mail
!!!! !!!!

     Ever notice that the mail rates change very often and at, almost, 
exponential rates?   Well, you can worsen the situation for these poor, 
underpaid civil service workers, by knowing how the postal system works.

     There are two main things to remember about how insufficient postage is 
handled:

     If there is NO postage, the letter will be 'returned' to the sender's 
address in the upper left-hand side of the envelope.

     If there is SOME (greater than zero cents) postage, but not enough to 
totally cover the cost of the mailing, it will be delivered in a state known 
as 'Postage Due.'  The addressee must pay the remaining amount of postage to 
receive the letter/package.  The addressee has the option to refuse the posted 
item, sending it back to the return addressee (as in above.)

     The mail service cannot determine where mail has been sent from by any 
means other than the return address.  [They can open it to determine the 
address of the sender, if there is no return address]  I'm sure you can see 
what I am getting at by now...

     If you're trying to impress someone, mailing a letter to them this way is 
NOT the way to do it...  but, if you need to send a disk to a buddy, or send a 
book; something big, bulky, etc...  This is an excellent means by which to 
'transfer' this object back to the return address on the parcel.

     Say you are on the road, you need to send some disks home, right?  You 
address the letter to your friend, so that he can get these disks.  But DAMN, 
you left off the postage.  These disks will mosey on back to your home 
address, and isn't it convenient that you needed to send those disks there 
anyway?  And you gave your ACTUAL home address!  What's further from fraud 
than using your own address as the return address?  [putting postage on it  -
Storm] [but ASIDE from that choice??- Daiv]

     Then again, if you are angry with someone, but promised to send them 
something... put a one cent stamp on it.  It'll go all the way to their door.  
They can even touch the package...  but before they can have it, they have to 
pay the remaining postage.  Or if you want to ruin the public image of some 
company, get some envelopes of theirs.  Send letters of nonsense or empty 
envelopes to big companies with postage due.  Put One Cent stamps on there, 
and they'll make it ALL the way to the company - and piss them off.


Free VERY Unlisted Phone

     First of all, this is NOT teaching you how to get a free phone line.  
That's a totally different concept.  You are not yet ready, grasshoppa...
When you can grab the pebble from my hand... (nevermind)

     Let's say, for some reason, you want your phone to be unlisted in your 
local telephone book.  Your local carrier company will want to charge you to 
NOT put your number in the book.  This is ridiculous, as I am sure you are 
aware.

      There are two ways to scam this one:

     The easiest one, is to NOT have your number listed during the ONE month 
that the phone books are sent to the printers.  For instance, In St. Louis, 
all numbers in existence by Mid-October are in the phone book which comes out 
in February.  Call the operator in your city to determine what month is the 
cut-off around you.   For that month ONLY, pay to have your number unlisted.  
After you have had your number unlisted for ONE month, try the following 
script.  

Hint: Be in Wallace Cleaver emulation mode with this call, unless you get a 
younger operator, with whom, a Doogie Howser is more appropriate.  You want 
them to think you are quite respectable and a little socially alienated.  This 
should prevent them from asking you too many questions or accusing you of 
something.

[Note: In some places, you have to call a 'business office' - the same script 
will work.]

Operator: Operator Assistance, may I help you?
You: Yes, thanks, I'd like to have my number listed in the phone book.
O: Well, the current one is already being printed, but you'll be in the
   upcoming year's phone book.
U: Gosh Darndit, That bothers me.
O: There's really nothing we can do about it, Sir.  The information is
   already at the printers and the books are almost done now [Which they
   really aren't] so it's impossible to get your name into it.
U: Oh, Okay, I understand.  Well, my number will still be available for
   Directory Assistance, right.   [GIVE IN!!  Don't push this one.]
O: Sure.
U: Oh, All right - go ahead and put me in the next one, then.

   [You then provide phone number, address, and your name.]

O: We'll get that fixed right away.
U: Thanks - Have a good day.
O: Thanks for using Bell South [Like you have a choice!]

     That will keep your number out of the Phone book, Haines Criss-Cross 
directory, and out of a lot of telemarketers hands.  Your number (except for 
that ONE month) will still be accessible by 1-411, directory assistance.

     The ballsier way is a little more difficult without discipline.  You have 
the right to have your phone listed under whatever name you want,  regardless 
of who is living there.  Try this:

U: I'd like to change the name under which my phone is listed.
O: Okay, what's your phone number?
   [Exchange billing information]
O: What name would you like that listed under?
U: [For example: ] Harry Phueksteich

   [This is where it can sometimes get interesting...]

Situation #1 (The nosy bitch!)
O: We can't put this number under someone else's name.  That just isn't
   right.  [Most operators aren't aware of this right]
U: I just got a new roommate, and I want to put it in his name.
O: Why HIS name?  You're paying the bill right?
U: I make calls, but I never get any... He has more friends than I do.  I
   don't really need it listed in my name.
O: We can add an additional listing for you so it's in both names...
U: How much does that cost?  [Everything costs with the phone company!]
O: Only three dollars a month...
U: Thirty-six dollars a year, so my non-existant friends can find my number
   more easily?  It's not worth it...  Just put it in his name.

Situation #2 (The nice lady)
O: He must get a lot of flak with that name...
U: Why do you say that?  [Play dumb!]
O: Oh, never mind

Situation #3 (Big Brother)
O: We like to get information on the people who are serviced by a phone
   number.  Do you know where he works, or his SSN, etc...
Y: No, I'd have to get him to send you a letter or get back to you.
O: Okay, have Mr. Pheuksteich do that as soon as he can.

     I've never understood that last one, If the bill is coming to you, then 
you are responsible.  What does it matter WHO the hell lives with you?  They 
don't need this information.  They just WANT it.  Tough.  Don't get cocky with 
them about it, they can just deny your request and hang up.  Another good 
thing to do is, when they answer, say "Hello XXXXXX"  where XXXXXX is Operator 
number Whatever or Ms. Whoever.  This way, they KNOW you know who they are.  
If they are rude, just report them to their supervisor.

     In about a week, go to a pay phone.  Call Directory Assistance (1-411) 
[It's free at pay phones] and ask for Harry Pheucksteich's (or whatever name 
you gave) phone number on so-and-so street.  That will serve two purposes:  
Amusement and Confirmation.

     I've used this successfully (since this is particularly legal) with the 
names: Dan Fielding,  Oliver Wendell Jones,  David Lightman,  Bob Zambezie, 
and Larry "Bud" Melman.  They let you get away with pretty much anything.  And 
you can change it whenever you want.  Try to only change it to compensate for 
emergencies: such as a security compromise, or you've changed the number.

     You always know when someone's calling from the phone book when they ask 
for Mr. Harry Pheucksteich.  If you move and do this with another phone, do 
not use the same name twice.  If you are hiding from someone, they may come 
across someone who knows a pseudonym you've used.  They then search for this 
name, and Blammo!- your phone number and address are at their disposal.

     I hope you've enjoyed these insights and hints to make things a little 
easier on yourself.  I've saved you a few dollars: about $60/year with the 
phone and the rest depends on how much mail you send.  I'll bring you more fun 
next month.

grudge against people who write these programs, because I feel they are the 
key to exploring new areas of computing.

     The thing most people have confused, is what makes a virus - a `virus.'  
It is not its ability to do damage, instead, it is the ability to reproduce 
and make complete copies of itself that makes it a virus.

     In an interesting (but flaw ridden) article in the Winter '92 issue of 
`Online Access', the International Computer Security Association (ICSA) stated 
that "Computer viruses are programs written by high-tech vandals..."  I 
disagree.  But, what else can you expect from a government organization that 
thinks Stoned, Jerusalem, and Dark Avenger are the most recent viruses out?
     The reason I disagree has been proven in several labs and research 
facilities.  Viruses are an open door to artificial intelligence research.  I 
dislike `stupid' viruses that simply copy and destroy, but the `mutating' 
species makes an interesting study.  In one research instance, a simple virus 
was written that copied and mutated.  After studying the final products, it 
was shown that these programs had not only mutated, but had borrowed parts of 
each other's code structure to survive.  Fascinating!

     Now I have learned, via Phrack (issue #39 or #40) that CERT (Computer 
Emergency Reaction Team) has attempted to shut down a rather long list of BBSs 
that support virus research.  Is it the fear of damaging systems or are they 
simply afraid of the spreading of knowledge?  I tend to think it is the 
knowledge theory.  Closed-minded people tend to subscribe to the 'things man 
is not supposed to know' view on life.

     Anyone interested in learning more about virus programming should track 
down an old program called `Corewars.'  The premise behind this game is that 
you and your opponent both build programs that compete for CPU control.  In 
order to do this, it must build itself while trying to destroy the other.  The 
program itself is harmless to your system and is a very useful learning tool.  
Due to this fact, it is becoming difficult to find, but well worth the effort.  
I have a copy on my board (of course), and if you cannot find it, let me know.  
I'll get it to you somehow.

     I, also, recently found out that there is a group of businesses and such 
that are offering a large reward for the arrest and prosecution of any virus 
author.  For this reason, it would be a wise idea to keep a low profile for a 
while on this subject.

     In closing, I would like to say that I feel this section could be a 
useful forum for all sides.  Guest writers - both Pro and Con are invited,  
but keep flames to a minimum.  Remember that you get your point through best 
with a level head.  This will also be an open area and occasionally have a 
Question and Answer/Letters theme to help people on both sides of the issue 
cope.  In fact, I would LOVE to hear from members of CERT, ICSA, or that group 
that is offering the reward.  If any of you are interested in sharing your 
feelings, I would like to hear them.  So, please pass around this issue and 
maybe it will happen.


[There are so many different points about the Social Security issue in this 
issue, I really must let them speak for themselves.  First we show the aspect 
of the new and improved Social Security... National Health Care.]

|                   You're going to Love National Health Care              |
|                            by Edwin Krampitz, Jr.                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     You don't have to be running for office to see the United States is in 
the midst of a serious crisis in health care.  More than $650 billion was 
spent on health care in the U.S. last year, nearly triple the 1980 amount.  
Health care expenses accounted for 12% of the 1990 Gross National Product, up 
from 9% in 1980.  Over the last decade, the cost of medical care has grown at 
several times the rate of inflation, the devastating consequences for health 
insurers, employers, and individuals.  Today, some 35 million Americans have 
no health insurance.

     The solution being touted by presidential candidates and media pundits is 
national health insurance, formerly known as socialized medicine.  The 
government will provide for the health care needs of all Americans.  Joe 
Citizen can pop into any clinic or hospital anywhere in the U.S. and Uncle Sam 
will pick up the tab.  The costs will be distributed fairly and evenly through 
taxes on businesses, individuals, or both.

     This is such bullshit that it would be laughable if so many people who 
should know better weren't taking it seriously.  All we have to do is look at 
the Soviet Union's old system of socialized health care: characterized by 
shoddy work, riddled with corruption, it provided excellent work for the 
nomenklatura, the privileged few, with little or no care for the masses.  The 
British track record with socialized medicine is not much better.  One reform 
under consideration in England is to ensure that non-emergency conditions are 
treated within TWO YEARS!  That means that it, currently, takes MORE THAN two 
years to get non-emergencies treated.  Older people and those with terminal 
illnesses are routinely triaged out of the system [due to their poor chances 
of long-term survival.]  In Britain, barring unusual circumstances, no one 
over 55 years of age can get kidney dialysis through the public system.  For 
an example of how well socialized medicine will work in the United Stat!
es, simply as any retired person 

     Along with a dramatic decline in the quality of health care, we can 
expect a sharp increase in costs.  There are those who say that only the 
government can get costs under control, but when have you seen a government 
control its spending of YOUR money?  As taxpayers, we spend hundreds of 
dollars for a Defense Department hammer or a NASA ballpoint pen.  How much do 
you think a Health Department Band-Aid is going to cost us?  As for the 
quality of the service, as one observer recently put it, care givers under 
socialized medicine usually have all the compassion of tax collectors.  No one 
who has studied socialized medicine would give it a second thought here.

     Yet we move closer and closer to a national health insurance the closer 
we get to national elections.  Why?  Government reports come out on a weekly 
basis showing how awful our current health care system is.  According to a 
1991 report, American doctors are paid, on average, double what their Canadian 
counterparts make, and many U.S. doctors also profit on the side from 
diagnostic tests performed in facilities in which they own a stake.  In June 
of 1991, the General Accounting Office (GAO) went so far as to give a ringing 
endorsement of the Canadian Health Care system.  Despite the fact that 
Canadians are migrating south of the border for medical procedures that are 
unavailable on a timely basis in their home country, many bureaucrats and 
politicians are pointing to our northern neighbors as a model of universal 
health care access.

     It's true, the U.S. health care system has problems.  There seems to be 
no limit to the amount of money doctors and hospitals will spend to treat a 
patient, no matter how slim the chances for success.  And as long as the cost 
is passed on to someone else through insurance, no one seems to object to the 
outrageous sums spent on treatments that are marginal, at best.  So, yes, 
health insurance is becoming too expensive for businesses to provide, and more 
Americans are going without it.  There's no such thing as a free lunch, and so 
health care is moving away from group insurance to a pay-as-you-go system.  
But, at least in America, you can get treatment if you can scrape up the 
bucks.  Compare this to Canada, where everyone is entitled to equal health 
care - equally bad health care, and those who want to pay for something a cut 
above are unable to get it.

     Despite the fact that the Canadian health care system fails in ways that 
Americans wouldn't tolerate (if they knew what was coming), the government 
keeps pushing.  Report after report criticizes U.S. health care, and it's not 
just the Medicaid and Medicare bureaucrats trying to give all Americans what 
has been available to only a select few.  One of the most obvious features of 
the Canadian system of socialized medicine is a "health access" card, issued 
to every citizen, which must be presented at doctors' offices and hospitals to 
demonstrate coverage.  There are many in the U.S. government who've been 
trying to give us a universal identity card for years.  For such people, 
national health care insurance is one more opportunity to introduce a national 
identity card.  Consider the track record of the national identifiers:

     In the early 1970s, the head of the U.S. Passport office stated that 
Americans should be issued and required to carry a national identification 
card, according to Scott French in `The Big Brother Game', on the ground that 
the government "owes each citizen a true national identity."  Luckily, because 
of the post-Watergate mood, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 
issued this response: "The bureaucratic apparatus needed to assign and 
administer a standard universal identifier (SUI) would represent another 
imposition of government on an already heavily burdened citizenry."

     In 1982, the Senate approved a bill to combat the illegal immigration 
"problem" that would have mandated a national identification system - 
consisting of a card the every U.S. citizen would have to carry.  Columnist 
William Safire railed against the bill on libertarian grounds, and the 
legislation got no further at the time.

     During the 1980s, despite the Reagan administration's official anti-big 
government stance, new regulations increased the use of the Social Security 
number as a universal identifier, despite the statements of the Social 
Security Administration, originally, that the number was only meant for SSA 
use, and despite the passage of the Privacy Act in 1974 forbidding most other 
uses of the SSN.  (When President Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned for a 
second term in 1936 using Social Security as a campaign issue, some observers 
had the foresight to ask where it would lead.  The Hearst newspapers asked: 
"Do You Want a Tag and a Number in the Name of False Security?")

     By the late 1980s, as Robert Anton Wilson pointed out in the pages of the 
1989 Loompanics Main Catalog, California required that all passengers, not 
just the driver, in a vehicle stopped by police carry identification.
I guess, once again, to combat the illegal alien `problem.'  Today's trends in 
California often become tomorrow's mandates nationwide.

     In July, 1989, after a two-year study, a federal task force, mandated by 
Congress, to study the problem of "criminals and the deranged" getting 
firearms came up with one option that should now be familiar to readers:  a 
national identification card that every adult citizen would have to carry.  
The twist is, that this would be a "smart card," a card with an electronic 
chip the size of a fingernail embedded in it, instead of the more familiar 
magnetic strip on the back.  The card's chip would contain encoded identifying 
information: fingerprints, genetic data, a retinal scan, etc., as well as 
one's criminal conviction record and, presumably, medical record.  When a gun 
is bought, the dealer would use a decoder to read the purchaser's smart card 
and then electronically tie in the gun's serial number to the purchaser 
(presumably in some central government data bank.)

     The U.S. Army is considering adopting a smart card being developed by 
Syscon Corporation to replace soldiers' traditional dog tags.  During the 
1991, Persian Gulf War, a Syscon representative indicated that "The Saudi 
Arabian government could certainly use the system today to keep tabs on who is 
inside their country.  They'd be able to distinguish terrorist from refugee."  
Smart cards have been in use in Europe for a few years already, and are also 
being used by a number of private companies.

     One of the main advantages the U.S. government sees in Canadian-style 
national health insurance is the issuance of a national "health access" card.  
Under the guise of protecting the taxpayer from fraud, the government will 
require that everyone sign up for a health card.  And, with smart card 
technology, the government will want some sort of genetic sampling or DNA 
typing embedded in the card.  After all, in addition to being an identifier, 
the card will help medical professionals provide treatment by revealing 
important biological information.

     Perhaps you are beginning to see where this new health card is leading?  
Did you know that every time you use a cash machine, the machine updates the 
magnetic stripe on your ATM card, so the bank can keep track of how often you 
use the card and what you use it for?  Well, you can imagine what a health 
access smart-card will be like.  It will update your medical history every 
time you use it.  Any illness you have: broken bones, syphilis, AIDS, mental 
abnormalities, [deviant status,] etc, will be noted on the card.  Your entire 
medical history will be available to anyone who has your card and the 
technology to read it.  And that technology has to be cheap and widely 
available in order for the system to work.  You'll see card readers in every 
drug store, every doctor's office and clinic, every hospital, and every 
government office that deals with the bureaucracy of health care.  [They'll 
probably be available for mail-order in the back of subversive publications.]

     So now they have a smart card with your medical history on it... what's 
next?  Well, you never know when you're going to be in an accident, so 
everyone should HAVE to carry their health cards with them at all times.  And 
since everyone has to carry one at all times, isn't it convenient to check for 
health cards when you're looking for illegal aliens?  And wouldn't it be a 
good idea for convicted drunk drivers to have that information embedded in 
their health cards?  In fact, shouldn't anyone convicted of ANY crime have 
that noted on their health card?  Why should people be burdened with having to 
carry a Social Security card, and a driver's license, and all those other 
cards, when all that stuff can be included on their health card?

     Eventually, your health card is going to be required for any major 
transaction: check writing, check cashing, cash machine use, car rental, hotel 
reservations, airline reservations, prior to accepting employment, to register 
for school, to sign up for garbage removal, etc.  When that day comes, even 
your library rentals will be shown on your smart card.  And everyone will go 
along.  Because, with the government spending billions of dollars on health 
care, the health card will be an essential weapon in the battle against fraud.  
And it will be a convenient way to keep track of criminals.  And it will make 
it easy for the IRS to catch tax cheats.  So, if you have nothing else to 
hide, you have nothing to fear from a smart health access card, right?  
Everyone will go along.

     And maybe ten years from now or so, you're going to be in line at the 
hospital waiting for some bureaucrat to decide whether or not, given your 
genetic make-up, you should be allowed to go on living.  And maybe you'll be 
thinking back to that election when Joe Politician said, "We need a national 
health care system like Canada's."  And maybe you'll be wishing people had 
thought it through a little more.



[Now let's hit on the highlights of how social security doesn't even do what 
is was intended to do... If you're counting on those checks in the future, 
this one should interest you...]

     If you were born after 1936, don't count on Social Security to make your 
retirement years comfortable.  The Social Security system will be in serious 
trouble within ten years, and the crunch will be devastating when the baby-
boomers start arriving at retirement age around 2010.

     Social Security has expanded its coverage and benefits so much that this 
year it will pay out $302 billion!  That's $830 million a day to retired 
workers and their spouses, widows, and dependent children and the disabled.  
As it stands, there simply will not be enough money to pay promised benefits.

     Social `insecurity' will be one of the most important issues of the next 
decade.  By knowing what's ahead, you can plan your future now to compensate 
for what you won't be getting from Social Security.

	So many myths surround the Social Security system that it's difficult 
for most people to face the hard facts.

Myth: Social Security is a pension.  Workers pay in taxes, contributions,
      and the government returns the money in monthly Social Security
      checks.
Reality: In almost every case, retirees get back all of their taxes in three
         or four years.  A worker retiring now, who paid say $34K in Social
         Security taxes, will get back $160K during retirement years... or
         nearly $250K if there's a non-working spouse.  And that's before
         cost-of-living adjustments.

Myth: Social Security payroll taxes are kept in trust funds from which
      benefits are paid.
Reality: Social Security has always been a pay-as-you-go system.  Current
         taxpayers support current retirees.  In 1950 there were fifteen
         workers for every retiree.  Today there are just three.  By 2010,
         there will be even fewer.

Myth: Today's surplus will provide for the retirement of the baby boomers.
Reality: Although the system's current surplus is now over $300 billion,
         and is projected to be $1 trillion in the year 2000, that won't
         help future retirees.  Payroll taxes not needed to pay current
         benefits are `invested' in Special Issue Government bonds.  The
         cash is spent on current government operations and the Treasury
         creates an IOU to the Social Security system.  When the Social
         Security system needs to tap into its reserves in 2010, the
         Treasury will have to ask the Congress to raise the money, by
         raising or creating new taxes, so Social Security can redeem the
         IOUs.

Myth: Most people work all their lives to be able to spend a few years in
      retirement.
Reality: On average, individuals spend only half their lives in the labor
         force.  In the past, most of an individual's life was spent at
         work.  Schooling ended early.  And when people retired from their
         jobs, they were generally very near the end of their lives.

Myth: Current beneficiaries paid the taxes that helped create and maintain
      the program.  It's only fair that the young continue to maintain the
      program as their elders built it.
Reality: Social Security has always been a wealth transfer from young to
         old.  The burden on the young was relatively light in the past
         because there were so many of them and so few old people.  Times
         have changed.  Last year, more than 70% of families paid more in
         Social Security taxes that in income taxes.  And those same younger
         workers face the prospect of low benefits later.

     Clearly changes have to be made in the Social Security system.  Most 
talked about...

     - Raise the eligibility age for benefits to 70.  It's slated now to rise 
to 67 by the year 2010.  Cut or eliminate benefits for early retirement at 62 
(which a majority of the people now take.)

     - Slow the growth of benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments 
(COLAs).  `Diet COLAs' might have individuals receiving, say, more than $1,000 
in monthly benefits getting only half of the increase.

     - Privatize.  One way:  give people "refunds" of a part of their Social 
Security taxes.  But require them to use the money for retirement savings.  
They would have control over how it is invested.

     - Invest the current Social Security surplus in projects that could pay 
the money back, such as rebuilding the nation's infrastructure.

     - Invest Social Security funds in private securities.  Other countries do 
so successfully.

     - Require a means test.  Higher income people may be unable to collect 
anymore than they paid in payroll taxes.  Wealthy people may be unable to 
collect at all.  Probably everyone will pay taxes on their benefits.

     Just as important, government has to help people help themselves to a 
secure retirement.  Some proposals...

     - Create savings incentives by restoring the fully tax deductible 
Individual Retirement Account for all Americans.

     - Encourage the growth of private pensions.  Of all the money retired 
people receive today, only fifteen percent comes from private pensions.  
Congress should simplify pension laws and regulations so the pot of money, and 
the number of people, grows.

     - Make private pensions portable so a worker can carry vested assets 
when changing jobs.

     - Increase allowable contributions by employees to private pensions.  In 
most cases they are much to low.

     With all of these changes, if you want to have a secure retirement, you 
must recognize that Social Security is only one small part of your retirement 
plan.  On the average, Social Security today replaces forty percent of working 
income subject to Social Security tax.  (Sixty percent, if you include 
benefits for a non-working spouse.)  In the future, the prudent planner will 
be looking to other sources for at least seventy-five percent of retirement 
income.  So, you have to accumulate substantial assets to ensure an ample flow 
of income later.

     Save as much as you can through pension plans and other instruments such 
as IRAs and 401(k)s and Keoghs, which provide significant tax advantages.

Simple Saving Strategy

     Begin with a disciplined plan.  Make out your first check each month to 
yourself, for your retirement plan.  Save at least ten percent of your gross 
salary.

     Set dollar goals for your retirement income factoring in the erosion 
caused by inflation.  The results can be scary.

     Make quality your investment guide.  Retirement savings should never be 
at risk.  There are always safe, rewarding opportunities in government bonds 
and the shares of quality corporations.  Remember, however, that the `safety' 
of these investments relies upon the stability of our government.

     Diversify (but not too much.)  No, one, particular holding should be more 
than ten percent, at cost, of your total funds or fifteen percent at market 
value.  In down periods, make shifts so that fifty percent or more is in debt 
instruments.  Examples:  quality straight and zero-coupon bonds... mortgage-
backed funds.

     At all times, be comfortable with your investments.  If you have any 
qualms about a potential holding, don't buy it.  Your goal is sure, ample 
assets at retirement.

     Review your portfolio periodically, at least annually and more often in 
erratic markets.  Always strive to keep it in balance.  Too often, when you 
pick a winner, you keep adding shares.  Before you know it, thirty percent of 
your portfolio may be concentrated in one stock, and that's too much.

     Be patient.  It takes time to make money safely.  And, if you start 
early, you will have plenty of time.

[Now we take a look at the `Big Brother' effect that the Social Security 
Administration has had on us... What direction is this whole thing going?  
Let's take a look...]

     Some day soon, you'll be pulled over for a traffic violation, don't be 
surprised to hear the officer say, "I need to see your license, registration, 
and worker card."  Excuse me.  Worker Card?  What's a worker card?

     A worker card, or something like it, will be a national identity card, 
issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and required for all 
Americans who seek work.  Eventually, it will be required for all 
identification purposes.  While there is still a great deal of resistance in 
the United States to a national identity card, there is growing pressure from 
Washington D.C. to adopt such a system.  Whether it will fully come to pass 
remains to be seen.  However, the bureaucrats aren't waiting for a referendum 
to start the national identity ball rolling.

     There are many people in the federal government and in law enforcement 
who would like to see the United States adopt a national identity document.  
To be effective, this document would be required for all citizens and it would 
be mandatory to carry it on one's person at all times.  The refrain "May I see 
your papers?" is not yet a reality in the United States, but it may be soon.  
Certain steps are being taken right now to allow the creation of such a 
national identity system.

     If this sounds chilling, it should.  In the United States, only those who 
were convicted of serious crimes must register with the police, and we can 
still get a passport even if we owe the IRS a  little money.  But changes are 
coming, slowly and surely, one step at a time.  The first big step occurred in 
1986, when the Immigration Reform and Control Act was passed by Congress.  
Although it was sold as a way to control illegal immigration and the 
employment of illegal aliens, it contains record keeping provisions that will 
allow for the creation of a similar type of national identity database that 
exists in most European countries.

The Immigration Act of 1986

     The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 has three provisions:  an 
illegal immigrant naturalization program 1000 new border patrol agents, and 
new record-keeping requirements for employers.  The record-keeping 
requirements have set the stage for a new national identity program.

     Under the provisions of the act, all employers must have proof of any 
worker's identity and eligibility to work in the United States.  A prospective 
employer must, under penalty of law, fill out a form that requests at least 
two types of identification from the new employee.  [The I-9 Form]  One piece 
of ID can be a drivers license or state identity card, or something similar.  
The second piece must be either a birth certificate or Social Security card.  
The employer is required to maintain these forms on all workers and make them 
available to immigration inspectors upon request.  The employer is not under 
any obligation to verify the accuracy of the documents presented, only to 
maintain a record of them.

     Currently, a demonstration project is going on in Texas that allows 
employers to verify Social Security numbers over the telephone.  The project 
is being implemented in a few Texas cities that have large numbers of illegal 
immigrants who work in seasonal jobs, such as construction.  Many of these 
illegal immigrants have purchased phoney Social Security cards and use them to 
get work.  Under this pilot project, a special Social Security office was set 
up to handle requests for verification from employers.  This special Social 
Security office is generally able to provide an answer within a day on whether 
a SSN is valid.  

     This is a major shift in US identification for two reasons.  First, a 
huge SSA database is being accessed directly by outside groups for identity 
verification purposes.  Second, it brings us a step closer to turning the 
information that employers must now collect into an active database run by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  How would this database 
function?  When a new employee is hired, the employer completes two copies of 
the INS form.  The original goes into the employer's files and the copy is 
mailed to a regional INS office where the data is entered into INS computers.  

     The INS would then offer an on-line computer match of SSN against the 
SSA's database.  For the first time, almost all Americans would have a file 
with a law enforcement agency.  After all, the INS is an enforcement agency 
within The US Justice Department.  The database that would be created out of 
this process will be enormous because almost all people eventually enter the 
labor force.  While this database is not a full-fledged national identity 
system, one key requirement has been met:  a single, nationwide, detailed, and 
up-to-date database that includes most people in the country.

The Role of the States

     The United States is unique among nations because of our highly 
decentralized identification bureaucracy.  Almost all identification comes 
from state governments and not the federal government.  A check of the average 
American's wallet will usually reveal no federal identity documents.  The only 
federally issued identity document most Americans will have is the Social 
Security card and most people do not carry it on their person.  A passport is 
another piece of federally issued identification, but only 25% of all 
Americans will ever have a passport.

     From this, it is clear that for any future US national identity system to 
work, it will require cooperation from the states.  This will be accomplished 
in two ways:  data sharing with the federal government, and the 
standardization of the format of state-issued identity documents.  Let's look 
at data sharing first.

     The focal point of the national identity system to come will be the 
database the INS builds as employers provide information on employees.  As 
this data is received by the INS, "John Doe's" file will be updated with his 
new employer and home address.  This allows the database to develop a 
sequential history of everyone in it.  People tend to keep updated records of 
themselves with their employers to insure that paychecks and benefits are 
received without delay.  The INS database will be updated each time a person 
changes jobs, so it will be very current indeed.

     Data sharing allows the federal government to expand the database even 
further.  With access to state drivers license records, motor vehicle records 
and the SSA's files, the INS would be capable of creating an ominous data 
base.  Presto!  Gone are all the barriers between state and federal data 
bases.  The states will go along with it because the Feds will tell them that 
it will allow them to catch fugitives from justice more easily.  For the first 
time a federal law enforcement agency will be in routine custody of massive 
personal data files on nearly every American.

     The second critical element the federal government will push is 
standardization of state identity documents.  The Feds will encourage the 
states to use coding and numbering patterned after the SSN as their drivers 
license number.  The federal government wants all states to do this.  Although 
the physical appearance of the license may differ from state to state, the 
coding will be identical.  This brings us closer to a national drivers license 
and a national identity card.  As you can see, the SSA will play a key role in 
allowing the federal government to pull all of these sources together.  Let's 
see how.

Social Security's Vital Role

      The closest equivalent in the United States to a person-number is the 
SSN.  This is because your SSN is the only truly unique identifier you have.  
In a country the size of the United States, there may be other people with the 
same first, middle, and last names as your.  Certainly, there are many other 
people with your same date of birth.  But your SSN is a unique identifier.  
That's why the federal government urged the states to use this number on 
state-issued identity documents until the Privacy Act of 1974 prohibited this 
requirement.  This act says that states can ask for your number, but they 
cannot refuse you a service if you fail to provide it.

     The federal government has gradually tried to punch holes in the Privacy 
Act's protection of SSNs.  When draft registration became mandatory in 1980, 
the Selective Service board was given access to birth data in the SSA's files.  
Using information from these files, the Selective Service generates lists of 
18-year old males who have failed to register for the draft.

     SSNs allow numerous databases to be pulled together quickly and to be 
indexed by a unique numerical sequence.  But to make a SSN into a genuine 
person-number requires a few more steps.  First, everyone must be required to 
have a number.  The IRS has taken a step that provides a big boost in that 
direction.  The IRS now requires that all children over five years of age must 
have a SSN in order to be claimed as deductions on income tax returns.  This 
policy has resulted in millions of young Americans getting SSNs.

     The next requirement is to be able to "retire" SSNs once someone has 
died.  All countries that use a person-number system, permanently retire a 
number when its holder dies.  In the United States, the SSA is making progress 
toward just a system.

     When a person who has been collecting Social Security benefits dies, the 
SSA places his or her number into a special database.  The SSA has been trying 
to get states to report the death of anyone receiving state benefits so the 
information can be recorded in the federal database.  The SSA would like it to 
become routine practice to be notified by states of any deaths.  Over time, 
the SSA will build up a repository of retired numbers.  Coupled with most 
Americans receiving numbers early in life, a close approximation of a person-
numbering system is being created around the SSN.

     Another essential step is to be able to distinguish between numbers 
issued to US citizens and those issued to non-citizens.  This is now being 
done.  Non-Americans who do not have the right to work in the United States 
are given Social Security cards that have the legend NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT 
printed across them.  [Then what's the point of the card?!?      -Daiv]  Also, 
the SSA forwards information on all foreign nationals to the INS.

     Another feature of a true person-numbering system is the ability to track 
the foreign travel of citizens.  The United States has already set such a 
tracking system in motion.  As of January, 1989, it became mandatory to 
provide one's SSN to get a passport.  The number is included in the machine 
readable coding on modern passports.  Whenever a person returns from a trip 
overseas, the first agency they deal with is the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service.  When your passport is presented to the immigration 
officer upon arrival, a record of your return is added to the INS database.  
The link between this and your other files is the SSN.

How It Will Be Sold To The Public

     The necessary steps to create a national identification system are in 
their nascent stage.  The INS will probably run the system.  A final step will 
be the issuance of a "United States Authorized Worker Card," or some similarly 
named document.  The issuing agency would, of course, be the INS.  Being a law 
enforcement agency, the INS would likely have access to the FBI's central 
records system.  Without a question, these records would then be integrated 
into the INS database.

     The FBI has two primary databases.  One is the National Crime Information 
Center, or "NCIC."  this is the computer system that your name is run through 
any time you are pulled over for a traffic violation.  The NCIC contains the 
names of fugitives and information on stolen property, as well as the names of 
certain missing persons.  The FBI also maintains a criminal records index 
containing information on anyone convicted of a federal offense.  The INS will 
have access to these files, and will no doubt check each new piece of 
information against the FBI's files.

     Now you can see how this system will be sold to the public.  The federal 
government will proclaim the illegal immigration is out of control and 
foreigners are taking jobs that rightfully belong to Americans.  We will also 
be told that these immigrants are a major source of crime, and that the only 
way to stop the flow of illegal immigrants is to issue an identity card that 
only U.S. citizens or lawfully-admitted aliens are allowed to carry.  We will 
be told that this is not a "national identity card," but simply a card that 
shows that the holder is entitled to work in the United States.  The reality, 
as we have seen here, is completely different.

National Identity And Privacy

     As should be obvious to knowledgeable privacy seekers, a national 
identity system does not mean the end of our privacy.  The classic methods of 
identity changing would still allow you to penetrate the new national identity 
system on your own terms.  Using a mail drop, your home address can remain 
unknown to the data hounds.  Using a fake birth certificate and supporting 
documents, you can still create a completely fictitious legal identity for day 
to day use, thus leaving your natural legal identity untouched - a blank slate 
to be used when needed.

     The coming national identity system will not alter any of the traditional 
methods of identity creation.  You still build up a paper person's background 
as you do now.  The only difference is, once you have obtained all your state-
issued identity documents - your birth certificate, drivers license, voter 
registration card, etc. - you make a final stop at the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to pick up your "Worker Card."  All identity systems 
rely on paper and numbers; learn to manipulate the paper and numbers, and you 
can manipulate your official identity and the corresponding benefits and 
penalties.

[Now to sum up how the American public became schmoozed to buy this shit in 
the first place!]

|                           by George T. Knoblauch                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    "Folks... have we got a good deal for the American people.  With all the 
soup kitchens, with all the hungry people waiting in line for food, with all 
the elderly people with no place to sleep or call home, we've decided to 
implement a program to eliminate the chances for anything like that ever 
happening again."

    "It won't cost the average person much at all.  We will put a small charge 
on the salary of all working people. Each employer will contribute a larger 
amount.  All these monies will be put into an insurance fund.  Employers will 
be able to afford the higher assessment.  After all, look at all the profits 
they make.  We will pay these funds to everyone at age 65 so no one will ever 
have to worry about their golden years again."

    "In fact, to be fair to the women, we will begin to pay them at age 62 
since women have less earning power and outlive their husbands.  The citizens 
will now have fewer problems as they get older and receive benefits from this 
system."

     This system will be called Social Security.  It's time for the government 
to take care of it's hard working people."

     The length and depth of the depression in the early 1930s was a 
significant selling point for the social security program.  Many researchers 
and historians claim the depression was orchestrated.  Behind the scenes power 
brokers wanted the slump to give the government reason to implement 
socialistic programs.  There is much reading available in this area of history 
also. 

     This adventure in socialism began in earnest in August 1935 when Congress 
passed the Social Security Act.  The act established the Social Security 
Board.  It consisted of 3 members who were chosen by the President and 
approved by the Senate.  They were to be so independent that they were to 
report directly to the president.  This continued until 1939 when the board 
became part of the Federal Security Agency.  They created this agency to 
include health and education activities. 

     Health and education activities?  It looks as though our government 
recognized the importance of educating the people in socialist principles way 
back in 1939. 

     What a farce.  What a sham put over on the American people.  Show me 
where there is any security in socialism?  I'm not twisting words around.  
That's exactly what Social Security means... security in socialism.  Let me 
tell you there is NO SECURITY IN SOCIALISM!

     Our federal government has been violating the law since the beginning of 
this program.  There is no permission in our Constitution for any socialist 
programs.  We gave no authority for free cheese, specific welfare such as food 
stamps, medicare, medicaid or Social Security.

     How did our nation ever manage 146 years without such an idiotic program?  
Didn't we have any people who lived to be 65?  How did they ever survive 
without big brother looking out for them?  How did our country manage to 
endure with all those old people dying right in our streets?  Did we just 
allow them to starve to death with no handouts from government? 

     Regardless, you say, they only have our own good in mind.  Don't you 
believe it!  There is only one thing they have in mind... the destruction of 
our Constitution.  Control of the American people is also high on their list.  
Looking at social security practically, it is simply another form of taxation.  
The operation of the taxing provisions of the social security system are now 
part of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Encyclopedia Americana tells us "The term 'social security' is usually 
employed to indicate specific government programs designed primarily to 
prevent want by assuring to families the basic means of subsistence."

     How white of them.  What business is it of government?  Where can you 
find any authorization in our Constitution for programs to prevent want?  They 
are encroaching into lives of citizens without a legal right.  
Unconstitutional... it's a seizure of powers we did not grant when we 
established the authority for government.  If they assume any power we did not 
allow, it's illegal.  That's pretty strong, so now let's go ahead and prove 
it.

     The supremacy clause of our Constitution makes that crystal clear.  We 
have established that our document is the supreme law of our land.

     Any laws made which don't conform to the authority we granted in the 
basic document are NO GOOD!

     And if that weren't plain enough for the people working for government, 
the Tenth Amendment clears that up.


ARTICLE X

      "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
       nor  prohibited by it to the States,  are reserved to  the States
       respectively or to the people."


     I'm certain any reader can understand that.  Why do you suppose the 
federal government can't understand it?  Is it possible they prefer to think 
the Tenth Amendment doesn't exist?  Either that is true or this is an obvious 
case of collusion between the branches of our government.

     Recently a program concerning our Constitution aired on PBS. The 
moderator said he had gone to every lawyer and judge he could find the day 
before the program.  He asked if any of them knew what the Tenth amendment 
said and NOT ONE could answer his question!  Not one even knew the general 
subject matter of the amendment.  Does our Constitution still exist?  So much 
for our intelligent judges and lawyers.  Give me a break.

     When the first twelve proposed amendments were submitted to the states in 
1789 to become our Bill of Rights, the Congress included this introductory 
statement (or preamble):

     "The Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of
      their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to
      prevent  misconceptions  or abuse of its  powers,  that  further
      declaratory  and  restrictive  clauses should  be added:  And as
      extending  the ground  of public  confidence in the  Government,
      will  best  insure  the  beneficent  ends  of  its  institution:"

    (Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union of the American 
States.  House Document No. 398, 69th Congress, 1st Session 1965)

     The First Congress is assuring the people that these new amendments will 
be a tighter rope to confine the government.  And the legal eagles today do 
not know what the tenth amendment says or means?  When we get into a 
discussion of the Bill of Rights, you will quickly see how the federales 
believe the preceding preamble.

     Going back to our venture into socialism, let's take a look at the 
numbers for a moment.  What happens to the money which a man has paid into the 
system for 40 or more years?  And what if he should die before he becomes 
eligible to collect benefits?  Does it go to his wife or survivors?  You know 
better than that.  It's gone... it has become a gratuitous donation to Big 
Brother.  An amount equal to taxes collected from individuals are assessed 
from their employers.  All this money goes to the general fund and spent for 
anything, legal or illegal.

     And assuming there is now a widow, what would she receive from his 
donations?  Certainly not the amount paid into the system, nor even the 
interest on those funds.  How many of our elderly citizens do not have enough 
money to pay for their rent, utilities or food?  We won't even mention an 
occasional night out to the movies or a vacation to enjoy their remaining 
years.  How many of our older citizens have to depend on a church function for 
a meal?  How many wait at the Salvation Army or some other private charity for 
Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner?  This is a crime.  What did they say was the 
intent of the Social Security program?  "To prevent want by assuring to 
families the basic means of subsistence."

     Horse manure!  People for generations have been led to believe that this 
program would take care of them in later years.  What's the story we hear 
often now?  The program will be broke in 'X' numbers of years.  Mercy, it's 
running out of money so we have to increase the withholding levels.  The 
government, the way it is running today, is the solution to nothing... it's 
the problem.

     Alexander Hamilton argued fervently in Paper No. 84 that we did not need 
a Bill of Rights since the Constitution was in itself a bill of rights. He 
asks the question, "For why declare that things shall not be done which there 
is no power to do?"  (The Federalist Papers.)  He insisted that the national 
government could do nothing which was not specifically allowed in the 
document.  However the Congress proposed a Bill of Rights.  It was adopted to 
further tie down the new government to prohibit any abuse of its powers.

     How does this government get itself involved in the business of welfare 
or social security?  The amendment process was not invoked to ask for our 
consent agreeing to a change.  I didn't agree to any change allowing for 
socialism, did you?

     Can our constitution be changed by an act of Congress or by an order by 
the executive branch?  Maybe an order by a federal judge can do it.  Not true!  
It can only be changed under Article V if you and I agree to the change at the 
voting booth.  So--did you agree to the change?  Remember what the Tenth 
Amendment said?

     Let's pretend for a moment there was no social security program enacted.  
The people had not been lulled into a false sense of protection by a devious 
government.  Suppose then the people had put the same amount of money into a 
savings account for the same period.  They could retire very comfortably on 
the interest alone.

     Let's carry our fairy tale a little further.  As in the previous 
illustration, let's say a man paid into a trust fund for 30 or 40 years.  Then 
he died before reaching 65.  What would the family live on in a case like 
this?  Why all the money which had not been donated to big government.  His 
widow and entire family could live extremely well on the interest received 
from the trust fund.  And there would be money for education.  That would be 
if our government in their 'wisdom' had not tried to exercise control over 
people in violation of our basic law.

     I don't, for a moment, suggest that we cut off social security payments 
tomorrow.  There is no question what the outcome of such a drastic measure 
would be.  The vastness of the dilemma and the people who exist only because 
of those meager payments shows a real problem.  The program should be phased 
out over the next 15 to 20 years.

     People who are now paying into the system should be given the option for 
their money to be withheld as it is presently.  If they so choose, the money 
can go into a private trust to gain interest and increase in value. The 
difference now being that these monies will remain the property of the one 
allowing the deductions.  Naturally, it would pass on to his or her heirs as 
with any other property.  Congress could not use this money for any 
expenditure they feel the urge to implement.  For example, they couldn't use 
these funds to raise their own salaries at whim.

     For others who don't want money taken out of their salaries, they should 
drop out of the system altogether.  Government has no right to intrude into 
the private affairs of Americans.  "But when a long train of abuses and 
usurpations, pursing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce 
them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw 
off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security."  
(Declaration of Independence.)

     The lone woman on the Supreme Court (Sandra Day O'Conner) remarked to a 
TV reporter one day that she used to think Social Security was 
unconstitutional.  Now she doesn't think so... wonder who gave her the 
indoctrination?

     How do we correct the situation?  Since Congress created the boondoggle, 
Congress will have to be the ones to change it.  Call the local offices of 
your Senators and Representatives and ask questions about this adventure in 
socialism.  Be certain to point out the lack of jurisdiction for these type of 
programs.  Tell them you want something done about this violation of our 
Constitution.  Further, remind them you will be watching to see what is being 
done. Phone calls every couple of weeks wouldn't be too often.  It has to be 
impressed on their minds that these socialistic programs have to cease.

     I'm certain you will hear a story like, "These things are so interwoven 
in the fabric of our society, they would be impossible to change."  Remind our 
illustrious 'leaders' that if any practice was unconstitutional when it began, 
it is still unconstitutional.  No amount of usage will make the practice legal 
or give it an illusion of respectability. 

     There was never any intent on the part of the Founders to allow the 
phrase "general welfare" to signify a right to establish any specific welfare 
programs.  To find the origin of this statement, we must look to our first 
compact of government, The Articles of Confederation.

     Article III states: "The said states hereby severally enter into a firm 
league of friendship with each other, for their common defence, the security 
of their Liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves 
to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, 
or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade,  or any  other 
pretence whatever." (Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union)

     From this it's obvious what the term general welfare means.  There is no 
need to insult the readers intelligence to imply that the general welfare 
clause magically became authorization for specific welfare.

     Another area in our Constitution which they may argue is permission for 
social security, is the "necessary and proper" clause (Art I, Sec 8).  That's 
weak and won't hold water.  This only gives power to make laws which are 
necessary and proper to carry out the duties and powers listed in the basic 
document.  It's not for anything they decide is a great idea.

     Hamilton, in Paper #78, said:  "There is no position which depends on 
clearer principles than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to 
the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void."  Anything 
they do which is beyond what we have allowed or agreed to is void.

     To aspire to the greatness this country was destined to achieve, we must 
demand our government obey the law.  It must return to the confines to which 
we agreed when the Constitution was established.

     If you ever see the original of our Constitution (or an exact copy), the 
first three words use decorative letters. WE THE PEOPLE.  Their authority for  
government  comes from us and  only we can agree to a change.

     If the members of Congress are not receptive to our demands, we have a 
duty to vote them out of office.  We must send Americans to Washington who 
will obey the oath to support the supremacy of our Constitution which we 
ordered in Article VI, Sec 3.

     For this evil to continue, all we need do is nothing!  There is a limit 
to their power and that limit is you and me.

     Recently, in a controversy concerning the poor and food, Reagan put his 
foot in his mouth.  (Or, maybe it was Nancy's foot!)  He said the poor were 
unable to find food or stamps due to a lack of knowledge.  A late-night 
comedian commented that if that is true, his staff must be starving to death!  
'Nuff said.



[Since there's not a lot of things that pertain to food and the SSA, Storm 
decided to go in a little different direction.]

Vivisection:
     To dissect, maim, mutilate or experiment upon a living body.  Sounds 
pretty, don't it?

     What would YOU do if they tested a new dog shampoo by feeding it to 
children?  We wouldn't allow it!  Would we?  Yet millions of animals are still 
blinded, shocked, decapitated, and force-fed poisons.  These tests can and 
have been (by some companies) replaced with alternatives:  Tests using 
advanced technology not torture.

     People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA) has stopped some of 
the most barbaric experiments.  But SOME continue to test their products at 
the expense of the lives of animals.

General Motors- The Heartbreak of America

     No law requires cars to be tested for safety using animals.  However, GM 
continues to smash the skulls and break the necks of ferrets and pigs with 
pneumatic impactors, like those used on baboons at the notorious University of 
Pennsylvania Head Injury Laboratory which was exposed by animal rights 
activists in 1984.

     When asked why GM doesn't just use crash dummies, GM spokesman, Jack 
Dinan replied, "The anthropomorphic dummies provide readings on electrical 
instruments...but they don't scream out in pain- they don't bleed..."

     GM Vice President, Robert A. Frosh told PeTA: "Be assured, we believe 
that biomedical research should only be conducted when human lives may be 
saved or human suffering relieved."  If the alleviation of suffering and death 
is important to GM, why hasn't the company installed air bags as standard 
equipment in its cars and trucks?

     "There's no substitute for animal research."  That's like saying, "You 
can only get there by driving," when you can get there by walking, flying, 
bicycling, riding in a train, or roller skating.

     "Animals are here for human beings to use; if we have to sacrifice 1,000 
or 100,000 animals in the hope of benefitting ONE child, it's worth it."  If 
experimenting on ONE mentally retarded person might benefit 1,000 children, 
would we do it?  Of course not!

L'oreal: The Nazi Connection

     In his story, `The Letter Writer,' Nazi concentration camp survivor, 
Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote: "In relation to [other creatures], all people are 
Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka."

     Interestingly, in the spring of '91, the Paris-based newspaper `The 
European' reported that the chairman of L'oreal's U.S. company, Cosmair was a 
leader of pro-Nazi groups during WWII and that L'oreal would soon be 
investigated for allegedly current racist business dealings.

     Companies, such as L'oreal, Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette, Proctor and 
Gamble, etc. have been performing lethal dose tests (now sometimes called 
`limit tests' by public relations conscious laboratories) since the 1920's. In 
the test's most common form, the compound, liquid bleach, for example, is 
force fed by mouth or through a tube inserted down the throat.  Typical 
symptoms of animals poisoned in these tests include convulsions, vomiting, 
diarrhea, paralysis, and bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth.  The 
survivors are killed for examination.

     Six to nine albino rabbits are placed in stocks to prevent them from 
clawing their eyes to dislodge the substances, but have their heads and necks 
protruding.  The lower lid of each animal's eye is pulled away from the 
eyeball to form a cup.  Into that cup, a technician drops several milligrams 
of a substance to be tested.  With a particularly caustic substance, the 
rabbits scream in pain.

     These are but a few of the atrocities committed in our genocidal 
concentration camps known as "research labs."  Our most common commercial 
household items are deemed safe by how few hamsters, kittens, or dogs go blind 
or develop cancer.

     Is our basic human vanity worth all this?  Especially when technology has 
proven these tests unnecessary.  These experiments on live animals are NOT 
required by law and warning labels on products that could prove dangerous if 
inhaled, swallowed, or dropped into an eye could suffice insofar as providing 
safety measures.

     You may also wish to contact the manufacturers of your favorite products 
and express your concern of their practices. Suggest to them, that if they 
wish to retain their customers, alternatives to vivisection would be an 
important agenda to them.

     "The greatness of a nation and it's moral progress can be judged by the 
way its animals are treated."           - Gandhi

Why we do What we do the Way we do:
by Anesthesia

     Well, after the first couple of issues were released, I've been getting 
some letters from people I used to know.  Mostly, they want to know why I've 
backed down a bit from my previously `violent' and technical form of writing.  
There are several reasons why.  I think it may help you  understand if I share 
them with you.

     A long while ago, I wrote a few text files on how to terrorize your 
school, how to blow things up, and other such things.  It recently dawned on 
me that I was just doing what everyone else was doing.  I never really liked 
being just one of the many lemmings [Baa-aa-aa  -Daiv] in a group, so I took a 
break and almost quit doing all the things that I used to do.  Then I met a 
few people who changed my destiny.  One of these people was David Lightman.  
He has many unique views on how the world runs, and that made me remember why 
I started doing this in the first place.

     So, here I am, writing again.  Some people have said I am an `old, soft 
relic that should be put away.'  Well, I don't subscribe to that point of 
view.  Just like double standards and corruption in the government, I'll be 
around for a long, long time!

     Mainly the reason I keep myself `in check' here is because I realized 
that I was sharing a lot of potentially dangerous ideas and thoughts.  I, 
also, see lots of others doing the same thing.  I wasn't given any background, 
safety, or direction with these views.  Phirst Amendment gives me that avenue.

     Eventually, I do plan on becoming more technical in my writing, but I 
will feel a lot better about it, knowing that I've set down some direction and 
other rudiments in these first issues.

     In other words, I enjoy writing for the beginner, and helping them work 
their way up through the ranks.  Plus, it excites me to have people think and 
show them how to see things a different way.  I hope you enjoy this magazine.  
I also hope you stay tuned for the harder stuff,

Once upon A Christmas Hacker
____________________________________________________________________________

     Another Christmas has passed us by!  That means even more folks got 
modems and more boards will go up.  Unfortunately, about the time you'll read 
this, we'll be hit with another 'Night of the Poser Hackers.'  Actually, it is 
usually more than a night...  more like a month.

     This is the time of the year that all new kids want to enter our digital 
Underground world.  Some of them will stay and some will get frustrated, but 
it's still inevitable.  Just make sure to tell these new ones to watch what 
they say.  One day, this may cause the end of us all.

     I have always had this terrible nightmare that some poser will blow the 
lid off the ancient culture of ours.  I have been involved for over thirteen 
years now and would hate to see it die.  I've seen MIT go from hacker heaven 
to just another place.  I've seen the rise and fall of the LoD (Legion of 
Doom.)  And I've seen the inception of government agencies to deal with 
hacking.  I'm still here and so are you!  Let's keep it that way!

     My theory on life has always been modeled after the ninja.  With stealth 
and silence, you can remain 'alive' and still achieve what you want.

     It was already demonstrated to us through `boxing' that a little 
knowledge in the wrong hands can ruin a good thing.  Boxing was ruined because 
a lot of college kids found out about it, and abused it.

     As always, I stress again - keep the newbies informed that silence can be 
golden.  If you don't, we may be spending a lot more time relating to another 
type of metal...  metal bars.

____________________________________________________________________________


     Any older `Elite' (such an overused word) that is worth his salt is very 
familiar with the procedure of being arrested, either through first-hand or 
vicarious experience.  What happens when it is your turn?  Best thing you can 
do is be prepared!

     Paranoia has always been my best friend.  I encrypt all my files and 
never keep large amounts of hard copy lying around.  A thousand sheets of 
printer paper is hard to get rid of!  Always be paranoid and prepared.

     When the particular agency [Hmm...] comes to your door, they may or may 
not knock.  It depends on your threat level as well as what you may have done.

     Speaking with people about the subject, as well as my own experience, 
shows that similar events occur - leading up to an arrest or `questioning.'  
They notice unusual vehicles parked outside their home or see certain people 
everywhere they go.  These are bad signs!  [Understatement...]  Also, one 
important fact:  not only can they tap phones, but they also have equipment 
that is so sensitive, they can tell which individual letters are typed on an 
electronic typewriter.  Invasion of Privacy?  Yes, but do you think law-
enforcers always follow the law?

     Then comes the typical visit.  A knock on the door and people asking to 
come in.  Be very polite with these people.  You don't want to give them an 
excuse to draw weapons.  Simply ask to see proof of identification and the 
search warrant.  The identification will tell you with whom you are dealing.  
The warrant will tell you why they are here and what they are allowed to take.  
Read the warrant very carefully.

     If they ask you any questions, simply state that you `cannot' answer any 
questions without a lawyer present.  If you stick with this, you won't 
complicate your case.

     It is usually best to stay out of their way while they are conducting 
their `search'.  Simply ask if you can sit down somewhere.  Attempting to 
obstruct their search can be dangerous.

     They will confiscate a lot of items during their search.  Make a polite 
request that all items being removed from your residence and/or office be 
catalogued.  Some things tend to get `lost' during these searches.

     You will be questioned and they will probably ask you to incriminate 
other people you may or may not know.  Do not believe any `deals' they offer 
you.  Words are just words.  They don't mean anything at all.  My philosophy 
has always been:  I have not been forced to do this, why should I cause 
trouble for others.  You have chosen to do whatever you may be in trouble for, 
so this is your game.

     Eventually, you will be assigned a lawyer.  The most important thing to 
remember through this, is that most lawyers don't know much about this area.  
You would have better luck if you were as mass-murderer.  So, what is the best 
course of action?  Inform your lawyer that he should contact the EFF 
(Electronic Frontiers Foundation) for case assistance.

     This information won't keep you free.  But, if you ARE arrested, this is, 
by far, the best course of action.  What else can you do?  Spend some time, 
now, studying your basic rights and what they are good for.

     Remember, as David Lightman always says, `There are two kinds of hackers 
- the famous and the free.'

Greensboro, South Carolina -

     A survey of female students at the University of North Carolina at 
Greensboro found that those who experienced rape situations as college 
freshmen were much more likely to have been victims of childhood sexual abuse.  
These women had a 239 percent greater chance of being targets of rape or 
attempted rape than other women.  Psychology professor Jaqueline White 
speculated that perhaps rapists sense vulnerability in women.

     A federal judge awarded $155,000 to a 38-year-old woman with AIDS who 
claimed she was a victim of absurd precautions while confined to a county jail 
on bad-check charges.  Jail officials isolated her in a five-cell forensic 
unit usually reserved for the mentally disturbed, forced her to wear rubber 
gloves when using the jail typewriter, denied her regular attendance at church 
services and plastered her belongings with red stickers to indicate she had 
AIDS.

     In the interest of maintaining a right to privacy, freedoms of press, 
assembly and speech, and other constitutional freedoms, a coalition called the 
Fully Informed Jury Association (FIJA) is working to resurrect the little-
known legal doctrine of jury veto power.  Under this doctrine, trial jurors 
can acquit a defendant, regardless of the submitted evidence, on the basis of 
a jury disagreement with the law itself.  America's founders considered this 
power to be the final check on government.  To this day, jurors legally retain 
the traditional power to vote according to conscience without fear of 
reprisal.  Without it, there would be the frightening possibility that the 
Bill of Rights could come to be prohibited by law.

     Unfortunately, judges routinely- and wrongly- tell jurors that they must 
follow the law as they explain it, so most people are not aware of their 
tremendous power.  The FIJA has been working to restore that knowledge for the 
past three years.  For more information, call 1-800-Tel-Jury

Los Angeles-

     Psychotherapy appears to have a remarkably high percentage of 
practitioners who suffered psychological, physical, or sexual abuse.  A study 
in the journal 'Professional Psychology: Research and Practice' found 70 
percent of the women and 30 percent of the men who work as clinical or 
counseling psychologists reported childhood sexual abuse, physical assault, or 
harassment.  "The most common slip that therapists make is to substitute the 
word 'parent' for 'patient,'"said Dr. Jesse Geller of Yale University. "It 
suggests that in some symbolic sense, many therapists go into the field to 
cure their parents, to undo how they were raised."

INTERNET!

     Whether you want to debate the fine points of genetic engineering with a 
fellow at Stamford, or contemplate the cultural value of "Beverly Hills 
90210," there's probably a place for it on Internet. This vast computer 
network, which links government, academic, business, and research computers 
around the world, used to be a private operation, available to us only through 
college computers.  Now, public systems as 'PSILink Basic' are providing 
access to this rich resource.

     Using PSILink Basic software and a local access number, you can access 
PSI from 167 cities throughout North America.  The software lets you send 
unlimited electronic mail to and from other networks and various on-line 
services, including America On-Line, AppleLink, Bitnet, Bix, GEnie, and MCI 
Mail.

     PSILink Basic also gives you reading and posting rights to Usenet, the 
largest distributed BBS in the world.  Usenet's 3,000-plus conferences discuss 
subjects ranging from Windows software to mud wrestling.

     Also, PSI's file transfer program, FTP, lets you download software and 
reference materials from hundreds of computers around the world.

     Although PSILink Basic simplifies Internet, it's not software for the 
faint of heart.  Sending E-Mail is simple, but the three step file downloading 
feature is more cumbersome and inconvenient.

     The good news about PSILink Basic is its price.  For a monthly flat fee 
of $29 (1200-2400 bps) or $39 (9600 bps), you get unlimited e-mail including 
the ability to send binary files, and you can download 50 MB of file and 50 MB 
of Usenet postings.

     The best deal is in the 34 U.S. cities where there are no connect 
charges.  Other cities pay from $2.50 to $6.00 an hour, depending on the time 
of day.

     There is also a one-time charge and registration fee of $19, and $1 per 
Megabyte charge for downloads above the monthly limit.

     PSI can be reached in Reston, VA at 1(800)827-7482 or (703)620-6651

     I have been on a big EFF kick recently and am organizing a little group 
locally. Maybe someday we will get the world into a much nicer, digital, state 
of affairs. Just thank god for people like you who have the drive and the 
ability to spread the information.  Please keep up the good work!

     Have you talked with EFF about maybe putting it on their ftp site, 
ftp.eff.org? That is a great way to distribute it.  I am sure that they would 
be interested. I don't know if you read 'Scream N *me*me' but in #3 they 
talked about this concept of the text file pirate. Someone who scans in 
documents and uses OCR, or just types them in raw.  I think that we can 
definitely use more people like that to spread the information. Information is 
my big thing. Spread all the information as far and wide as possible. So many 
people are scared of information, like some information can contain some 
inherent evil that will destroy them.

[Good point!  I am glad to see that readers are sending this out to others!  
Anyone who feels like spreading a bit of information that may or may not be 
what you think is `common knowledge' should do so.  Too many people miss 
things that are `right under their noses', either due to over-socialization, 
or lack of care.  The other media make no hype of these things we cover. They 
are too controlled by the government and the Establishment to expose the 
truth.  It's now up to nonregulated parties, like us, to show what's going 
on!]

     I felt that your issue [#4] was pretty good.  I haven't gotten all of the 
way through it yet, but it's pretty good.  One part I don't like though, that 
part about homosexuality.  I am in the armed forces and I don't want some 
queer bunking with me.  I mean, they can do what they want, but not to me!  I 
am a bit homophobic, I admit it...  but still I just don't like it.

     I really liked the Dead Kennedys lyrics and the Chemical of the month.  I 
am glad that someone finally put something out on the safety aspect of the 
whole thing.  I am taking my time with it, because I'm not really sure when 
the next one is coming out, know what I mean?

     One more thing, Is all that stuff really true?  I mean, it's really 
interesting and it grabs your attention, but can all of that stuff be true?

[I think you're misunderstanding both the purpose of this magazine and the 
article on the passage of Amendment 2 in Colorado.  We are not a homosexual 
support group.  We're not a hate group, either.

     Laws were previously passed in several cities (eg, Denver, Boulder, and  
Aspen) in Colorado.  These laws increased the breadth of the Age, Sex, Race, 
Religion, and other freedoms we all have to include sexual preference.  With 
the passage of Amendment 2, all laws dealing with homosexuality were repealed 
and prevented institution of such laws in all remaining cities.  That meant 
that housing, employment, loans, anything can be denied or revoked on the 
basis of, specifically, homosexuality.  It is still illegal, in those cities, 
to deny heterosexuals anything based on THEIR sexual preference.

     The point is, when they strip ONE person of their rights, that allows 
precedent to strip another, and then another.  When it's okay to hate so-and-
so's, when will the next so-and-so be US?  If we can sit back and watch as 
others are denied their god-given rights, there is something wrong.  The right 
to do whatever one desires to fulfill one's life, not harming others, is 
guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.

     If you don't want to get jammed by some faggot - mention you're straight.  
If that doesn't work, as I know, sometimes it doesn't- Avoid that person.  
Just imagine how it would be if you were a girl being hunted down by some guy.  
He wants you, but you don't want him.  What's left??

     You don't have to go fag-bashing for a month and a half to recuperate 
your masculinity.  If your masculinity is THAT precarious, maybe you should 
see a professional.  Being trapped behind a computer, multimeter, and 
oscilloscope for 14+ hours a day, really changes one's perspective on 
'masculinity' and the need to have Freudian extensions of one's penis all 
around.]

Addendum:

     We're currently accepting donations of ANY size towards our 'Strecker 
Memorandum' fund.  This video is mentioned in issue #4.  So far, all costs 
incurred have come straight out of our collective wallet (mostly my collective 
wallet).  This is a field test to determine the response of this plea.  The 
video is to be bought and reviewed in an upcoming issue.  As we don't have a 
specific mailing address set up just yet, get in touch with me, and we'll work 
something out.

     We've just received information from the IRS on how to turn one's 
organization into a tax-exempt organization with tax-deductible donations.  
The organization must be incorporated, it would seem.  That, in itself, is 
going to run in the $200-$300 range, what with lawyer's fees and all.  More on 
this as the news happens.

     Thanks to Storm for the wonderful bunny slippers this Christmas!  If 
you've ever seen `Real Genius', they are JUST like those...  I love them.

     Other than that, nothing to report this issue,  we've been trying harder 
to make sure these things come out right the first time!

NOTE! on distribution of this publication:

     Issues 1 & 4 have been circulating quite a bit around a few areas and on 
Internet. [eg. England, Germany, Australia]  Hopefully, you will find this on 
EFF's FTP server.  If you find our articles of interest then please pass this 
publication around in your local area, as well as anywhere on any Net you can.  
Writing us a letter via Internet will almost assure future issues are sent 
directly to you.  We realize that there are many places on Internet we cannot 
reach or simply don't know about (please send all mail-serv's and ftp sites to 
us) and that's where you can help.

     This is a not-for-profit publication.  We are getting copies out by E-
mail, postal mail, and file transfer.  We cannot spare the time to call 
everywhere though.  So we are trying to work out places that this publication 
can ALWAYS be found.  If you're interested in carrying it, let us know, we'll 
be more than happy to work something out.

     We have had several hundred `published' copies distributed through the 
land-based underground.  It is still not available for subscription yet, but 
we will soon have the 'zine available for subscribers.  You may find a couple 
copies wandering around alternative clubs nationwide as well as passed around 
from sk8r to sk8r, Sharp to Sharp, patriot to patriot, etc...  Soon, we will 
have a (postal) mailbox sent up to receive letters from our land-based readers 
and also subscription info.

     Things can only get more interesting!
