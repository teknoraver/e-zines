     Well, as time has passed, we have met quite a number of unusual people.
We  have also seen quite an increase in the comments we've been getting from
just  about  everywhere.    Plus, we've  started  getting  more  promises of
articles.  So. now I think I should re-affirm our views.

      We are a free-form publication that exists to express the views of our
staff  as well as others who submit  articles, news, feedback, etc.  We just
like  to show different views from all walks of life.  Maybe some of it will
interest  you, maybe some won't.  It also  may affect you to hear it.  Plus,
it  helps carry the other  messages that we are trying  to drive home to the
maximum audience.

     We  have also  expanded our media  to include  a paper-form newsletter.
This  began with issue  #4 and we  have retro-edited #1  to fit this format.
Now  we are looking for carriers for it.  So, if you ask, we will send it to
you.  (It's identical to  the digital version.)   You can  pass this printed
version  on to your favorite bookseller or press.  That way we'll be able to
make each issue easily available.

     Like  I said, plenty  of changes this  year.  We  Are listening to you!
One  thing  we are  trying  to maintain,  though,  is the  element  of FACT!
Sometimes  we make mistakes (as can anyone)  but for the most part we always
try  to  insure that  doubtful things  are checked  out.   If  we DO  make a
mistake,  we're not afraid  to admit it.   If you  know that something we've
published  is incorrect, let us  know.  We'll be  sure to announce our error
and  clear up a possibly  confusing situation.  Also,  we added a disclaimer
that  will be featured in each and  every issue just to cover ourselves from
any potential blame from articles featured in Phirst Amendment.

     I  have many articles in the works. As  soon as I get home I will begin
adding  them.  I also plan on putting some of my previously written articles
in  this magazine.   That includes such things  as my text  on how to create
havoc  in  your school,  malls, businesses,  and other  such fun  places, my
acronym database, my articles on extreme damage and other things like that.

     Thanks for reading.  I hope we keep you entertained.

     We  got together, knowing we had to  do something about what's going on
in  our society today.  We'd all rebuked the ideas force-fed us, but NOW was
the time to do something.  We needed a common-ground.

    "Arizona's  a nice place,  lots of hip  people around, maybe  we can get
some assistance in this matter, there", mentioned Daiv.

    "Who the hell's gonna pay it?" queried Anesthesia.

    "I  will.   We can get  part time  jobs to pay  major bills,  and use my
savings for whatever else comes up," said Daiv nonchalantly.

    "Okay, as long as you're footing the bill", chimed Storm (Storm chimes a
lot.)

     So they loaded up the truck and moved to Phoenix...  Arizona, that is -
sand dunes, bumper cars...  <Banjo solo>

     Anyway,  we've overdone our stay here.  We've devised a link to keep us
in  touch as we part.  All authors that were flown in, were flown back home.
The  phone lines are disconnected.  The apartment is empty.  And we even got
most of our deposit back.

     We're  moving  to  an island  nation  far  from the  motherland.   It's
location  isn't important, but hopefully, everything  will work out right at
that distance.

     One thing I WOULD like to mention, though:  I'd really like to get more
articles  from the readers of  this publication.  At  least let us know your
perspective  on what we're doing.   If you like it, tell  us!  It gets kinda
hard thinking that there are only 20+ people who care, of the thousands that
read this mag.

     Next issue, we WILL have a mailing address for U.S. (SNAIL) mail.  Feel
free  to send donations, subscription fees, etc.   The printed copies end up
costing  approximately $1.50 with first-class postage and all.  The research
for  each issue can cost  between $100 to $750 depending  on whom we fly in,
whom  we interview, what books we buy, etc.  So, as you can see, any support
is useful, and all support is welcome.

[I've enjoyed Devo quite a bit and for some time.  I can appreciate the work
involved  in their music.  I have this  tendency to overlook  lyrics.  Since
we've  started this column, I've learned  to appreciate the political candor
of  so many lyricists.   This song, as are so  many, is representative of MY
point of view, and how I feel about this publication and our goals.]

                             **  CO2 Bomb  **

     Empty  CO2 cartridges  can be  used as  mini-bombs or  grenades, either
singly  or in groups;  possibly attached to  a central pipe  bomb or grenade
device.

     A  3/16" diameter  hole is  drilled into the  neck of  the cartridge. A
small  funnel is  used to fill  the bomb  with black or  smokeless powder. A
section  of 3/16" diameter cannon and hobby fuse is now glued into the hole.
Be sure to cut the ends at a diagonal; this will insure positive ignition of
the  powder.  If a  fragmentation effect is most  desirable to your cause, a
layer  of finish nails,  or even tacks, can  be taped to  the outside of the
cartridge.  The nails may be dipped in the toxin of your choice.

     A  fragmentation  device with  a greater  blast-radius  can be  made by
taping   several of these small bombs to a central pipe bomb or grenade. The
fuses  of the individual bombs  are trimmed to the  same length and the ends
are to be held together, loosely, with a rubber band.  These fuses should be
set  to burn for several  seconds [at LEAST!] than  the main bomb or grenade
fuse.   When  the main  bomb explodes, the  mini-bombs will,  in turn, spray
their respective areas with shrapnel.  [The fuse rate will be accelerated by
the heat caused from the blast, burning 2-10 times as fast as it does during
standard situations.]

     The  fuse should always be tested  before use to determine the specific
burning  rate.  Each new roll of fuse  should be tested, as the burning rate
may  vary from one roll to another.   Also, depending on if you have a large
spool  or small bobbin of fuse,  the inner-most layers of fuse may have been
compressed  and/or  had some  of  their flammable  powder  removed.   In any
combination  of these  cases, the burn  rate can vary  as much as  25%.  The
better the fuse (like you're going to `easily' come across REALLY good fuse)
the less likely this phenomenon is likely to occur.
[Thanks  go to  Dr. 8ball  for his  recommendation and  `submission' of this
pseudo-letter.   It  was included in  an album by  Jane's Addiction entitled
Ritual  de lo Habitual.   It is included  to create a  feeling of 'not being
alone'  in  this matter.   It  has the  potential to  stimulate some  of the
younger  (school-aged)  readers, who  may not  see the  scope of  the crimes
committed  against us,  into action.   Also, parents, please  learn from the
mistakes of YOUR parents.  Don't do the same things to your children!]

To The Mosquitoes,

     We have more influence over your children than you do, but we love your
children.   Most of you love them too,  very much.  You want what's best for
them.   Consider them when planning the  future, right?  Oh, Mother, Father,
your  blindness  to our  most blessed  gift -  NATURE -  leaves us  with the
overwhelming  task of correcting your  utter mess.  It  also proves that you
are  no judge of art, nor of beauty.   We learn from you how to become ideal
adults?   There are  subjects that you passed  over.  Or  maybe they are too
painful to speak about?

     Nature and Art - What could be more breathtaking?

     I used to wish sometimes that I was a black man.  I listened to the way
black  men spoke when  they spoke about freedom,  justice, and human rights.
And  in the way they spoke, I was sure they were speaking the truth.  At the
same  time, there was  a faint buzz,  spreading to all  of us the suggestion
that  the black man was not  to be treated equally.   For this, I envied the
black  man because it gave him  a passion for his living  and a cause to die
for.

     Would  you  have  ever imagined  there  would be  children  swinging in
polluted playgrounds?

     Do  you have children?   Do you see  yourself in them yet?   Do they do
whatever you tell them, or do they question authority?  Do you take the time
to  explain things to them, or Do you  blame the rest of the world for their
mistakes?

     I  used to  wish sometimes that  I was  a woman.   A woman  is the most
attractive  creature nature  has to offer  a man.   Why, then, is  it such a
shame to see her unclothed?  I feel more shame about a man watching a Quick-
Mart  being built.  How complementary a woman  is to a man!  Their giving of
love  is fearless.  Nature did right in tying the infant to the female.  Yet
they  also carry a sense  of sadness.  Quite  like the premonition of danger
they  hide but  can't shake  from their  minds.   I understand  they want to
protect their children, but for their own good, let me point out that though
you  may have  to explain  subjects to  your children  that you  perceive as
wrong, it is better to have the freedom to explain it in your own words than
to  be silenced under a  government that has the  power to squash anyone who
opposes their views.  It may one day evolve to be your child: that stands as
opposition,   who opposes the faint buzz that suggested to us all that women
are beneath men.  That was not always the case.

     Try  to restrict  our freedoms,  and we  will fight  harder to preserve
them.

     Mothers  and Fathers, Grandmothers  and Fathers, Great-Grandmothers and
Fathers,  Great-Great-Grandmothers and Fathers, you are responsible for more
destruction  to  this  planet that  in  all of  mankind's  history combined.
You've invented weapons capable of destroying every forms of wild animal and
vegetation.   I am  not sure what  condition the world  we are inheriting is
really in.  I just have a fear of smokestacks, and I don't trust the men who
feed their flames.

     The  paper these words [were] written  on also contain[ed] the music of
Jane's  Addiction.  The music is original, the  cover is not.  [The cover is
the Parental Advisory - This album contains explicit lyrics logo.  I believe
the  word `Fuck' is used once or twice... in the WHOLE album!]  The original
cover  is as colorful  as the music.   It is  a daydream of  the music, made
tangible.   It will take effort to get,  it is being sold, but we are having
difficulties.   There  is an  invisible force, the  same one  you have heard
faintly buzzing your entire life.  This time it buzzes much louder. I myself
have  felt its pain.  When  I looked down a the spot  where it hurt, I saw a
very  small  mosquito.   A bug  so old,  it  was known  to Confucius  as the
"Intellectual Mosquito."  He sucks off of you and he sucks off of me.

     Sometimes  to realize you  were well, someone must  come along and hurt
you.

     I  have grown to become proud of myself.  I have aligned with all those
who  have  been stung  by suppression.   As  heirs to  this planet,  we must
maintain,  honor,  and  enjoy  the  Gift of  Freedom.  A  cause  to validate
everyone's life?  Indeed.

     The world looks at America because WE are the beautiful!

     Their  newsletter is `Computer Virus Developmental Quarterly.'  It is a

offer  many disassemblies of current viruses.   All seem very well commented
to  help even beginning  programmers understand how viruses  work and how to
look for them.

like  to see  featured in  this section.   This  time, it  is left  short on
purpose-  I have many great things planned  for it.  These plans will evolve

[I  find a lot of static down military  lines, when I squeeze my sources for

figure,  "If it  doesn't pass Congress,  it won't  be law!"   That's not the
case.   There have been  many precedents of executive  orders allowing a law
that would NOT pass to become just as binding.  Clinton knows this avenue is
effective.  Here's how it works...]

     Let's  eyeball the executive  branch of the  national government.  This
will  be a beauty!  Caesar is alive  and well in Washington, D.C. You better
believe it.

     Earlier   mention was made of executive orders.  Our research shows the
first  use of these orders was  by President George Washington for household
expenses.   It was an order signed by him for normal expenses which would be
accepted by the Treasury Department and paid.  Simple enough.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation was formed under an executive order
by Teddy Roosevelt on July 26, 1908.

     The  first time  it was  used to make  a law  was in  1916 by President
Woodrow  Wilson.  It was said to  be an 'emergency' measure and Congress was
encouraged to validate it.  They did.

     The door was now open to ignore the Constitution.

     This is the same method used by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 to close all
the  banks in the  country.  Remember  our gold?   Americans were ordered to
turn in all their gold to local banks.  AFTER this was done, King Roosevelt,
by  executive order,  raised the value  of an  ounce of gold  from $20.00 to
$35.00!  Guess who that benefitted?  International bankers and central banks
around the world... that's who.

     Americans who turned in their gold were royally screwed.

     What  are the duties of  the executive branch?  To  make laws or to see
that they are faithfully executed?

     Nothing  in our Constitution allows the president to pass a law or make
a law under any circumstances. Nor is there any suggestion that the Congress
can  delegate their law-making authority  to the executive branch, emergency
or no emergency!

     Yet they have done it and they continue to do it without any permission
in the Constitution or any amendment.

     How  do they ignore their oath  to uphold and support the constitution?
Why not ask them?

     Let's   explore  their  law  making  activities...  government  uses  a
publication  called the Federal Register where all regulations are published
daily.  (Regulations?  Where the hell did that come from?)  This publication
amounts  to more  than 70,000  pages a  year.   Here is  where the executive
orders are published.

     When  they appear, they remain in limbo for 30 days and the Congress or
any  citizen can write and object  to it.  70,000 pages  a year would take a
full-time  staff member of  each member of  the Congress to  watch and study
these 'regulations.'  Congress pays no attention to the Federal Register.

     At  the end of  the required thirty days,  all these regulations become
'law'  and have the full effect of law!  There are occasions where these are
challenged  in courts when they have affected some individual and a few have
been  overturned.  See how simple they have made  it?  Write it, put it in a
federal  publication and if  no one says anything  about it, it mysteriously
becomes law.

     All  sorts of regulations  from every division  of the executive branch
are  published in the Federal Register and this is where all the goodies are
listed.   If you doubt the 'laws'  in the Federal Register have teeth, write
the Government Printing Office and request a copy.

     What  happened to the  concept that only  the Congress can  make a law?
Did  you  say it  was OK  or was  there  an amendment  passed by  the people
allowing this to go on?

     Now  let's look  at some  of the  real dirty  work they  have done with
executive  orders... There are  over 12,000 laws  of this type  on the books
now.   Congress, when asked, does not even  know what they are.  This is our
law-making  body.   Part of  the government  that is  supposed to "establish
justice,  insure  domestic  tranquility,  provide  for  the  common defence,
promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty"... snicker,
snicker...

     This one is really scary... A blueprint for a dictatorship!

     Executive Order No. 11921 was published in the Federal Register in June
1976  and updated since.  This is the  master plan for tyranny and the death
of our Constitution.

     All  the President has  to do is  declare a national  emergency and big
brother  will or can take over every form of newspaper, radio and television
stations.   They will confiscate your CB's, weapons, tell you where to live,
work,  how much food you can have,  establish  rationing and price controls.
In  effect, they  can declare  martial law and  you will  not be  able to do
anything about it.  Neither can the Congress.

     Can you imagine a law like this on the books in this country?

     All  they are waiting for is a certain set of circumstances and someone
who wants to be a dictator and away we go.

     If  you  haven't  heard  or  read  about  Executive  Orders,  this  one
especially, let me break the bad news.  It's on the books.

     Most  bureaucrats  and their  egghead  lackeys, when  asked  about this
executive  order,  will say  it  only concerns  the  orderly control  of the
country if we have a nuclear attack.  This is a cock-eyed lie!

     The  opening words  of Executive  Order 11921  are blunt:  "WHEREAS our
national  security is  dependent upon  our ability  to assure  continuity of
government,  at every level,  in any national  emergency type situation that
might  conceivably  confront the  nation;   and  WHEREAS  effective national
preparedness planning to meet such an emergency, including a massive nuclear
attack..."

     Look  closely at the  words they are  using, "any national emergency...
including massive nuclear..." is clear.

     They  can  decide what  the emergency  is and  it does  NOT have  to be
nuclear attack.

     Congressional  investigators began to look  into this subject and found
470  special statutes which  can be invoked  by the President  in a declared
national  emergency.  Where the  hell did they find the  power for him to be
able to declare a national emergency?

     Senator Mathias testified before a House Judiciary committee in 1975:
    "Under  the  authority delegated  by these  statutes, the  President may
seize  property;  organize  and  control  the  means  of  production;  seize
commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and
control  all  transportation and  communication;  regulate the  operation of
private  enterprise; restrict travel; and in  a plethora of particular ways,
control the lives of all American citizens."

     This is only the frosting... Wait until we look at the real powers they
will have when they decide which day will be 'X-Day'.

     How  can this be?  From this  1975 testimony, Congress is aware of what
can be done yet they do nothing to control this power.  Are they all part of
this  'mutual admiration  society' in the  cesspool known  as Washington DC?
Most will probably tell you "I don't know this, so it must be false."  Where
did  we go wrong?   How did they assume this  power in absolute violation of
the Constitution and all the oaths they have taken before they took office?

     What  was it the President swore?   "That I will faithfully execute the
office  of the President  of the United States,  and will to  the best of my
ability,  preserve,  protect  and  defend  the  Constitution  of  the United
States."

     Is  this  preserving, protecting  and defending  the Constitution?   Is
their oath just a bunch of words to be recited when they take office?  If he
were  going  to do  what  his oath  requires,  why hasn't  a  president told
Congress to pass a law abolishing executive orders?  Why hasn't the Congress
simply  taken the  law-making ability away  from the president?   Why hasn't
Congress  assumed their duties as required  by the Constitution?  Looks like
we  have allowed things to  get away from us in  the last few years, doesn't
it?   What do our kids  have to look forward to  if we don't stop this horse
dung now?

     Let's  take a look at  some of the powers they  will assume if there is
"any national emergency, including nuclear attack":

                        Part 9-Department of Commerce

     Section  901. Resume  of Responsibilities.   The  Secretary of Commerce
shall  prepare national  emergency plans  and develop  preparedness programs
covering:

     (1)  The production and  distribution of all materials,  the use of all
production  facilities (except those  owned by, controlled  by, or under the
jurisdiction  of the Department of Defense or the Atomic Energy Commission),
the  control  of all  construction materials,  and  the furnishing  of basic
industrial services except those otherwise assigned, including:

     (a) Production and distribution of and use of facilities for petroleum,
solid fuels, gas, electric power and water;
     (b) Production, processing, distribution, and storage of food resources
and  the use  of food resource  facilities for  such production, processing,
distribution and storage;
     (c) Domestic distribution of farm equipment and fertilizer;
     (d)  Use of communications services and facilities, housing and lodging
facilities, and health, education, and welfare facilities;
     (e)  Production, and  related distribution,  of minerals  as defined in
Subsection  702(5), and source materials as defined in the Atomic Energy Act
of  1954, as amended; and the  construction and use of facilities designated
as within the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior;
     (f)  Distribution of items in the  supply systems of, or controlled by,
the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission;
     (g) Construction, use, and management of civil aviation facilities; and
     (h)  Construction,  use  and  management  of  highways,    streets, and
appurtenant structures; and
     (i) Domestic distribution of health resources.
     Scary?   Unbelievable?  You bet it is.   And this is on the books right
now just waiting for the moment to declare any type of national emergency.

     Do  you believe for a moment that  we will still be using our computers
with the freedom we enjoy today? <Chuckle...>

     Let's  just suppose there  were several major  bank failures and powers
that  be decided  that they  couldn't afford  any more  failures. A national
emergency  was called.  Under part 17 of the same executive order, they will
take over the complete supervision of all banks and banking operations... To
the  point that  they will  decide if  you can  take any  money out  of your
account.  They will demand to know what you will spend it for and decide how
much  you can have.  However,  if they do not have  enough funds to give the
full  amount, they can ration the funds.  If they figure you want your money
to hoard it, they can simply refuse to give it to you.  Cute?

     This  includes all banking facilities, so  don't feel safe just because
your  money is in a credit union.  They have everything covered!  Each check
they  honor for over $1000 will have  to have both sides photographed and of
course,  none of  these regulations will  apply to  any transactions between
banks.  Just who does this money belong to?

     Is  it still  the United  States?   Makes you  wonder... For  those who
dabble  in the  stock market, under  part 25  they will assume  the power to
close  the market, suspend  any redemption rights,   freeze prices of stocks
and  bonds.  Then  they  will  allow it  to  reopen  only  when  they decide
conditions permit and under their  complete control.

     Remember  when Roosevelt changed the value of an ounce of gold from $20
to $35?  Who benefitted then?  Not us.

     And  for you readers who own property and believe that property belongs
to  you, we  have a little  surprise.   Not if this  executive order becomes
effective.  You will own nothing then.  Here's what Part 22 of the Executive
Order has to say about that:

     (9)  National  industrial reserve  and machine  tool program.   Develop
plans  for the custody of the  Industrial plants and production equipment in
the  national industrial  reserve and assist  the Department  of Defense, in
collaboration  with the Department of Commerce,  in the development of plans
and  procedures for the disposition, emergency reactivation, and utilization
of  the  plants  and  equipment  of  this  reserve  in  the  custody  of the
Administrator.

     (10)  Excess and surplus real and personal property.  Develop plans and
emergency  operating procedures  for the  utilization of  excess and surplus
real  and personal  property by  Federal Government  agencies with emergency
assignments  or by State and local governmental units as directed, including
review  of the  property holdings of  Federal agencies which  do not possess
emergency  functions to determine the availability of property for emergency
use,  and  including the  disposal  of real  and  personal property  and the
rehabilitation of personal property.

     What  do they mean by excess property?  Will they tell you what of your
property  is excess?  Are these decisions meant to punish people who had the
foresight  to put away coins or  food for bad times?   If you have been wise
enough to sock these items away, please don't tell anyone.

     And  what is 'rehabilitation of personal property?'  If someone doesn't
like  the way you use your property, will  they take it from you and give it
to  someone else?   Rehabilitation is  'restoring to good  operation or good
management.'

     Are  these  powers  we  granted to  the  central  government  under the
Constitution?   Where  do they  get the idea  that they  can issue Executive
Orders and decide a certain day that the Constitution is dead?

     Did  you  notice that  the Department  of Commerce  will take  over all
housing  and lodging facilities,  does that mean  your home also?   Maybe it
also needs rehabilitation?

     They   will  assume  control  of  all  health,  education  and  welfare
facilities.   You'd better  believe it will include  all schools, public and
private,  elementary and secondary.  There will be no arguments about school
prayer or momentary silence anymore.  The decision will be made for us.

     The implications are staggering. This is a blueprint for a dictatorship
and slavery.  No, I haven't been smoking loco weed... this is for real.

     Plans  are all set  "to assist civilian  educational institutions, both
public  and private, to adjust to demands  laid on them by a large expansion
of government activities during any type of emergency.  This includes advice
and  assistance to  schools, colleges,  universities, and  other educational
institutions  whose facilities may be temporarily needed for Federal, State,
or local programs in an emergency."

     Wonder  what they mean by "adjust to  demands laid upon them by a large
expansion  of  government  activities?"   Again  notice  the  special words:
"during  any type  of emergency."   They  didn't even  mention major nuclear
attack.

     Since  "large expansion  of government  activities" is  not defined, do
they have any limitation?  All this is in store for American citizens.

     They  have established what they call the 'Federal Preparedness Agency'
under  the General Services  Administration which has  the responsibility to
see that this program is carried out. We should keep our eye on the GSA.

     Better  yet, get  after Congress to  get this law  making ability taken
away from the executive branch of government.

     This  program of executive  orders is the most  dangerous weapon in the
hands  of government designed to make us all  slaves.  If "X" day is called,
America  will be no more  and we will be powerless  to do anything about it.
Our action has to be NOW. Waiting one day too long will be one day too late.

     Many will not believe this could happen in our country.

     Write  Congress and raise questions about this.  Ask how they delegated
their law making powers to the executive branch.

     Ask  where they found this authority.   Ask your Congressman for a copy
of this particular executive order.

     Imagine  12,000 laws of  this type on  the books at  the present... All
without  any authority from us.  And of course, no need to tell the American
people about these, they wouldn't understand them anyway.

     Is  this part of the glory of the position in government?  Congress has
delegated  emergency powers  to the  president... Congress  has no  power or
right  to delegate any of their powers.  Nowhere in our Constitution does it
say anything about giving 'emergency powers to the president'.

     The  argument goes that  in today's world, time  could be important and
the  president has to be able  to act quickly.  It  may be true, however, it
cannot  be in  this country  with out  a grant  for that  authority from the
people.

     No  where does the right appear to do any thing in case of a mistake or
an  emergency.  The  procedures are well defined  and it is  our duty to see
that they are observed.  There is no other way in America!
     If  they feel  granting emergency  powers is  so important,  propose an
amendment  to the Constitution and  see if we will  agree to the importance.
Of  course the amendment procedure is slow  and cumbersome.  It was meant to
be  that  way.   We  have ordained  and  established the  authority  for our
government and only we can agree to changes.

     Just  because a practice has been used  for a long period does not make
it  right.  If the practice was  unconstitutional when it began, it is still
unconstitutional.

     George  Washington wrote  in his  Farewell Address:  "The basis  of our
political  systems  is the  right  of the  people  to make  and  alter their
constitutions  of government.  But the constitution which at the time exists
till  changed  by an  explicit  and authentic  act  of the  whole  people is
sacredly obligatory upon all."

     He  plainly recognized  the basis  for our  government.   When did this
change occur?  It has been said that tyranny comes on slowly.  Before anyone
realizes it, it's present. Is that what we have today?

     Is  this the vehicle to make our  sovereignty disappear and for the USA
to become a full-fledged member of the United Nations under [the Republican]
New World Order?

     Here  we go again, a trip into the world  of grey.  Where what may be -
sometimes  is, and what  should be - seldom  is.  Poetic,  eh?  Anyway, this
time  I've decided to  go in a different  direction.  We  are going to cover
money -  plain and simple.  How to spend it and make it at the same time.

                               Credit Cards:
                               Use and Abuse

     Credit is excellent.  It is a tool to get what you would like to have a
few  months later - NOW!   It can also get you in a shit-load of trouble. If
one,  say, puts a new  stereo on Visa, gets married,  buys a new car, house,
wedding  bands, etc.   Then -  depression hits!   She hates him  and wants a
divorce,  he has  a breakdown  and can't  hold a  job for  a couple years...
Blammo!  The Credit Report from Hell in 3D!

     Here's  how to take these harmless  looking little things and make them
HELP you:

     A. Buy only the things that you would normally buy... just a little
           sooner and with someone else's money!
     B. Establish a budget, of sorts.  Essentially, figure out how much and
           how often you will buy things.
     C. Use this budget to determine what amount you should spend/charge on
           which items.

     When looking for a credit card, look for $0!  Yes, ZERO dollars, annual
fee.    The interest  rate is  of  no concern  at this  time.   The  two are
generally  mutually exclusive.   There are  other uses for  credit cards for
which  the interest rate is of great concern;   this is NOT one of them.  So
if  you have  a choice between  a high yearly  fee with low  interest and no
annual  fee with  high interest...  opt for  NO fee.   Also,  look for grace
periods on purchases.  That is, a long amount of time for the bill to arrive
and have no interest charged on your purchases.

     If  one would budget, say, $1000 for a stereo system, but wouldn't have
that  amount for two  months, NO PROBLEM!   Buy it at  the beginning of your
billing cycle.  It wouldn't have to be paid for two months.  Some banks have
a grace period will give you 25 days from your billing date and then another
30  days to pay the bill after they send it to you.  So that's two months to
save up the money for that stereo.

     PAY  THE BILL EXACTLY WHEN IT IS DUE!  Not sooner - not later.  Sooner,
and  you are wasting the opportunity to  earn interest from your money while
it  sits in your savings/investment account.  Later, and you are paying your
credit card company 1.75% per month to let you buy things.

     So  after keeping that additional $1000 in your savings account earning
6%  (what mine earns as  of April 1993) per year,  you will have made $10.03
(over  1%) after two months.   When interest rates  rise, as they always do,
this  process is  much more lucrative.   Discover is  bragging about getting
cash  back (up  to a  whopping (sic) 1%!!)  based on  your annual purchases.
This can be done with ANY bank card.  This is the ONE situation which exists
where  the more one spends, the more one  saves.  One can buy groceries, car
parts,  computer parts, books, everything  imaginable on Visa or MasterCard.
That sure beats spending $210/year for $1000 worth of credit!

     Another  thing one can  do is to receive  'cash back' without incurring
the  interest!   Generally, bank cards  charge interest from  the MOMENT the
cash  is received,  but give a  grace period  on purchases:   Buy things for
friends.   When  out shopping  with friends, and  someone wants  to buy some
stupid crap with cash...  have him/her give YOU the money and put it on your
charge.

     Even  though Visa charges businesses  4-7% per transaction, some places
are  willing to give cash  back when presented an  item for return without a
receipt.   I am  not suggesting shoplifting!   But if you  bought it on your
credit  card and return it...  You now  have the cash they gave you to spend
however you wish.  Some places don't take credit cards - they don't have to,
you  now have cash!  It could be put in savings and earn interest.  You will
make money off of money you never had in the first place!

     In  legal-ese, it would  be reaching, but  somewhat applicable, to call
this  'floating.'   I'll  get to  how that  works  in a  bit.   But floating
interest-free  credit is not QUITE the same  or as illegal as floating CASH.
Although,  banks  and lending  institutions  (the system)  would  prefer you
didn't know how or decide to do this.  Regardless, each business that honors
a credit card for payment pays up to 7% (depending on the card, and how much
business they do) for the luxury of allowing customers to use that card.

     All of these activities will assist you in generating a positive credit
report.  Credit reporting agencies don't care  how much you pay in interest,
only  in how much you buy on credit.  So, by buying tons of crap, and paying
$0.00  in interest, your report  will be chock full of  credit!  This can be
helpful  for some of the hints that I will give in later issues.  A positive
credit report can be used to generate tons o' bucks.

|                  Editorial on Unfair Transportation Acts                 |
|                              by Bob White                                |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     There  are  many ways  the U.S.  government robs  it own  citizens. The
following  is only an  example of the  thousands of ways  that decent, hard-
working Americans are stripped of their rights every day.

     The  rights being violated  here, are those of  truck drivers who drive
semis  cross-country.   If you  are not  a trucker,  you may  not think this
article pertains to you - it pertains to you more than you may think.

     Truck  drivers, as soon as they cross a state line, have to stop at the
nearest  port of entry or weigh station.   Here they have to pay large fines
to  buy trip  and fuel permits.   Yes!   they have  to pay just  to drive on
public  roads and  even pay  to carry fuel  in their  tanks.   They are also
searched  and  have  their log  books  looked through,  and  ANY discrepancy
results  in a  citation with  a heavy  fine.   These are  usually from petty
things that violate one of millions of obscure statutory laws.

     A  friend  of mine  has  experienced this  first  hand.   While driving
through  the Midwest,  his truck  was searched  for over  three hours  by an
obnoxious  woman who was determined to give  him a ticket.  She finally did.
The  reason for the citation was explained  as "having a loose projectile in
the cab".  That loose projectile was a pencil on the dash.

     I  bring this up because  I feel these fines  and permits DO go against
the Constitution:  Section 8 of Article 1 clearly states:

    "No  preference shall be given by  any regulation of commerce or revenue
to  the ports of one state over those of another: NOR SHALL VESSELS BE BOUND
TO; OR FROM ONE STATE BE OBLIGED TO ENTER, CLEAR, OR PAY DUTIES IN ANOTHER."
[Emphasis added]

     If you throw this at them, they just laugh at you like the constitution
is  meaningless.    This  is  due  to  a  criminal  organization  called the
Department  of Transportation.   It has assumed  legislative, executive, and
judicial  powers that it cannot legally have.  By overriding Article 1, they
are violating Amendment 14, Section 1, which states:

    "No  state  shall  make  or  enforce any  law  which  shall  abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."

     Driving  on public  roads is  not a privilege  of citizens,  as the DMV
would have you believe, but it IS a constitutionally guaranteed right.  This
could  even  suggest that  paying for  licenses or  having them  revoked for
misdemeanors  is unlawful. (I DO believe that dangerous drivers (eg. Drunken
Drivers) should have their privileges revoked.)

     This  is  another aspect  to look  at.   Sure,  it's terrible  that the
government  is giving truckers the shaft.  But who really pays for all those
fines?   They put many hard-working individuals out of the industry.  [Maybe
THAT'S  why there are all those ads  for Trucker Schools...-Daiv]  My father
is only one of the thousands of casualties of this conflict.  People who own
small  trucking outfits can barely  make a living, if they  can at all.  But
large  companies just absorb these fines  as 'transportation costs' that end
up  on the price tags of shipped items.  That means that you and I, the good
ol' American consumers, are the ones who pay for these activities.

     The  DOT says they have to have  these fines in order to raise revenue.
My  question is "FOR WHAT?"   Someday, I would like  to meet someone who can
honestly  say he's seen them FIX the  roads.  [What about the additional 25+
cents  per gallon  of gas  paid as  'transportation tax'  that Americans are
sheltered  from having to see - as all  prices are 'tax included'?]  Look at
the  ancient Roman  roads made  of concrete  - they  are still  there and in
pretty  good shape.  But THAT would destroy a lot of government jobs and end
a  lot of deadlock in the state capitols,  and you KNOW they cannot let THAT
happen.  The individuals involved would never approve of a measure that gets
them fired, no matter HOW much it would help the rest of the country/state.

     If  you are at all  offended by this or  any other government snow-job,
then  it is time  to start taking action.   We, as  Americans, need to begin
standing up for our rights before Washington takes them all away.  Do NOT be
fooled  into believing that you cannot fight  the system.  They are supposed
to  be YOUR servants [civil servants... I've heard of them...] NOT the other
way  around.  If Daiv is interested, I would like to do a report on a subtle
way  to fight Uncle Sam.   It is a method  known as 'tacit procuration' [the
act  of obtaining silently]  and is VERY  effective when done  properly.  It
will take a while to gather the references, so that may end up being several
issues down the road.

     If  you would like  to know more  about the statutes  that truckers are
fined  for, I recommend you go out to  an Amoco on the interstate and strike
up  a conversation with a trucker.  Ask  them what they think about the DOT.
You are bound to get some very colorful responses.

     The  following kit is  an invaluable resource for  those wanting to pry
out  information from our wonderfully secretive  government.  Ever wanted to
know what 'files' the Government has on YOU??  Or what files the NSA/DIA/CIA
may  have on UFOs, the JFK assassination, Nugan-Hand, BCCI and other lies of

                           <1> FOIA Instructions
                    USING THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT

     The  Freedom  of Information  Act entitles  you  to request  any record
maintained  by a federal  Executive branch agency.   The agency must release
the  requested material unless it falls  into one of nine exempt categories,
such  as "national security", "privacy", "confidential source" and the like,
in  which case the agency may but is not compelled to refuse to disclose the
records.    This article  contains  all the  materials  needed to  make FOIA
requests  for records on  an individual, an organization  or on a particular
subject matter or event.

                                INSTRUCTIONS
                       HOW TO MAKE A COMPLETE REQUEST

Step  1: Select and make copies of the sample letter.  Fill in the blanks in
the  body of the letter.  Read the directions printed to the right margin of
the  letter in conjunction  with the following  instructions: For individual
files:  Insert  the person's  full name  in  the first  blank space  and any
variations  in spelling, nicknames, stage  names, marriage names, titles and
the  like in the second space.   Unlike other requests, the signatures of an
individual   requesting   her/his  own   file  must   be  notarized.     For
organizational  files:  In the first blank  space insert the full and formal
name  of the organization  whose files you  are  requesting.   In the second
blank  space,  insert any other names,  acronyms or shortened forms by which
the  organization is  or has   ever been known  or referred to  by itself or
others.   If some of the organization's work is conducted by sub-groups such
as  clubs, committees, special programs or through coalitions known by other
names,  these should be listed.  There  is no need to notarize signature for
organizational  requests.  For  subject matter or event  files: In the first
blank  space state the formal title of the subject matter or event including
relevant  dates and locations.  In the  second blank space provide the names
of   individuals  or  group  sponsors   or  participants  and/or  any  other
information  that would assist  the agency in locating  the material you are
requesting.

Step  2: The completed sample letter  may be removed, photocopied and mailed
as  is or retyped on  your own stationary.   Be sure to keep  a copy of each
letter.

Step  3: Addressing the  letters:  Consult  the list of  agency addresses on
section 5 of this kit.

FBI:  A complete request requires a minimum of two letters.  Send one letter
to  FBI Headquarters and  separate letters to each  FBI field office nearest
the   location  of   the  individual,   the  organization   or  the  subject
matter/event.    Consider the  location  of residences,  schools,  work, and
other activities.

INS:  Send a request letter to each  district office nearest the location of
the  individual, the organization or the subject matter/event.  Address each
letter  to the FOIA/PA  office of the  appropriate agency.   Be sure to mark
clearly on the envelope:  Attention FOIA Request.

                                    FEES

     In 1987, a new fee structure went into effect.  Each agency has new fee
regulations  for   search and  review time  and for  duplication of released
documents.   Commercial requesters  must pay for search  and review time and
for  duplication  costs.   News  Media representatives  and  Educational and
Scientific  Institutions whose  purpose is scholarly  or scientific research
pay  for duplication only.  Public Interest groups who can qualify as press,
educational,  or scientific  institutions will be  charged duplication costs
only.   All other non-commercial requesters are  entitled to up to 100 pages
of free copying and up to 2 hours of free search time.  Requesters will have
to  pay fees for work  that extends beyond those  limits unless they qualify
for  a fee waiver  or reduction (see below).   No fee may  be charged if the
cost  of collection exceeds the  fee.  Advanced payment  may not be demanded
unless  a requester has previously failed to  pay on time or the fee exceeds
$250.

                                 FEE WAIVER

     You  will notice that  the sample letter  includes a request  for a fee
waiver with instructions for the agency to refer to an attached sheet.  Fees
for  all non-commercial  requesters, beyond  the 2  hours/100 page/automatic
waiver   described above, may be waived  or reduced if the disclosure of the
information  is: in the  public interest because it  is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the
government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
You  should always request a  waiver or fees if  you believe the information
you  are seeking will benefit the public.  Read the fee waiver worksheet for
non-commercial  users included in this kit on page 5 for help in composing a
request  for a  fee waiver.   If your  request for  a waiver  is denied, you
should  appeal that denial, citing the ways in which your  request meets the
standards set in the attached fact sheet.

         HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING YOU ARE ENTITLED TO...
                        AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON'T

     After  each agency  has searched and  processed your  request, you will
receive   a  letter  that  announces  the  outcome,  encloses  the  released
documents,  if any, and explains where to  direct an appeal, if any material
has been withheld.  There are four possible outcomes:

1.  Request granted in full: This occurs very infrequently.  If the response
indicates  that  the  agency  has released  all  records  pertinent  to your
request,  with no exclusions or withholdings, you will receive the requested
documents  with an agency  cover letter, or  if bulky, the  documents may be
mailed under separate cover.

Next  step:  Check  documents for completeness  (see instructions below) and
make  an administrative  appeal if you  find a discrepancy  between your own
analysis and that of the agency (see instructions below).

2. Request granted in part and denied in part:  This response indicates that
the  agency  is  releasing some  material  but has  withheld  some documents
entirely or excised some passages from the documents released.  The released
documents may be enclosed or, if bulky, mailed under separate cover.

Next  step: Check  documents for  completeness (see  instructions below) and
make an administrative appeal of denials or incompleteness (see instructions
below).

3.  Request denied  in full:   This  response and  the denied  part response
indicate  that the agency is asserting that material in its files pertaining
to  your request  falls under one  of the  nine FOIA exemptions.   These are
categories  of information that the agency may, at its discretion, refuse to
release.

Next  step: Make an  administrative appeal (see  instructions below).  Since
FOIA  exemptions are not  mandatory, even a complete  denial of your request
can and should be appealed.

4.  No records: This response will state that a search of the agency's files
indicates that it has no records corresponding to those you requested.

Next  step: Check your original  request to be sure  you have not overlooked
anything.   If  you receive documents  from other agencies,  review them for
indications  that there is material  in the files of  the agency claiming it
has   none.    For  example,  look  for  correspondence,  or  references  to
correspondence,  to or from  that agency.   If you determine  that there are
reasonable grounds, file an administrative appeal (see instructions below).


                  HOW TO CHECK DOCUMENTS FOR COMPLETENESS

Step 1:
     Before  reading the  documents, turn them  over and number  the back of
each  page sequentially.  The packet may contain documents from the agency's
headquarters  as well as several field office files.  Separate the documents
into  their  respective office  packets.   Each of  these offices  will have
assigned  the  investigation  a  separate  file number.    Try  to  find the
numbering  system.   Usually the lower  right-hand corner of  the first page
carries  a  hand-written file  and document  number.   For instance,  an FBI
document  might be marked "100-7142-22."  This would indicate that it is the
22nd  document in the 7142nd file in the 100 classification.  As you inspect
the  documents, make  a list  of these  file numbers  and which  office they
represent.   In this way you will  be able to determine which office created
and  which office received the document you  have in your hand.  Often there
is  a block stamp affixed with the name  of the office from whose files this
copy  was retrieved.  The "To/From" heading  on a document may also give you
corresponding  file numbers and will  help you puzzle out  the origin of the
document.   When you have finally identified each document's file and serial
number and separated the documents into their proper office batches, make  a
list of all the serial numbers in each batch to see if there are any missing
numbers.   If there are missing serial  numbers and some documents have been
withheld,   try  to  determine  if  the  missing  numbers  might  reasonably
correspond  to the withheld  documents.  If  they don't, the  release may be
incomplete and an administrative appeal should be made.

Step 2:
     Read  all the documents released to you.   Keep a list of all documents
referred  to in the text, including letters, memos, teletypes, reports, etc.
Each  of these "referred to" documents should turn up in the packet released
to  you.  If any are not in the  packet, it is possible that  they are among
the  documents  withheld  and  a  direct inquiry  should  be  made.    In an
administrative  appeal, ask that  each of these "referred  to" documents  be
produced  or  that  the  agency  state plainly  that  they  are  among those
withheld.    List each  "referred to"  document separately.   The  totals of
unproduced  vs. withheld must be within reason; that is, if the total number
of  unproduced documents you find referred to  in the text of the  documents
produced  exceeds the total number of  documents withheld, the agency cannot
claim that all the "referred to" documents are accounted for by the withheld
category.   You will  soon get the  hang of making  logical conclusions from
discrepancies in totals and missing document numbers.  Another thing to look
for  when reading the released documents is the names of persons or agencies
to whom the document has been disseminated.  The lower left-hand corner is a
common  location  for the  typed list  of  agencies or  offices to  whom the
document  has  been  directed.    In  addition,  there  may    be additional
distribution recorded by hand, there or elsewhere, on the cover page.  There
are  published glossaries  for some agencies  that will  help in deciphering
these  notations when they  are not clear.   Contact FOIA,  Inc. if you need
assistance in deciphering the text.

     Finally,  any other file numbers that  appear on the document should be
noted, particularly if the subject of the file is of interest and is one you
have  not requested.  You  may   want to make an additional request for some
of these files.

                    HOW TO MAKE AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL

     Under   the   FOIA,  a   dissatisfied  requester   has  the   right  of
administrative  appeal.   The name and  address of the  proper appeal office
will be given to you by each agency in its final  response letter.  This kit
contains  a sample appeal letter with suggestions for adapting it to various
circumstances.   However,  you need  not make  such an  elaborate appeal; in
fact, you need not offer any reasons at all but rather simply write a letter
to  the appeals unit stating that "This letter constitutes an  appeal of the
agency's    decision."    Of  course,  if  you  have  identified  some  real
discrepancies, you should set them forth fully (for example see Step 2 under
"How  to Check Documents for Completeness"), but  even if you have not found
any,  you may  simply ask that  the release be  reviewed.  If  you are still
dissatisfied after the administrative appeal process, the FOIA gives you the
right to bring a lawsuit in federal district court.

                  MONITORING THE PROGRESS OF YOUR REQUEST

     You  should receive  a letter from  each agency within  10 days stating
that  your request  has been received  and is  being processed.   You may be
asked  to be patient since requests are  being handled on a first come first
served basis.  The best strategy is to be "reasonably" patient, but there is
no  reason to sit complacently and wait  for an interminable period of time.
A good strategy is to telephone the FOIA office in each agency after about a
month if you have received nothing of substance.  Ask for a progress report.
Note  the name of  the person you speak  to and what they  say.  Continue to
call  every 4 to 6  weeks.  Good record  keeping helps avoid  time-consuming
and frustrating confusion.   A loose-leaf notebook with a section devoted to
each request simplifies this task.  At the beginning of the request process,
sometimes  it is difficult to foresee what course of action you will want to
take  in the  future.  Keep  copies of  all correspondence to  and from each
agency.   They can be inserted between the  notes on phone calls so that all
relevant   material  will  be  at  hand  for  future  use,  including  phone
consultations,  correspondence,  newspaper articles,  preparation  for media
appearances, congressional testimony or litigation.

waiver  of any fees in excess of those which are provided free because of my
category.

My category for fee and fee waiver purposes is (check one):
o  request for personal file; no search fee and 100 free pages.
o  journalist, academic or scientist; no search fee and 100 free pages.
o  other non-commercial requester (group or person); 2 hours free search
   and 100 free pages.

     I  request a  complete and  thorough search  of all  filing systems and
locations  for all  records maintained by  your agency  pertaining to and/or
captioned:
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

including,  without  limitation,  files and  documents  captioned,  or whose
captions  include [describe  records desired  and/or insert  full and formal
name]
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________


     This  request specifically includes where  appropriate "main" files and
"see  references," including  but not limited  to numbered  and lettered sub
files  and  control  files.   I  also  request a  search  of  the Electronic
Surveillance  (ELSUR) Index, or any   similar technique for locating records
of  electronic surveillance  and the COINTELPRO  Index.  I  request that all
records be produced with the administrative pages.  I wish to be sent copies
of  "see reference" cards,  abstracts, search slips,  including search slips
used  to  process this  request, file  covers, multiple  copies of  the same
documents  if they appear  in a file, tapes  of any electronic surveillance,
photographs,  and  logs  of  physical surveillance  (FISUR).    Please place
missing  documents on "special locate."  I wish to make it clear that I want
all  records  in your  office "identifiable  with  my request,"  even though
reports  on those  records have  been sent  to Headquarters  and even though
there  may be duplication between the two sets of files.  I do not want just
"interim"  documents.   I want  all documents as  they appear  in the "main"
files and "see references" of all units of your agency.

     If  documents  are denied  in whole  or in  part, please  specify which
exemption(s)  is(are)  claimed for  each passage  or whole  document denied.
Give  the number  of pages in  each document  and the total  number of pages
pertaining  to this request and the dates  of documents withheld.  I request
that  excised material be "blacked out" rather  than "whited out" or cut out
and  that  the remaining  non-exempt portions  of  documents be  released as
provided under the Freedom of Information Act.
     Please  send a memo  (with a copy  or copies to  me) to the appropriate
unit(s) in your office to assure that no records related to this request are
destroyed.  Please advise of any destruction of records and include the date
of  and authority for such destruction.   As I expect to appeal any denials,
please specify the office and address to which an appeal should be directed.
I can be reached at the phone listed below.  Please  call  rather than write
if there are any questions or if you need additional information from me.  I
expect  a response to this request within ten (10) working days, as provided
for in the Freedom of Information Act.

[MARK CLEARLY ON ENVELOPE: FOI/PA REQUEST]
                            <3> FOIA Fee Waiver
             Fee Waiver Worksheet for Non-Commercial Requesters

     All  non-commercial requesters are  entitled to apply  for a fee waiver
for  charges  in  excess  of  those  which  are  provided  free  because  of
requester's category.  Following amendments to the FOIA in October 1986, the
Justice  Department  issued a  memo  outlining six  criteria  to be  used by
agencies  in  determining  whether  or  not  to  grant  fee  waivers.   Many
Congresspeople  dispute the memo's legality,  pointing out its invitation to
subjective   judgements,  and  its   proclivity  to  intimidate  requesters.
Nevertheless,  until the six criteria are  eliminated, either by Congress or
court  decisions, requesters will  have to address them  in order to qualify
for  a fee waiver.   To apply for  a fee waiver, attach  a separate sheet of
paper  to your request letter explaining  in narrative form how your request
satisfies each of the following six criteria.

(All  highlighted phrases in the following  text are taken directly from the
Justice Department memo):

(1)  Explain how the records you are  requesting are likely to shed light on
the operations or activities of the government.

(2)  Describe  how the  records you  are requesting  will contribute  to the
understanding  of government operations  or activities.   If the information
being  requested is not already in the  public domain bring this fact to the
agency's attention.

(3)a.  Explain to the agency how the public will ultimately benefit from the
information  you are  requesting.  Legislative  history and  recent case law
indicate  that the "public" is not limited to U.S. public nor must it be the
"public at-large."

     For example, Representatives English and Kindness jointly stated during
recent  Congressional  debate,    "Public   understanding  is  enhanced when
information  is  disclosed  to the  subset  of the  public  most interested,
concerned  or  affected by  a particular  action  or matter."   Furthermore,
District  Court Judge Harold Greene in a 1987 opinion involving a request by
a  Canadian newspaper said,  "There is no requirement  in the [FOIA] statute
that  news  media  seeking  fee waivers  [must]  serve  the  American public
exclusively,  or  even tangentially...  an FBI  official  does not  have the
authority to amend the law of the United States by restricting it beyond its
plain  terms."  In other words, the public you seek to educate does not have
to  reside in the United States, nor is  the size of that public relevant to
your entitlement to a fee waiver.

(3)b.   Explain  to  the  agency   your  qualifications  (educational,  work
experience,  etc.) for  understanding the requested  information and outline
your  ability and intention to disseminate  the information once it has been
obtained.   You  might want to cite any of the following activities in order
to  demonstrate your ability and intention to disseminate information to the
public:  writing newspaper  or scholarly  articles, writing  books, granting
interviews,  public speaking engagements, preparing Congressional testimony,
producing pamphlets, videos, film, radio programs, etc.

(4)   The Justice Department memo stipulates that the contribution to public
understanding  must  be  "significant."   What  constitutes  a "significant"
contribution  is clearly susceptible to subjective interpretation.  However,
we  suggest  that you  make reference  to current  news stories,  efforts to
correct  the historical  record or expose  government or  corporate fraud or
threats to public health and safety.  Broadly speaking, any information that
would  enable the public to  hold the government accountable  for any of its
operations  or activities can  be persuasively argued  to be a "significant"
contribution to public understanding.

(5)  and (6) Explain to  the agency (if it is  the case) that any commercial
interest  that will be furthered by the requested records is not the primary
interest  when compared  to the  public interest that  will be  served.  For
example,  if the information  is requested pursuant to  the publication of a
book,  you should explain (if it is the case) that this book is not destined
to become a bestseller because of topic, publisher, or anticipated audience,
etc.    News  media  representatives, scholars  or  scientists,  should make
requests  for  documents and  fee waivers  on the  appropriate institutional
letterhead.   Similarly, requests for organizational files should be made on
the  appropriate letterhead.   You  have a  right to  file an administrative
appeal if you receive an adverse decision regarding either your fee category
or fee waiver request.  The letter containing the adverse decision will tell
you to whom you should direct the appeal.
                              <4> FOIA Appeal
                    SAMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL LETTER

Date:
To: FOIA/PA Appeals Office
RE: Request number [Add this if the agency has given your request a number]
This  is  an  appeal  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)(6)  of  the  Freedom  of
Information Act as amended (5 U.S.C. 552).
On  [date],  I received  a letter  from  [name of  official] of  your agency
denying  my request  for [describe  briefly the  information you  are after]
This  reply indicated  that an  appeal letter could  be sent  to you.   I am
enclosing  a copy of my exchange of  correspondence with your agency so that
you  can  see exactly  what  files I  have  requested and  the insubstantial
grounds on  which my request has been denied.

[Insert following paragraph if the agency has withheld all or nearly all the
material which has been requested]

     You  will  note that  your agency  has withheld  the entire  (or nearly
entire)  document  that I  requested.   Since  the  FOIA provides  that "any
reasonably  segregable portion of  a record shall be  provided to any person
requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt,"
I  believe that your agency has not complied  with the FOIA.  I believe that
there  must be (additional) segregable portions which do not fall within the
FOIA exemptions and which must be released.

[Insert  following paragraph if the agency has used the (b)(1) exemption for
national security purposes to withhold information]

     Your agency has used the (b)(1) exemption to withhold information.

[I  question whether  files relating to  events that took  place over twenty
years ago  could  realistically  harm  the national security.]

[Because I am familiar with my own activities during the period in question,
and know that none of these activities in any way posed a significant threat
to the national security, I question the designation of my files or portions
of  my file as  classified and exempt  from disclosure   because of national
security considerations.]

[Sample optional arguments to be used if the exemption which is claimed does
not  seem to make sense;  you should cite as many specific instances as  you
care  to of items  withheld from the  documents that you  have received.  We
provide two examples which you might want to adapt to your own case.]

     "On  the  memo dated  ______ the  second  paragraph withheld  under the
(b)(1) exemption appears to be describing a conversation at an open meeting.
If  this  is  the  case,  it  is  impossible  that  the  substance  of  this
conversation  could be properly classified."

Or,
    "The  memo  dated ____  refers  to a  meeting  which I  attended,  but a
substantial   portion  is  deleted  because  of  the  (b)(6)  and  (b)(7)(c)
exemptions  for unwarranted invasions of personal  privacy.  Since I already
know  who  attended  this meeting,  no  privacy  interest is  served  by the
withholding."

     I trust that upon examination of my request, you will conclude that the
records  I  have requested  are not  properly  covered by  exemption(s) ____
[insert the exemption(s) which the agency's denial letter claimed applied to
your  request] of the amended FOIA, and  that you will overrule the decision
to withhold the information.

[Insert following paragraph if an itemized inventory was not supplied by the
agency]
     If you choose to continue to withhold some or all of the material which
was  denied in my initial request to your  agency, I ask that you give me an
index  of such material,  together with the justification  for the denial of
each  item  which  is  still  withheld.    As  provided  in  the  Freedom of

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     Way back in 1975, before many currently college-aged readers had a care
in  the world,  a woman  by the  name of  Francis Moore  Lappe wrote  a book
entitled 'Diet for a Small Planet.'  This book postulated concepts that many
wouldn't  consider, especially at that time, even now.  One concept was that
meat  is not  necessary for  survival.   In fact,  a diet  of meat  is anti-
survivalist.   This effect is  not only on the  personal level: getting sick
from  ingesting the hormones and toxins present in the animal at the time of
slaughter.   This  effect has gone  many steps beyond,  into world survival.
There  is simply not enough food, when wasted on slaughter stock production,
to feed our world, not even our nation.

     Until  February of  this year, the  USDA has  been illustrating dietary
guidelines  based  upon data  compiled in  the  50's.   The four  food group
concept  which placed wasteful meat as a priority has been known to be false
since  the 70's!  But special interest groups persisted and funded. Senators
and  representatives  know  the  magic of  $'Ch-ching'$  -  so  nothing ever
happened.   Well, too damn many people  got educated.  It's surprising, too,
considering  that  only  5% of  all  medical schools  have  prerequisites of
nutrition education and only 30% even offer minimal nutrition classes.

     Too  many people raised  their voices.   Too many people  refused to be
shut out by the grand bureaucracy.  And finally a CHANGE occurred!  The USDA
has  now instituted  the 'Food Pyramid'  means of  explaining dietary needs.
Just  like a pyramid, the  most important parts are  at the foundation, with
larger volume requirements.

                                Protein Group
                              Vegetables\Fruits
                          Breads, Grains, & Cereals

     Seems  pretty simple, doesn't it?  Eat 7-11 servings of the bottom, 4-7
servings  of the middle, and 2-3 servings  of the top.  The standard serving
size  has had to decrease, as there would be little time left in the day, if
one just ate all day.

     The  American Heart Association is telling people to eat only one 6 oz.
serving  of meat a  day, if you  MUST have meat.   This trend  is going in a
positive  direction.  Unfortunately,  parents are teaching  children the bad
habits  learned from the  previous generation.   This is going  to take some
time to fix, but it is on the way.

     If we all just followed the herd, nothing would have changed.  If no on
spoke  up, no one would learn.   It's time to change  not only the pace, but
the direction as well.

     We in America need more people who speak out.  We have been so subdued.
Televison has become the opiate of the masses.  Americans spend 'on average'
six  hours a day watching television.  That  leaves only two hours to give a
shit  after accounting for sleep  and work.  But that  time giving a shit is
spent concerned with health.

     The  government puts  fluoride in  our water,  which is  done in Soviet
prison  camps to tranquilize  prisoners.  The  goverment subsidizes the meat
industry  and feeds it to our children in public schools, further passifying
the  populace.  Everyone is trained to go  take a placebo of some sort: when
the  body  aches, when  the  head hurts,  when you  eat  too much,  and when
expectorating  the toxins  from our daily  bread.   Think about it!   If the
enemy  can be forced to spend its [two hours a day] concentrating on healing
and regrouping, there will be no time for attack.  That's what's being done.

     Take  the time to call your state  capitol.  Find out who your senators
and representatives are.  And PETITION!  Use the form we've included or make
your  own.  It doesn't  matter.  What DOES matter  is that people speak out.
Let it be known that we will no longer be butt-surfed.  Let it be known that
we, the people who make the laws, don't like the way things are going.  Tell
them  that you don't like gun control.  Tell them you want the right to kill
yourself.   Whatever it is  you feel strongly about,  let them KNOW!  Things
will change.  Get enough people, and things will change.

     So  don't just write.  Preach, brother.  Let the praises of freedom and
free-thinking  resound through the house and senate.  Tell everyone you know
what is being done.  Show them Phirst Amendment.  Get them to write Congress
and the Senate.  Draft letters regarding your beliefs and decision to not be
screwed any more.  Show these letters to friends.  Have THEM send copies!

     If we know we're being screwed, and all we do is turn around and watch,
we're not doing ourselves any good!

Cincinnati, OH-

     After  receiving complaints  from Cincinnati-area  teachers and parents
about the violent image of its `Savage Mondo Blitzer' dolls, Kenner Products
is changing the name of several of the toys.

    "While  the  figures are  based on  zany  fantasy characters,"  a Kenner
spokesperson  noted, "it appears that some  consumers are concerned with the
choice of names selected."

     The  more  vile characters  were dubbed,  `Snot Shot',  `Puke Shooter',
`Loaded Diaper', `Bad Fart', and `Projectile Vomit.'  We feel it safe to add
that test-market sales exceeded company expectorations.

Copenhagen-

     Average  sperm counts worldwide dropped from  113 million in 1938 to 66
million  in 1990, according  to scientists at  the University of Copenhagen.
Such a drastic decrease over such a short time suggests environmental rather
than  genetic causes, says professor Niels Skakkebaek.   It may be linked to
an  alarming rise is testicular  cancer, which is about  three to four times
more prevalent than it was a half-century ago.

     Public  opinion is  beginning to accept  what politicians  can't - that
condoms  should be distributed in schools.  Responding to a Gallup poll, 68%
of those surveyed, supported distribution.  However, 43% said condoms should
be  given to all students, while 25% approved of distribution, but only with
parental consent.

Faster Silicon Circuits-

     Westinghouse  Electronic Corp.  has received  a government  contract to
develop  silicon  transistors that  operate  at higher  speeds  than today's
devices.   This  new technology  is expected to  extend the  use of low-cost
silicon  substrates  into the  higher-frequency  regions of  radar, cellular
telephones, digital radio, and ultra-high-speed computing.

     The $624K U.S. Navy Research Laboratory contract, which extends through
the  end of 1993,  supports further development  of the silicon-on-insulator
technology-  called Microx.  The technology will be used for applications in
which  both microwave  radio and digital  functions are built  into the same
monolithic chip.

     Experimental microelectronic chips fabricated from Microx have operated
at  the  microwave frequencies  of 30GHz  and they  are expected  to achieve
40GHz,  smoothing the  way to a  new generation of  low-cost, mixed function
RF/digital  silicon monolithic circuits whose speeds are comparable to those
attained by gallium-arsenide devices.  Westinghouse believes these to be the
highest frequencies for linear MOS silicon transistors.

     The  key innovations are  ion-implanted oxide layers  produced within a
high-resistivity  substrate  that  resembles  an  insulator,  combined  with
several  advanced fabrication techniques.   According to  Michael C. Driver,
manager  of  microelectronics  at the  Westinghouse  Science  and Technology
Center,  Microx can  realize at  least 10 decibels  of power  gain at 10GHz.
This  performance, he said, coupled with the low cost typical of silicon MOS
technology, opens up a broad range of applications.

     You  had  information  on the  First  Amendment, do  you  have anything
related  on using the Freedom of Information Act to get inside info from the
government?

                                   -Gogang

[Well,  as a matter of fact, we do.  This issues primary focus is on how one
can more easily utilize, effectively, the Freedom of Information Act.

Addendum:

Other Success Stories! or More on the Modem Tax:

     After   receiving  countless   faxes  and   letters  of   inquiry  from
constituents,  the FCC has denied that there was ever an intention to create
a modem tax.   We brought it to you first, but with help from Compuserve and
Prodigy,  to name a few, this message has been QUITE widespread.  This is an
example of what can be done if people actually make it known that they don't
like what's going on.  It looks like the modem tax is a bust.  Situation- No
Go!   And I'd like to thank everyone that had a hand in this:  everyone that
passed  a text file,   everyone that sent  a fax,   everyone that held their
ground, when it all came down - THANKS!
