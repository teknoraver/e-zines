           Use of this program for non-commercial purposes is free.
           We do not sell it for profit, neither should anyone else.
           You can distribute it to your friends or BBSes as long
           as it is not modified and it includes this documentation.
           If you cannot obtain it from BBSes or FTP sites, then you
           can get it directly from us for a small fee of $10 US.
           Even if CatchMtE helps only one user to detect an MtE-based
           virus and saves him much agony, we consider our time spent
           developing CatchMtE well worth it.

    YOU MUST BOOT FROM A CLEAN, WRITE-PROTECTED DOS DISKETTE BEFORE USING
    CatchMtE TO SEARCH YOUR DISKS. THIS WILL ELIMINATE THE RISK OF HAVING
    A MEMORY-RESIDENT VIRUS GAIN CONTROL OF THE CPU DURING OPERATION.
    CatchMtE WILL REFUSE TO RUN IF IT DETECTS THAT THE PC WAS NOT BOOTED
    FROM A FLOPPY DISKETTE TO ENFORCE THIS REQUIREMENT.

Description:

   CatchMtE is designed to recognize viral code based on the so-called
Mutation Engine. It uses sophisticated algorithms to make that determination.
We have tested it on MS/PC DOS 3.3+ as well as Netware 386 based disks. On
network drives, some files may not be opened and will generate an error
message. The program uses handle-oriented DOS file access for compatibility.

   CatchMtE is NOT a pattern matcher; although it uses Boyer-Moore search
algorithm and a few patterns to recognize the mutations that are in plaintext.
This is necessary because MtE sometimes fails to encrypt code as expected.
The following known viruses are recognized if they are in plaintext:

   Pogue
   Dedicated/Fear
   Groove

If none of the patterns extracted from these viruses are found, then two
patterns extracted from MtE itself are searched for. This should detect
new viruses using MtE for polymorphism in the cases when the decryptor
has null effect.

   We have tested CatchMtE against thousands of Pogue and Dedicated/Fear
mutations in our lab. It achieved 100% hit rate in all cases. If you find
a mutation that it fails to recognize, please contact us so that we can
determine the cause and make the necessary corrections to the program.

   CatchMtE is NOT a general virus scanner. It only looks for MtE-based
viruses. If you would like to search your disks for other viruses as well,
you should obtain a scanner such as F-PROT, SCAN, VIREX or VDSFSCAN, all
of which are available via anonymous FTP at various sites. They can look
for hundreds of other known viruses.

Requirements:

   IBM/PC compatible computer with DOS 3.0 or higher
   128K of available memory
   Booting from floppy diskette is also required

Limitations:

   Only the files with COM or EXE extension are checked. If the file
   size is less than 1K, it will be skipped as well.
   Subdirectories are scanned recursively. It does not check one single
   file. To scan a drive, you must specify the root directory (e.g. C:\).

Usage:

   CATCHMTE.EXE  [-Mono] [-Pause] [-Ofname] [-Zfname]  Drive:\Subdirectory

   Example:
      To search C: drive starting from root directory:

         CATCHMTE.EXE  -P -Oinfected.txt -Zpassed.txt  C:\

      To search another directory and all subdirectories:

         CATCHMTE.EXE  -p  C:\DOS

 -Mono option forces CatchMtE not to use color output to make it easier
  to read on some screens, mostly laptops emulating VGA.

 -Pause option will allow you to see the list of infected files a screen
  at a time; otherwise, they will scroll off the screen, so you should use
  it unless you are testing the program against a zoo of mutations to verify
  hit rate, as we did.

 -O option will write the names of the files that were found to have an
  MtE-based virus to the specified file. Final statistics will also be
  written to this file.

 -Z option will write the names of the files that were found NOT to have an
  MtE-based virus to the specified file. This is good for zoo testing
  since it will provide a list of mutations that were MISSED. If you are
  not doing zoo testing, you do not need this option. If you find such a
  mutation, please send us a copy of at least the decryptor portion if not
  the complete sample for analysis.

Advice:

   You are strongly encouraged to consider integrity checkers as a first
line of defense against virus attacks. There are some products in the market
that concentrate on integrity checking. They can provide you with an early
warning that can save you many man-hours of work. Once the spread of viruses
is contained, they are not a significant threat.
   Virus scanning software is useful in looking for known viruses. They are
not meant to detect new viruses. With the escalating number of viruses and
toolkits such as MtE, you are more likely to encounter new viruses that
scanners cannot keep up with.
   We have developed an anti-viral product (VDS, or Virus Detection System)
that emphasizes integrity checking. A trial version of the package is
available at anonymous FTP-sites and BBSes free of charge. To obtain a
registered copy ($25 + SH for personal version), you can call us at
