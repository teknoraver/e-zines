1. Since this is the season of salary negotiations as well as holiday
cheer, we are sending you a gift of the main tables from the new (1997)
SANS Salary Survey.   You'll get the complete survey report with all
fourteen tables at SANS98 (or NT-SANS), but we hope the tables at the end
of this note are helpful in any immediate salary discussions.

2. In the past week, we've gotten more than twenty emails asking whether
we allow people to register early for SANS98 (Monterey in May) or asking
for early data about the courses and program.  Earlier today we put the
finishing touches on the program and sent it off to the printers.  We'll
mail it, along with the new "Roadmap to Network Security" poster, in late
January.  But if you need something right away, we have an email version
of the schedule and registration form you can use to register using 1997
funds or to get a head start on the approval process.  To get a copy,
reply to this email with the subject: SANS-1, SANS-2, or SANS-3.  For
SANS-1 we'll send you the list of 51 courses scheduled at SANS98, For
SANS-2 we'll send the list of courses plus the program (peer-reviewed
sessions, invited sessions, and eleven short-courses) for the five-track
technical conference. SANS-3 will get you the courses, the program and a
registration form.

I hope the new year brings you health and happiness.

China clamps new controls on the Net
Reuters

BEIJING -- China clamped sweeping new controls on the Internet on Tuesday,
warning that the network was being used to leak state secrets and to spread
``harmful information.''

Regulations unveiled by Zhu Entao, Assistant Minister for Public Security,
cover a wide range of crimes, including leaking state secrets, political
subversion and spreading pornography and violence.

The rules are also designed to protect against computer hacking, viruses and
other computer-related crime.

They call for unspecified ``criminal punishments'' and fines of up to 15,000
yuan ($1,800) for Internet providers and users who violate the rules -- both
individuals and business organisations.

One article says the Internet must not be used to ``split the country,'' a
clear reference to separatist movements in Tibet and the Moslem region of
Xinjiang.

Another on ``defaming government agencies'' appears designed to combat use
of the Internet by dissidents. A number of Chinese political exiles have
home pages which they use to attack the Beijing government.

The regulations explicitly cover information circulating from Hong Kong,
Macau and Taiwan.

Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule this year and Portuguese-run Macau will
be handed back in 1999. China regards Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel
province.

The official Xinhua news agency quoted Zhu as telling a news conference on
Monday that Internet links since 1994 had boosted China's cultural and
scientific exchanges with the world.

``But the connection has also brought about some security problems,
including manufacturing and publicising harmful information, as well as
leaking state secrets through the Internet,'' he said.

The regulations, contained in 25 articles, were approved by the State
Council, or cabinet, on December 11 and took effect Tuesday.

They go beyond earlier provisional regulations first promulgated in February
1996 and revised in May 1997, which also ban pornography and warn against
leaking state secrets.

Chinese authorities have made attempts to censor pornography, politics and
Western news organisations on the Internet. But with scores of providers,
Chinese surfers have been able to find almost anything they want.

It was not immediately clear whether Beijing would devote more resources to
policing the Internet now that new regulations were in place.

Xinhua cited figures from the Internet Information Centre of China showing
more than 49,000 host computers and 250,000 personal computers were
connected to the Internet at the end of October.

Under the new regulations, Internet providers would be subject to
supervision by Public Security officials and would be required to help track
down violators.

Zhu said the regulations would ``safeguard national security and social
stability,'' Xinhua said.

Computer networks were now indispensable as tools for managing state
affairs, economic construction, defence and science and technology, he said.
They were a pillar of social development.

``Hence, the safe and effective management of computer information networks
is a prerequisite for the smooth implementation of the country's
modernisation drive,'' he said.

THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD (CyberPatrol again)

CyberPatrol blocks a gay community of 23,400 Web sites

by Jonathan Wallace jw@bway.net

 Censorware software vendors say that they rarely make mistakes,
and correct them quickly when called to their attention.
CyberPatrol's block of an online neighborhood called West
Hollywood sheds some interesting light on this assertion.

Geocities is a free Web hosting service, organized into
"neighborhoods" of shared interests. The West Hollywood
neighborhood of Geocities,
http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/, is for gay people. The
entire West Hollywood neighborhood, of 23,400 separate Web sites,
is blocked by CyberPatrol, a product of Microsystems Inc., a
Boston company.

There were a few hardcore pictures on a few West Hollywood Web
pages, despite Geocities terms of service which ban pornography
on the system. There were tens of thousands of other pages which
contained no objectionable material at all. CyberPatrol critics
say that Microsystems threw out a very large baby with a small
amount of bathwater.

Bob Parker is the Community Leader Liaison for West Hollywood--a
sort of volunteer Webmaster. In a long, impassioned post to the
fight-censorship mailing list, cross-posted to Microsystems and
numerous other recipients, he quoted the Geocities terms of
service, which ban the display of "material containing nudity or
pornographic material of any kind." The company also has a
full-time "Community Response Team" which investigates complaints
filed by anyone, Geocities customer or not, about violations of
the terms of service.  In addition, West Hollywood maintains its
own "Neighborhood Watch" program. Parker pointed out that
Microsystems chose to block a community of 23,400 sites when
there was an alternative: "[A]ll it would have taken was a few
minutes of investigation on the part of Microsystems to find out
about the Neighorhood Watch program at GeoCities, get the sites
taken care of and avoid this whole situation."

Challenged to justify the West Hollywood block, Microsystems CEO
Dick Gorgens reacted equivocally.  "Upon my review, you were
absolutely correct in your assessment that the subdirectory block
on WestHollywood is prejudicial to the Gay and Lesbian Geocities
community," he told the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation, a group which sits on a CyberPatrol oversight
committee convened by Microsystems.  But then he seemed  to claim
that the majority of West Hollywood web pages are pornographic:
 "We took the 'easier' approach to blocking the small number of
actionable non-nudity publishers in that area rather than
individually sanctioning them." But he acknowledged that
"[t]aking  that technique to the limit would have us pull the
plug on the entire Internet which is obviously not our plan." He
pledged that the West Hollywood "problem" would be corrected
within a week. Two weeks later, it still has not been.

"GLAAD was extremely disappointed that such a discriminatory move
was made by Microsystems," wrote Loren Javier, the organization's
interactive media director. Critics had suggested that the
organization reconsider its role in advising Microsystems--that
the organization might be providing cover to the company without
actually preventing the product from blocking legitimate
gay-oriented sites. Javier wrote:  "The issue now is whether
GLAAD will continue to serve on the oversight committee.  I have
sent a message to Dick Gorgens with conditions that I be able to
review the complete block list and that I be able to ask why
sites have been blocked." Microsystems has not previously allowed
its oversight committee members to view the CyberNot list.

The blocking of West Hollywood raises the issue of whether it is
possible to filter the Internet at all. At five minutes per
site--a very cursory amount of time to determine whether a Web
page is "appropriate" under Microsystems' criteria--it would take
a company employee 1950 hours, a little more than one
person-year, to review every site in West Hollywood.  And West
Hollywood's pages constitute just a tiny drop of the estimated
200 million documents on the Internet. Though Microsystems says
that it uses a tool called Cyber Spyder to winnow the Net and
select sites for review, every page returned by the tool as a
potential candidate for blocking  is still reviewed by a human
being.  No-one seriously claims that any software possible today
is capable of making the kinds of subjective determinations
necessary in evaluating the "appropriateness" of Web pages.
Censoring the net will always be a labor-intensive effort.

The blocking of West Hollywood is not an isolated instance.  A
report issued this week by The Censorware Project, an ad hoc
group of which I am a member, lists fifty Web hosting services
blocked in their entirety by Cyberpatrol, even though the
majority of user pages on these services are legitimate. One of
them, members.tripod.com, hosts 1.4 million Web pages.  (Source:
"Blacklisted by CyberPatrol: From Ada to Yoyo,"
http://www.spectacle.org/cwp/.)

Faced with the near impossible task of reviewing the
entire Net, censorware companies like Microsystems
will continue to take the easy way out.

Robert Corn-Revere filed a ground-breaking federal
lawsuit challenging the use of another censorware
product, X-Stop, in the Loudoun County, Va.,

I'll discuss the case in an upcoming SLAC bulletin.)

(1) INDUSTRY RESPONDS TO ONLINE COMMUNITY'S OUTRAGE OVER WIDESPREAD
    AVAILABILITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Dec. 18--In the wake of last year's public uproar over the providing of
unique, personal identifiers like Social Security numbers, unlisted phone
numbers and birthdates over the Internet, the country's three leading
credit bureaus and individual reference services have pledged to stop
making that information available to the general public, according to a
report the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released yesterday. The Center
for Democracy and Technology (CDT) applauds the FTC, the credit bureaus and
the reference services for their work, but warns that it doesn't entirely
solve the problem of protecting consumers at a time when Web sites that
provide fast, easy access to public records containing personal information
on individuals are proliferating.

The Individual Reference Services Group (IRSG)--an industry coalition
composed of Experian, LEXIS-NEXIS, Equifax Credit Information Services,
Inc., Trans Union Corp., and 10 other companies--has agreed to abide by a
set of self-regulatory principles aimed at curbing access to sensitive
private data on individuals. The issue of personal information made widely
and easily available to the general public via the Internet first drew a
public outcry in September 1996 when LEXIS-NEXIS began offering
individuals' mothers' maiden names, Social Security numbers and dates of
birth on its "P-Trak" database. At the height of the controversy Congress
asked the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission to study
the privacy implications of this practice. The FTC's report is available at
http://www.ftc.gov/opa/9712/inrefser.htm. The Federal Reserve Board issued
its report earlier this year.

"The companies involved in the IRSG's effort are to be commended for
stepping up to the plate and crafting the most comprehensive set of
self-regulatory guidelines of any US industry, however, a number of
important consumer and privacy issues remain to be addressed before this
can be considered a complete solution," said CDT Staff Counsel Deirdre
Mulligan, who focuses on privacy issues.

COMPANIES' PROPOSAL RESPONDS TO PRIVACY CONCERNS

The IRSG proposal responds to concerns  raised by Internet users and
privacy advocates last September, available at
http://www.cdt.org/privacy/960920_Lexis.html, by:

*   prohibiting the distribution of Social Security Numbers, dates of birth,
    unlisted phone numbers, and mothers' maiden names to the general public;

*  prohibiting "reverse Social Security Number (SSN)" look-ups (finding a name
   or address based on an SSN);

*  requiring companies offering look-up services to the general public to allow
   people to "opt-out" of these databases;

*  providing individuals with access to information held by the companies that
   does not come >from public records; and

*  prohibiting the distribution of information about children unless it is for
   the purpose of locating a missing child.

Experian, LEXIS-NEXIS and the other companies have promised to exchange
database information only with other companies who also follow these
principles, a decision that will increase the principles' effectiveness.
Signers of the IRSG proposal also agree to undergo yearly audits of their
practices and to make those audits available to the public. The audit
records and the principles will help the FTC investigate instances where
companies have not complied with the guidelines.

SEVERAL IMPORTANT AREAS STILL BE BE ADDRESSED BY GUIDELINES

The IRSG proposal falls short of providing complete protection for
sensitive consumer information in a number of important areas, Mulligan
said. They include the following:

* Individuals will not be provided access to public records held by the
  companies that sign the proposal.

CDT believes that the companies should provide individuals full access to
their own personal information. These companies have an important role to
play--just as they serve as a one-stop shopping source for other
businesses, they should allow individuals access to information >from a
centralized source.

* Individuals will not be notified of adverse decisions based on data in the
  companies' files.

Many people are unaware that others are using information services to make
decisions about them. If data in a company's file comes from inaccurate
public records or has been inaccurately transcribed, a consumer could be
harmed. People should be notified when information >from the IRSG
companies' files are used to make decisions about them so that they can
correct inaccurate data, challenge inaccurate assumptions, or deal with
real problems reflected in the data.

* The IRSG companies will not maintain detailed audit trails, even though they
  will undergo yearly audits.

CDT believes that accountability requires strict oversight over access to
and use of personal information. When the end-users of sensitive personal
data are law enforcement personnel, employers, or others who can exercise
power over the consumer, an audit trail that documents the end-user's
treatment of personal information would help curb abuses, prevent
unauthorized access, and provide accountability to the system.

* Individual consumers have no SIMPLE way to SEEK RELIEF from violations of the
  guidelines.

The IRSG proposal doesn't provide a grievance process nor remedies for
consumers who believe credit decisions have been made on the basis of
inaccurate data. CDT hopes that the industry and the FTC will work to craft
a grievance process and remedies that are responsive to consumers' needs.

CDT believes that the IRSG proposal is a noteworthy step towards meaningful
self-regulatory guidelines. We commend the FTC for their work in this area
and encourage the agency to continue to monitor not only further
developments in this area, but also the implementation and compliance with
the IRSG guidelines. Strong enforcement of the guidelines and consumer
education are key to effective work in this area.

Still, as we noted last year, the wide spread availability and use of
public record information is a continuing breeding ground for privacy
concerns. See http://www.cdt.org/privacy/961008_Sen_let.html. As the FTC
notes in its report, "the easy availability of sensitive, unique
identifiers (e.g. Social Security number, mother's maiden name, and date of
birth) listed on public records increases the risk of serious harm."

Clinton signs Net antipiracy act
By Courtney Macavinta
December 17, 1997, 10:00 a.m. PT

President Clinton signed a law that makes online piracy a felony
offense, even if the guilty parties never profit from exchanging
unauthorized digital copies of software, music, or literature.

Drafted by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), the No Electronic Theft
(NET) Act, signed yesterday, makes distributing or possessing illegal
copies of online copyrighted material a federal crime if the value of
the works is $2,500 or more.

Based on the new law, offenders could get up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine for "willfully" possessing ten or more illegal
digital copies of film clips or computer programs, for example. A
misdemeanor charge will be filed for copied material with a retail
value of $1,000 or more, and comes with up to a one-year jail term.

There are a slew of high-tech and Net-related bills awaiting Congress
members when they return from vacation in January. So far, however, the
NET Act is only the third high-tech bill signed by Clinton this year.
In August, the president approved an export tax exemption of up to 15
percent for the software industry, which other industries had enjoyed
since 1971. He also approved $425 million for the Education
Department's Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, which allocates funds
to states for hardware, software, and online access.

The Software Publishers Association (SPA) and the U.S. Copyright Office
lobbied for the bill's passage. But the 80,000-member Association for
Computing Machinery urged Clinton to veto the bill. The international
group of computer scientists argued that the law would undermine the
public's right to use portions of copyrighted material under the U.S.
'fair use' doctrine.

However, some legal experts disputed the association's claims. Still,
the new law gives the Microsoft-backed SPA more ammunition in its
ongoing crackdown on alleged Net pirates who share, as opposed to
selling, unauthorized copies of valuable software.

Subject: File 6--No Electronic Theft Act; who's to judge?

Fortunately (for the those who might be accused, rather than the author)
"retail price" is not the same as a falsely inflated list price.  An
attempt to pursue an action based on a falsely inflated prices is very
nearly doomed.  As long as the accused or the accused's attorney is aware
of the past rulings that deal with actual prices paid rather than one
falsely claimed by the accuser everything will work out okay.

The same holds for selective enforcement of copyrights.  The main reason a
huge, rich firm like Disney goes after every copyright violation so
fiercely, even one by a small, poor day care center with hand painted,
not-for-profit, just to amuse the children material, is to maintain the
copyright.  If the accused or the accused's attorney is aware of the
rulings that deal with selective enforcement everything will work out
okay.

Of course that isn't to say the accused isn't going to have to spend money
and time on a defense, after all justice isn't free.
