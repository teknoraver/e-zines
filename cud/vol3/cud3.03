Article Format

We've been receiving an increasing number responses using software that
auto-cites. *PLEASE* don't quote long lines of texts if they are not
relevant to your article. Also, make sure that that attribution of
authorship goes to the proper person (as in "josie blowsie writes:") rather
than to the CuD editors (unless we in fact wrote it). Most editors are
picking up the "jut2" line, especially in the mailbag file.  In long
articles, it helps to have a blank space between each paragraph and to
avoid odd or unprintable characters which some systems have difficulty
reading.

HACK-TIC Magazine
++++++++++++++++

We received our first copy of HACK-TIC, a CU periodical from Amsterdam. We
don't read Dutch, so we tried to wing it from German. The size and layout
are similar to 2600. We received Issue 11-12 (47 pages), which contains
technical information, articles on the E911/PHRACK trial, Milnet, Cartoons,
and other news from Europe. There is enough substance that one need not
speak Dutch to get a decent value from picking up the stray bits in English
(such as a decoder program for Wordperfect files).

Greetings!

I wanted to help clear up any misconceptions some people might have regarding
TAP Magazine.  The first point is that I am no longer editor.  After Craig
Neidorf got molested, I decided do let go of TAP and concentrate on more
important things.  Therefore, I handed editorship to Predat0r.  Since then, I
have had NOTHING to do with TAP Magazine.  The second point is the details of
the subscription.  I am not totally sure of this but it is what I hear.  TAP
is not free anymore (I don't know why. I put it out for free), it is now $2
for a SAMPLE issue.  The yearly rates are $10 for ten issues.  If anyone has
any questions regarding TAP, don't mail me.  Mail them to Predat0r at the
above address.

If anyone wants to correspond with ME, you can mail me at

The "monopolies" have only the powers to charge for the services that are
tariffed by the local and state public utilities commissions for intrastate
services, and the Federal Communication Commission on the interstate
services.

The charges for local service come under the jurisdiction of the PUC's, and
not the FCC.  If the operating company can convince the local PUC that a
BBS is business, then they will be able to "legally" charge business rates
for connections that are used for BBS's.

Keep in mind that telephone service is not a guaranteed right.  The low
residential service rates are due to a state and federal government policy
dating from early in the century, which was aimed at providing universal
telephone service, much in the same way that the government have provided
roads to encourage the mobility of the automobile.

A case could easily be made that more than one line to a
residence/household is a luxury, and all additional lines should be billed
at a higher rate.  Fortunately, generally the telephone companies have not
tried for this, but instead have limited the attempts to charge business
rates to BBS's solely to BBS's that could be viewed as businesses, such as
ones that charge for access.

Businesses are charged more for their service because they are expected to
make more use of the telephone system, and thus cause greater wear on the
system.  BBS's, like teenagers, blow that equation all out of the water.

- There are a lot of rumours about this type of thing, only I've never seen
- it actually put into action.

Southwestern Bell, in Houston, Tx, attempted to define all BBS's with more
than one phone line as businesses, for the purposes of billing, whether
they charged a fee for not.  As part of this, they also claimed that BBS's
that had a mandatory upload's for access were also businesses, since the
user was required to provide something in order to gain access.  [I may not
have all of the above 100% correct, but that seems to be the gist of it]

I have also heard that GTE in Indiana has tariffed that all BBS's that
charge for access get business rates.  At least GTE went through the PUC in
getting that one through, unlike SWBT.

And in response, at least in the case of the SWBT action, a group of BBS
operators in Texas (and Oklahoma) fought the action.  For the most part, I
gather that they have succeeded, but not completely.

I doubt that I have made anyone happy by reading the above, but hopefully,
I have made people more informed.

- Why, you ask, do I think the CU is sexist?

I will agree that there is a very strong male bias in the entire computing
industry, and probably even more so in the underground.  Why?  I have no
real idea, although a guess that pops to mind is (Gross Generalizations
here!) many women would rather do things more secure and "safe" than play
on the edges in the underground.  How true that is, I don't know.  I would
say that is a stereotypical perception that is not well held up by the
women I know.

- Second, BBSs, especially those catering to adolescents and college
- students, are frightening in their mysogeny. I have commonly seen in
- general posts on large boards on college towns discussion of women in the
- basest of terms (but never comparable discussions of men), use of such
- terms as broads, bitches, cunts, and others as synonymous with the term
- "woman" in general conversation, and generalized hostile and angry
- responses against women as a class.

This, unfortunately, does exist, even in what are supposed to be some of our
most enlightened environments, the university campus.  But keep in mind, this is
also how they were taught by the outside society before entering the
enlightening halls of the university, and they should be exposed to ideals
that indicate that their actions and beliefs may be flawed, or even incorrect.
It does nothing to complain about these people, they need to be exposed to a
greater, less biased world than the one from which they came.

Some will reject it, because it will suddenly devalue their self worth, or the
views/beliefs they held upon entering are to strong, but after time (perhaps
generations) they will be in the definite minority, and perhaps even extinct.

- Third, sexism is rampant on the nets. The alt.sex (bondage, gifs,
- what-have-you) appeal to male fantasies of a type that degrades women. No,
- I don't believe in censorship, but I do believe we can raise the gender
- implications of these news groups just as we would if a controversial
- speaker came to a campus.  Most posts that refer to a generic category tend
- to use male specific pronouns that presume masculinity (the generic "he")
- or terms such as "policeman" or "chairman" instead of "chair" or "police
- officer."

It is my belief that many people consider "chairman" and "policeman" to be
generic terms for "chair" and "police officer" I have heard my youngest
sister refer to herself as a "policeman" on several occasions, although she
does tend to use "police officer" a bit more often.

As to rampant sexism on the "nets", I cannot say.  I only frequent USENET
and internet mailing lists for my net based reading.  What it is like on
the Fido echo's etc, I do not know.  In general, most of the postings I see
on USENET are of very open, somewhat liberal, attitude.  I suppose that the
alt.sex hierarchy could be considered degrading, but I am unsure how.  What
I see in those groups that I read there are generally open, fairly well
reasoned discussions of items of a sexual nature, as well as some
discussions attempting to show some users the error of their ways of
belief.  Those do degenerate in to some impressive flame wars, but there
has been little I could see as being viewed as degrading/demeaning.

-Why don't we think about and discuss some of
- this, and why isn't CuD taking the lead?!

Good question.  If the computer underground is truly on the cutting edge of
future society, then lets take the chance to rework our (and the rest of
the nations/worlds) views on sexism, racism, and all the other -ism's out
there.  These sorts of actions start at home!

And in doing so, we shouldn't flame those who hold opposing opinions,
rather we should listen to them, and reason with them.  Find out why they
hold the beliefs they do, and politely attempt to enlighten them.

All in all, I would say that Ms.  Borden makes some very good points,
points we all could do well to consider, and act upon.  The computer
industry needs to make a more intense effort to draw women into the
industry, and we of the computer underground need to draw them into the
mainstream of the underground.

Subject: No Room for Dinosaurs
Date: Mon, 14 Jan 91 08:21:22 -0500

Over the past year, I have been reading about three subjects which have
converged in my twisted mind to create an apprehension.  AT first
realization, I actually felt a little paranoid, but quickly realized
that no conspiracy was taking place.  That left me with apprehension of
something it took me awhile to understand, though dimly still.

The three subjects about which I have been reading, actually tracking,
are (1) the quickening use of law and enforcement to control certain
elements of the computer literate in society, (2) the efforts on the
part of telecom companies to charge business rates for BBS phone
service, and (3) the mass marketing of computer information services
such as GENIE, COMPUSERVE, and (the worst or the best) PRODIGY.

In that instant of paranoia, I asked myself whether these three forces
were conspiring to squeeze me (and people like me) into conformity or
extinction.  When the paranoia passed, leaving me with an uncomfortable
apprehension, I knew it was no conspiracy, just powerful forces moving
in a like direction;  all three forces a reaction to the permeation of
computers throughout all facets of our society.

I support law and enforcement, an our responsibility to control the
excesses of those who govern us.  I support a free market economy in
which telecom companies and computer services companies make a buck.  I
understand the position PRODIGY takes; that they are a publisher who
will exercise editorial control (in response to advertisers
sensitivities.)  Still, though, something uneasy lingers in my soul.

The recent contributions to CUD about sexism in the CU sharpened the
focus of my apprehension.

I earned my first job as a systems programmer by penetrating a security
hole in the university's mainframes.  I like to refer to my sailboat as
"she".  I am going to sail around the world someday soon.  And, I'm
still looking for opportunities to achieve technical feats for the
simple pleasure of doing it.  Oh yes, I smoke a pipe, too.  I'm a
dinosaur.

When I earned my first systems programmer job, there wasn't a computer
underground.  We were the elite, and held in awe for our abilities.  We
were pretty responsible too.

I am wondering whether there is much of a computer underground now.  When
issues of sexism or equal access to computers by the handicapped
permeate the computer underground, it won't be an underground anymore.
(I bet that one will get a few flames.  I'm handicapped, and I have felt
discrimination, but CUD isn't the forum for discussing it.)  Anyway, to
the point, soon, I fear, the hackers, and others on the frontier of
computing, who seek to express their individualism, will go the way of
the dinosaur.  I finally realized my apprehension for what it was; the
fear of dying, of being `passed by' by forces too powerful to resist,
too conformist to join.

Actually, I do join those forces.  Life is full of compromise.  The
joining is a form of dying in itself.  Better than dying from
starvation, I guess.

In CUD 2.19 it was mentioned about "10,000 hackers couldn't break into our
system".  It is True.  Our computer club received a mailer offering $5,000
to anyone who could break in if they told them how they did it.   It looked
like a interesting offer.  They gave a bunch of phone numbers that their
computer was on.  I don't have the flyer anymore.  Got it late spring/early

Regardless of the other issues at stake here, the surprising fact is that
the above statement is completely false -- the costs of a connected line
are much higher than those of an unconnected line.

The costs associated with a local phone call fall into three categories:

	the cost of having the line installed
	the cost of setting up and taking down the call
	the cost of maintaining the signal path while the call is in progress

Since traditional phone lines have been used for only a tiny fraction of
the day, the phone companies have spent much money and cleverness at
reducing the "fixed cost" of an installed phone line.  It is much harder to
reduce the cost of maintaining a signal path -- the number of switching
elements in the central office must be sufficient to handle the number of
calls likely to be in progress at any moment, which is presumed to be far
smaller than the number of phone lines.  In practice, the total costs of
maintaining the signal paths are considerably higher than the fixed costs
of the installed lines.  The net result is that a line which is connected
24 hours a day costs the phone co. far more than a line which is used very
little, because it is the connections which consume the expensive
resources.

That is why a leased line costs much more than basic message unit service.

(If you don't believe me, check any book on the design of telephone
systems.)

If I remember correctly, they market some sort of a callback modem.  What
they then did was issue an open challenge to all hackers to call a system
through their modem and get a text file or something similar in the system.
The first time they had the "LeeMah Hacker Challenge", there were 8000+
attempts by hackers, none successful. The second time there were only 2000+
attempts, apparently because many hackers thought it was a new attempt by
Big Brother to identify them.

Note: although there were more than 10,000 *attempts* to get by their
product, LeeMah cannot justify saying that means that 10,000 hackers tried,
unless each hacker tried only once. Somehow I doubt that.

Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with LeeMah, nor did I take part in either
of their "Challenges". I just recall reading about it.

Gail Thakeray has in fact made either untrue, half-true or misleading
statements to the press and public at large. I heard her discussing the
"hacker" problem last year live on-air on radio and she did in make such
statements to support her position against certain, not-necessarily-criminal
computer experts. She is supposed to know the law and specialize in computer
crime but she made herself out to be against anyone who not only may have
committed computer crime but also those who may be potentially capable
(whatever that means, either possessed of the moral or technological
capability, or whatever) to commit a crime. The sum of the position stated
was that nothing would be allowed to get in her way to seek out and
prosecute alleged computer criminals.

She seems inconsistent in her position and her department's policy and I,
for one, see no reason therefore to trust anything she may say.

January 29 and 30, at 9:00am on both days.  The hearing should last for

                     The Consequences of a Philosophy
                              by David Daniel


I am moved to write this piece primarily by the Dark Adept's essay which
appeared in CUD 2.18. He brought up many aspects of the 'hacker mentality'
which have served and are serving to produce concern within the business
and law enforcement community.

Unfortunately, many of his assertions are based on common misconceptions
about how businesses operate. Mr. Adept presented a distorted view of the
'capitalist mentality'. I hope to correct these misconceptions based on my
experience in both computer and non-computer related businesses.

Mr. Adept mentioned the restrictive aspects of patents and copyrights but
offered no proof to support his claim. He also misstated the scope of a
patent right. A patent only covers the method by with an invention performs
its task. For example, I could invent a new form of sewing machine with
only three moving parts and a revolutionary means of fixing various
materials together. My patent would cover the means by which my devise
achieves its purpose. Further, my patent would free me to release my
invention to the world and to invite any and all those interested to study
it. It's likely that Singer would be quite impressed and I could rest
assured that I would receive due compensation if Singer decided to
manufacture and/or market it.  Mr. Adept expressed his belief that a user
interface was generic. I'm sure we could find many hard working programmers
who would heartily disagree as well as corporate executives who have
overseen the expenditure of many thousands or man-hours and dollars in the
developement of a unique software product. Don't they deserve a return on
their investment? Mr. Adept denies the existence of license agreements when
he asserts that an inefficient company can tie up a good interface by tying
it to a bad program. He also denies the idea of a joint marketing venture
by two or more companies which combine their strongest products.

Mr. Adept wrote about the danger of protecting algorithms since they are
merely mathematical models. Should we consider DOS and BIOS in the same
category? Should these proprietary packages be freely circulated without
compensation? It might be an attractive utopian concept but not workable
within our present system.

I see the issue ultimately as one of philosophical ethics. It pits the
hacker/cracker/phreaker community with their latter-day Robin Hood persona
against the free enterprise business community with their 'what's mine is
mine' attitude. The struggle has been going on for years and will likely
continue.  There is a phrase, "putting a head on a pike". It arose from an
ancient custom of removing the head of an enemy and placing it on a long
pole anchored in the ground for all to see. It served to warn off other
would-be attackers and it sometimes worked. I see many of the recent
hacker/cracker prosecutions as just such a piking of heads. It is the price
that certain members of the computer underground have paid for the exorcise
of their philosophy. As to whether or not it's working only time will tell.
I'm sure that some have been deterred while others have been moved to act.
I'd like to see the two divergent mentalities reach a compromise.  I truly
believe a compromise possible. Even though it won't be easy it's a valuable
goal that should be worked toward. The alternatives are more of what we've
been seeing over the last few years: More prosecutions, more paranoia
within the business community and more invasive behavior on the part of the
federal government. None of us want this regardless of which side of the
proverbial fence we reside. Lets all become part of the solution rather
than adding to the problem.

that, and it is included with, every copy of COPS that gets put out.
However, the way you posted it, it is unclear that this is the case;
indeed, people are asking me why I would post such a thing anonymously to
your journal, apparently unaware that it is included as part of my package
(the first person is used, so it would be a poor subterfuge :-)).  If you
would just mention something to the effect that I didn't send that to you,
I'd appreciate that -- I certainly stand by all the words that I wrote, but
it just seems a bit odd the way it is presented there, without the full
background.  If I send something to your fine journal, I'll certainly
include my own name.

  Thanks!

Subject: Bulgaria and Computer Viruses
Date: 12-20-90 2253EST

   "BULGARIA'S LEADING HIGH-TECH EXPORT APPEARS TO BE COMPUTER VIRUSES"
                 From the New York Times, by Chuck Sudetic

SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Bulgaria has become the breeding ground of some of the
world's most lethal computer viruses, programs that are maliciously
designed to spread through computer memories and networks and at times
destroy valuable stored information like bank and medical records.

"We've counted about 300 viruses written for the IBM personal computer; of
these, 80 or 90 originated in Bulgaria," said Morton Swimmer of Hamburg
University's Virus Test Center, who specializes in diagnosing and curing
Eastern European computer viruses.

"Not only do the Bulgarians produce the most computer viruses, they produce
the best."

One Bulgarian virus, Dark Avenger, has infected American military
computers, said John McAfee, who runs the Computer Virus Industry
Association, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and tracks viruses for
computer hardware and software companies.

"I'm not saying that any super-secure computers have been infected," he
said. "But the U.S. Defense Department has about 400,000 personal
computers, and anyone who has that many machines has a 100 percent
probability of being hit."

"It is causing some people in sensitive places a lot of problems," a
Western diplomat here said, "and they are very reluctant to admit they have
them."

"I would say that 10 percent of the 60 calls we receive each week are for
Bulgarian viruses, and 99 percent of these are for Dark Avenger," McAfee
said, adding the virus has also attacked computers belonging to banks,
insurance and accounting companies, telecommunications companies and
medical offices.

"I've had a lot of calls from Frankfurt," Swimmer said. "One bank was very
nervous about it, but I can't reveal its name for obvious reasons."

Several experts say the spread of the Bulgarian viruses is less the result
of activities by the secret police than it is the consequence of having
developed a generation of young Bulgarians whose programming skills found
few outlets beyond hacking interventions.

A decade ago, this country's Communist leaders decided to make Bulgaria an
Eastern-bloc Silicon Valley, Vesselin Bontchev, a Bulgarian computer
specialist, said.  Bulgarian factories began turning out computers, and the

government introduced them into workshops, schools and institutes.  Many
computers, however, stood idle because people did not know how to apply
them or lacked an economic interest in doing so.

"People took office computers home, and their children began playing on
them," he said, adding that buying a private computer was almost
impossible.

These children quickly acquired software-writing skills, but had little or
no chance to apply them constructively, he said.

They began bootlegging copyrighted Western software, especially computer
games, by overriding devices written into the software to prevent it from
being copied. Then they started altering the operating systems that drive
the computer itself.

"From there it was one small step to creating viruses that attack files
when they are acted on by the operating system," he said.

Bontchev estimated there are only about a dozen young Bulgarian computer
programmers who have written the viruses that have caused all the trouble.

"Computer hackers here write viruses to show who is who in computer science
in Bulgaria, to find a place in the sun," said Slav Ivanov, editor of a
Bulgarian computer magazine. "The young computer people just don't rank in
our society. They don't receive enough money."

The average wage of a software writer in Bulgaria is about $30 a month,
Bontchev said.

One virus designer, however, acknowledged that revenge was also a factor.

"I designed my first computer virus for revenge against people at work,"
said Lubomir Mateev, who helped write a non-destructive virus known as
Murphy, which shares many of Dark Avenger's tricks.  "Our first virus made
all the computers at work send out a noise when they were switched on."

Mateev, 23, said he collaborated with Dark Avenger's designer last spring
on a new virus that is harder to diagnose and cure because it is
self-mutating.

"Dark Avenger's designer told me he would take a job as a janitor in a
Western software firm just to get out of Bulgaria," he said. Attempts
during several months to get in touch with Dark Avenger's creator proved
fruitless.

For now, Bulgaria's computer virus designers can act with complete legal
immunity.

"We have no law on computer crime," said Ivanov, whose magazine offers free
programs that cure known Bulgarian viruses.  "The police are only
superficially interested in this matter."

Bulgaria's secret-police computers have also been infected, said a
well-placed Bulgarian computer expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity
and refused to elaborate.

Dark Avenger has also spread to the Soviet Union, Britain, Czechoslovakia,
Poland and Hungary, Bontchev said, adding, "I've even had one report that
it has popped up in Mongolia."

"The Dark Avenger is the work of a Sofia-based programmer who is known to
have devised 13 different viruses with a host of different versions,"
Bontchev said. "He is a maniac."

Bontchev said he was almost certain Bulgaria's government was not involved
with Dark Avenger.

"A computer virus cannot be used as a weapon because it cannot be aimed
accurately and can return like a boomerang to damage programs belonging to
the creator himself," he said. "It can be used only to cause random damage,
like a terrorist bomb."

Unlike less infectious viruses, Dark Avenger attacks computer data and
programs when they are copied, printed or acted on in other ways by a
computer's operating system, Bontchev said. The virus destroys information
every 16th time an infected program is run.

A virus can spread from one computer to another either on floppy disks or
through computer modems or computer networks, he said.  Many viruses are
spread at computer fairs and through computer bulletin-board systems where
enthusiasts exchange information over the telephone.

Legislation on computer crime will be introduced in Parliament once a
criminal code is adopted, said Ilko Eskanazi, a parliamentary
representative who has taken an interest in the virus issue.

"We are now seeing viruses emerging on entirely new ground in Eastern
Europe," Bontchev said.

"Things may get much worse before they improve," he warned.  "The first law
of computer viruses is that if a virus can be made, it will be. The second
law is that if a computer virus cannot be made, it will be anyway."

          DECUS Bars Hacker: Meeting attendees focus on security
                              by Anne Knowles
            FROM:  From Communications Week December 24, 1990.

Las Vegas-While attendees of the DECUS user group meeting were busy
learning about DEC security, an infamous computer hacker was trying to
register for the Digital Equipment Computer User Society's Fall 90
Symposium.

Luckily for DECUS, the hacker was recognized by show personnel, who
refused him admittance.  DECUS contacted its lawyers and is now developing
a policy for dealing with such situations in the future, said bill
Brindley, president of the 30-year old user group.  In the interim, the
hacker was barred from the meeting.

DECUS is the organization for users of Digital Equipment Corp. systems and
ne tworks.  With 120,000 members worldwide, it is the largest user group of
its kind.  the group holds seminannual symposiums, week-long events of
daily seminars and hourly sessions on mostly technical topics concerning
its membership.

DECUS had never before been confronted by a hacker attempting to register
for one of its symposiums, Brindley said , though an attendee was evicted
from the show two years ago when he was discovered hacking.  DEC identified
this year's hacker as Kevin Mitnick, who is well-known to both DECUS and
DEC.  He is currently on probation after having been found guilty in
federal court of breaking into Easynet, DEC's internal computer network.
His probation stipulates that he not enter a networked system or one with a
modem, Brindley said.  During its symposiums, DECUS supplies networked
terminnals for attendee's use.  "It would have been logistically impossible
to restrict anyone [who had gained admittance to the show] from the
systems," Brindley said.

The article goes on to other items from this point, but this is the part
that deals directly with hacking.
