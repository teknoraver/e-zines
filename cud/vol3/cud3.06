Subject: Moderators' Corner
Date: February 23, 1991

A few comments in list format:

1) The Len Rose case is still pending. It is currently on a day-by-day
status as discussions occur. More on this later.

2) The concern about privacy and First Amendment issues in cyberspace
continues. We are re-printing Brock Meeks' original "FBI" article (see file
5 below) because it has aroused renewed interest. Brock also wrote a recent
story on the FBI running "sting"-type operations which we encourage all to
read. The concern impels us to do a special issue on it all within the next
few weeks.

3) For the next month or so, CuD will be coming out about bi-weekly because
of time constraints. Gordon has been transferred to Pennsylvania, but will
be commuting between the east and west coasts every two weeks as part of
his employment. Jim's publishers have lost all sense of humor and are
demanding the two promised books, long past deadline.

Has anyone seen the announcement for the Ides of March computer conference?

The reason it caught my attention is that one of the speakers is Gail
Thackery.

My question is: why?

Why is Gail speaking at a computer conference?  What does she know about
computers?

She probably does know a lot about prosecution, I don't doubt her ability
as a lawyer, but what does she know about computer crime specifically?

Ok.  We all know what she was involved in, but that just proves my point
further.  Those aren't exactly what you would call "clean" busts.  And with
Sundevil, there weren't even that many (any?) busts made.

It doesn't say much for her ability to prosecute computer crime.

What exactly is she going to speak about?  I can't figure that out.  Maybe
she's going to explain what KERMIT is or something.  Though, she should
explain that to law enforcement officials.

See, that's where I have this problem.  Here we have an individual speaking
at an industry conference, and this individual is not in the industry.  She
does not affect the industry except in destructive ways (if you want a list
on how it's been destructive, E-mail me.  It's too long for here).

And with her being on the Well and all, and now there's a rumor of her
getting some type of "honor" with Barlow at the Comps, Sec, and Priv
conference, I'm beginning to wonder how one becomes an authority on
computers.

Why not honor some beat cops who find some stolen PC's?  They have about as
much to do with computer crime and how it relates to the industry as Gail.

This is ridiculous.  Does anyone else see politics or something coming into
play here or is it just me?

If what law enforcement says is true, that most computer crime goes
unreported since companies don't want to publicly admit that they have
security problems, then aren't the companies bigger authorities on computer
crime than lawyers and cops and feds and what have you?

What can Gail tell an employee of AT&T or IBM or DEC or Maxis or Sierra or
whoever that they don't already know, and probably know better?  She can't
tell them how systems are broken into.  She can't tell them about a "ring"
of hackers/phreaks since there is no such animal.  She probably can't even
tell them what a macro is.

Just what we need.  The few decent people in the industry jumping in bed
with fascists.  Ha!  I'm conservative and a capitalist and all that, but I
still wouldn't throw what few morals I have out the door for an extra buck
or my name in lights or anything.

See, I agree with companies when they say that they don't want some punks
breaking into their computers.  I can even agree with arresting people who
do.  What I can't agree with is persecuting people (ala Len Rose) or
widespread terror tactics (ala Sundevil).  If I were a hacker I'd rather
have AT&T's internal security knocking at my door rather than Gail & Co.
seeing what they've done to people.

The only reason I can see for Gail to be there is to bury the hatchet.
Well, when you bury the hatchet with people who are experts at wielding
one, you can bet it'll end up in your back in the end.

Flames gratefully accepted.

***  CuD #3.06: File 3 of 6: CuD Archive Server                  ***
********************************************************************

Some people seem to be having problems using the email archive server based
here.  Here are some helpful hints:

a) place all commands to the archive server in the BODY of the message.  The
   server will ignore commands on the subject line.

b) do not use any slashes ('/') in any command.  The server does not know
   how to handle commands with slashes in the command.

c) use the "path" command.  Although we do have a fairly smart mailer, it's
   not foolproof.  This is especially true for sites that are not directly
   on the Internet.  UUCP sites should locate a node on the Internet (like
   uunet) and use it as a base.  Bitnet sites should add the suffix .bitnet
   to the end of their hostname.  For example:

        path uunet.uu.net!nexthost!myhost!me
        path me@bithost.bitnet

   This should eliminate problems getting to you.

d) If you're asking for many files, it helps to break up the send command
   into multiple files.  This is especially true for large files.  For example:

        send cud cud1.01
        send cud cud1.02
        send cud cud1.03
   is better than
        send cud cud1.01 cud1.02 cud1.03

e) Some helpful commands that the server knows:

       index
       index cud
       send cud cud-arch
       send cud chsun1.email.files

   Also, try and keep the files you request per send command to under 45000
   bytes.  Anything much larger than that will not be sent.  If you want
   very large files, send a special request to
   archive-management@chsun1.uchicago.edu and special arrangements will be
   made.

f) This is not the address for requesting futures issues of CuD to be mailed
   to you.  You should send those requests to: TK0JUT2@NIU.bitnet
   and place the address for being placed on the mailing list.

Thanks,

FELONY CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST "HACKER" 2/20/91

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1991 FEB 20(NB) -- The felony charges of
computer tampering and computer trespass have been dropped against Mark
Abene, known throughout the "hacker world" as "Phiber Optic". Abene pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized use of a computer and will
be sentenced on April 4th on that count.

The arrest of Abene by New York State Police on February 5th followed over
a year of uncertainty for Abene who had computer equipment and notes seized
during the execution of a search warrant on January 24th, 1990. At the time
of the arrest, it was alleged that Abene had electronically invaded a New
York Telephone Company computer and activated an unused telephone number.
He then supposedly arranged call forwarding to a "900" number to provide
free access to an otherwise chargeable service. These allegations led to
Abene being charged with the two felonies and a misdemeanor for theft of
services.

The dropping of the felony charges on February 19th in New York state court
was accompanied by a changing of the theft of services charge to one
alleging unauthorized use of a computer and it was the new charge to which
Abene pleaded guilty. Abene's attorney, Carol Grumbach of the firm of
Levinson & Kaplan told Newsbytes that she expects the April 4th sentencing
to result in Abene being granted youthful offender status and court records
sealed as a result. She also expects the remaining charge to be
conditionally discharged based on Abene's performance of community service
activities.

Abene, commenting on the resolution of the case, told Newsbytes "I'm very
glad that this is over. At least now, I know where I stand and that's much
better than it's been for the last year." Abene also said that the computer
equipment seized is still in the custody of the authorities and that it is,
as yet, unclear when it is to be returned.

On the same day in 1990 that the Abene's equipment was seized, search
warrants were also executed by New York State Police and United States
Secret Service agents on three other New York residents known by the hacker
names "Acid Phreak", "Scorpion" and "Flash". Newsbytes was told by informed
sources that Acid Phreak and Scorpion have been notified by the United
States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York that they are to be
charged under federal statutes for computer-related crimes. Newsbytes was
also told at the time of the Abene arrest that it was decided to charge him
under state law because his age at the time of the alleged incident would
have resulted in his classification as a minor under federal law. He was
charged as an adult under New York law.

Flash was arrested on February 13th by New York State Police and U.S.
Secret Service agents. was identified as Albert Kong, 23 and charged with
felony counts of computer trespass and 2nd degree grand larceny. At the
time of the arrest, New York State Police Senior Investigator Donald
Delaney told Newsbytes that there was no apparent connection between the
Kong case and the other cases.

The FBI Comes Rapping, Rapping At Your BBS
by Brock N. Meeks

(first published in MICROTIMES #44, June 1988)

If that new user on your local bulletin board system (BBS) seems to be
asking a few too many personal questions, you might want to reconsider
answering, unless of course, you don't mind your answers being stored in a
database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

That new user just might be a member of a special FBI task force scouring
the nation's  electronic landscape.  Or so contends Glen L.  Roberts,
director  of _The FBI Project_ which publishes _The FBI and Your BBS_ and a
privacy/surveillance newsletter called _Full Disclosure_.

"Now wait a minute," you say, "That smacks of radical LaRouche-type
paranoid rhetoric!"  OK, so I was a bit leery, too. After all the FBI is
such an easy target.  Then I started rummaging through an old, coffee
cup-ringed file labeled only "FBI/Computer Squad."  In there I found
several old clippings and other documentation that started to back up
Roberts' statements.

If You Dig, You Hit Dirt =========================

In 1984 a short series of discreet advertisements. placed by the FBI,
appeared in a few computer trade publications and in _The Wall Street
Journal_.  The message was simple, and went something like: "We're looking
for computer literate persons to join the Bureau."  There was no mention of
any special task force; however, it was clear that the Bureau wanted to
upgrade their high-tech prowess.

Although the FBI won't confirm the existance of a computerized "hit squad,"
a public relations officer from the Bureau did confirm that they "have made
an extraordinary effort to recruit more technically oriented personnel"
since 1984.

If you dig hard enough, you'll find substantial evidence that the FBI is
most definitely working overtime in its efforts to monitor the electronic
community.  "They are desperately wary of the way information flows so
freely in this medium," says Roberts.

There was a number scrawled on the inside flap of that dog-earred folder.
It was annotated "Former agent; possible source." I called the number; I
got a story.

"I was recruited in 1983 by the FBI for my computer skills," the former
agent told me.  Because he stills does some consulting for the Bureau, he
asked not to be identified, but he laid out a very specific plan by the FBI
to increase their knowledge of the electronic communications world.  He
confided, "If the Bureau is monitoring BBSs, it's a small group."  Much
more likely, he offered, the FBI is drawing on the expertise of a small
band of high-tech freelance snoops to augment their staff, until their
skills are honed.

One member of this freelance team is the well-known John Maxfield.  He's
appeared in everything from the _Washington Post_ to the Today Show to
_MicroTimes_, bragging about his undercover infiltration of "criminal BBSs"
on behalf of the FBI.  (When I asked a 17-year-old hacker from Texas why no
one's taken out Maxfield, via computer, the kid told me: "He's too visible;
he's guarded pretty well as far as his computer records go; we've tried.")

Tradition =========

Certainly the FBI has a tradition of "investigating" groups of people it
deems "unsavory" or threatening.  Recent published reports told of how the
FBI has gathered files on several pro- Sandanista groups here in the U.S.
This type of information gathering process seems to be standard operating
procedure for them.

The _New York Times_ broke a story last year on its front page that
detailed how FBI agents were visiting New York city libraries and asking
the librarians to monitor certain people and keep a record of the books
they checked out; the list would be given to the agent at a later date.
NYC librarians flatly declined the FBI offer.  Perhaps the most startling
aspect of the story was the "it doesn't hurt to ask" attitude that flowed
from the FBI when they were confronted and asked for an explanation.

In Roberts' _The FBI and Your BBS_, the a brief history of the FBI's
willingness to gather all known information on a target group is outlined.

Pulling from the Final Report of the Select (Senate) Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities, Book IV,
Supplemenatry Reports on Intelligence Activities, Roberts includes this
excerpt:

"Detectives were sent to local radical publishing houses to take their
books.  In addition, they were to find every private collection or library
in the possession of any radical, and to make the arrangements for
obtaining them in their entirety.  Thus, when the GID (General Intelligence
Division) discovered an obscure Italian born philosopher who had a unique
collection of books on the theory of anarchism, his lodgings were raided by
the Bureau and his valuable collection become one more involuntary
contribution to the huge and ever-growing library of the GID. [pages
87-88]."

Change "any radical" to "any BBS" and "book" to "disk" and quite suddenly
the electronic landscape turns into a winter still-life.

Data Collection ================

Roberts, quoting from his report, says, "Unlike other communications media,
information on a BBS does not get read by anyone before its instantaneous
publication.  Therefore, the FBI has much less of a possibility of
intimidateing the owner of a BBS into _not_ publishing certain information.
The FBI also acts as if BBSs have a monopoly on the distribution of
so-called 'illegal information.'  The FBI often uses this 'danger' as
justification to monitor the activities on these systems.  In reality,
however, BBSs transfer much less 'illegal information' than the phone
system."

Roberts statements are worth noting in light of the government's increased
interest in the marriage of criminal activity and electronic
communications.

A 455-page report issued by the President's Commission on Organized Crime,
dealing with drug abuse and traffiking cites that fact that crime has moved
into the high-tech arena.  The report states "To the extent that law
enforcement agencies' capabilities and equipment are inferior to those of
drug traffickers, immediate steps should be taken to rectify the
situation."  The report then recommends that _data-gathering_ efforts of
several agencies (including the FBI) should be tied together in one
"all-source intelligence and operations center."

The spirit of that document is being embraced by the long-distance phone
companies.  Tired of the multi-million dollar losses due to stolen or
illegally acquired access codes, these companies are circling the wagons in
a spirit of high-tech cooperative surveillance never before experienced in
the commercial world.

Quoting from a _Washington Post_ article, here's what Robert Fox, US
Sprint's director of security, says: "To shut down theft, the companies use
each other's security services and the help of local law enforcement
officials, the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Your major toll carriers may be competitors, but in this one instance we
share information and resourses.  We do everything from technical to
on-street surveillance."

Evidence that the FBI is actively monitoring BBSs also came to light in the
case of a Denver talk show host that was assassinated by a neo-Nazi group,
white supremacy group.

When it was discovered that Robert Miles, one of the defendants, was a
"computer wizard" the FBI began tracking his communications with other
neo-nazi groups;  the FBI found out, and mapped, an intricate network of
BBSs, by placing a bug in his home.  Where was bug placed?  Inside Miles'
modem.  Why there?  Simple.  Any calls he made with his modem would be to
other online sources; in this way, the FBI reasoned, they could chart the
(nationwide) network of neo-nazi BBSs, thus following their standing
tradition of "keeping tabs" on organizations, much like they did in the
'60s when they had agents infiltrate several radical organizations.

Any Problem Here?  =================

There are no laws prohibiting the FBI (or other agencies) from monitoring
the public message traffic on a BBS; the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986 protects private messages and privately stored files only.  But
what about an FBI agent monitoring a BBS solely for the purpose of
gathering information on the board's users?  Any problem here?

The former FBI agent I spoke with raised the concern that such casual
monitoring might be a violation of the 1968 Wiretap Act. "In order for a
wire tap, you have to get a court order.  Now if an FBI agent is monitoring
a BBS to gather information, that becomes an interesting question, because
there are very specific federal rules 'At what point does monitoring turn
into a wiretap-like act?'"

Good point.  And the upshot is: there are no rules.

Unless that agent is asking for private message traffic, he can, without
impunity, monitor, store, and otherwise manipulate your public messages as
he sees fit.

Roberts points out that a BBS with public access is fair game for any kind
of governmental snooping.  But there is a way to make such casual snooping
by a federal agent a crime.

"If you want your BBS readily accessible to the public but want to protect
against unwarranted monitoring, you have to provide a warning to
prospective users," says Roberts.  "It should read: 'This BBS is a private
system.  Only private citizens who are not involved in government or law
enforcement activities are authorized to use it.  The users are not
authorized to divulge any information gained from this system to any
government or law enforcement agency or employee.'"

This does two things.  It makes the board "private" in that the sysop
decides who gets access and who does not.  This isn't so unusual; most BBSs
now have some sort of validation anyway.  Second, it makes any kind of
monitoring by the FBI (or other agencies, such as the Secret Service) a
criminal offense, and forces them to use the established guidelines of
gaining information via a court ordered search warrant.  The warning also
protects you in another way: it stops "freelancers" from doing the Bureau's

Get Real =========

How real is the possibility of the FBI monitoring your BBS?  _Slim_.
Unless of course you happen to run a board dedicated to say, the Sanctity
Movement, or one that supports the Sandanistas or . . . any topic perceived
to be of a questionable nature by the FBI.

The stories provided here bear out, if nothing else, an increased interest
by the FBI in electronic messaging.  How extensive is the FBI's actual fact
gathering by monitoring BBSs?  No one knows really knows.  However, given
the history of Bureau, and the hard facts that crime in the information age
makes full use of all the technology it can get its hands on, it's a small
leap to believe that at least specific monitoring, of certain target
groups, is taking place.  (Given the manpower shortage of the Bureau, and
its overwhelming case load, I would find it hard to argue for large-scale
indiscriminate monitoring.)

Where does that leave you and me in all this?  Back to square one, watching
carefully what we say online.  If you're a member of a "controversial" BBS,
you might pass the concerns of Roberts on to your sysop.  If you are a
sysop, you might want to consider adding a bit of protection to the board .
. . for the rest of us.

***  CuD #3.06: File 6 of 6: Some Thoughts on Gov't Actions      ***
********************************************************************

In CuD 2.15, the moderators ask "What is the relationship between law
enforcement and the media?"  Later, they state "One of our goals is to
expand their literacy." I have combined (and slightly modified) these two
ideas and arrived at the central theme of this article.

THE NATURE OF THE BEAST

We of the CU tend to see our cyberworld as an extension of the real world.
Even the terminology in use among computer folks supports this.  By merely
sitting at your system and striking keys or manipulating your rodent, you
can "enter" another system, "take" or "move" files and programs.

Beyond the way we picture these things and the terminology we use, the
courts have enacted laws (at all levels of government) that give a legal
basis to the idea that the whole of a computer file is more than merely the
sum of its individual electronic bits.

Let's look at this idea from another angle.  No one will dispute that an
author should be able to copyright a book or that an inventor should be
able to patent a widget.  But what is a program (or text file) other than a
new means of representing the author's printed word or the work of a clever
inventor?  So, aside from a few subtle issues (thoughtfully discoursed by
the likes of Dark Adept, Offer Inbar, David Daniels, et al), we all agree
on the need for laws that protect electronic property and privacy just as
we have laws that protect personal property and privacy.

THE ABUSES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (LEAs)

As a self-styled libertarian, it makes me sick to read about the continued
abuses perpetrated by overzealous LEAs upon the members of the computing
community.  I am an optimist at heart and I find it hard to believe that
the people who work in these LEAs are as vindictive, or at least as
ignorant, as they at first glance appear.  As ever more reports of their
abuses mount, however, I find it hard to maintain a positive attitude.  No
reader of this journal needs to be reminded of all the LEA abuses of the
last few years.  Two acts, however, stand out in my mind as worth
recounting.

The first involves the seizure of, among many other things of questionable
use to an investigation, a laser printer at Steve Jackson Games.  The
reason given buy the US Secret Service (SS) for its confiscation was that
it had RAM.  One of two things must be true here.  Either the agents
serving the warrant were so ignorant of computer technology that they
believed that printer RAM could be used in illegal activities (in which
case they shouldn't have been working on this type of case), or the seizure
of the printer was committed as a punitive act against the EMPLOYER of a
SUSPECTED perpetrator of a criminal act.  If the latter is the case, and I
believe it is, then it is an utterly reprehensible (and possibly illegal)
act.

The second act that stands out in my mind is the use by the SS of a paid,
volunteer informant in the E911 case.  The details about the exact nature
of how the SS used this informant are not yet clear.  From what is
currently known, however (see CuD 3.02), it appears that the SS's use of
this miscreant borders very closely on entrapment.  I won't even get myself
started commenting on the kind of detestable SLIME that would *volunteer*
to due this kind of work.

AN EXAMINATION OF WHAT MOTIVATES LEA'S

To say that LEAs have been overzealous in their investigations of computer
crime is a gross understatement.  It won't do us any good merely to point
fingers at the first "bad guy" we see; identifying the culprit won't solve
the problem.  We need to look beyond the immediate problem; we need to look
at the underlying causes of the problem if we are to discover what we can
do to improve the situation.

LEAs are run by Directors who sit in Washington fighting for funds with
which to run their organizations.  Inasmuch, they are heavily influenced by
politicians on Capitol Hill who are, in turn, primarily influenced by
public opinion.  Now, on the subject of computer crime (among many others),
the public is predominantly influenced by the media.  Therein lies the
problem.

The media have seldom shied away from writing about a subject, even when
the facts are slim or when their understanding of an issue is nil.  This
becomes painfully apparent when you read articles about computer crime,
viruses, hackers, etc.

Until last year, I worked in security, concentrating on computer security.
I considered it a professional responsibility to read every article I could
find on topics relating to computer security.  With few exceptions, these
articles merely rehashed material from previous articles, perpetuated
misconceptions, and consistently fed the public hysteria that computer
hackers were hell-bent on destroying Western Civilization.

I am reminded of a line from the movie Ghostbusters.  After informing the
group that it would be "bad" to cross the beams on their nuclear
accelerators, Egon is asked to define "bad."  "Imagine every molecule in
your body exploding at the speed of light" he explains, "and all life as we
know it ceasing to exist."  It is in just such a manner that the media
portrays the issue of computer crime.

So that is the scenario:  A uninformed media has whipped an ignorant public
into a frenzy.  The public puts pressure on politicians (who are
genetically incapable of accepting responsibility) who, in turn, pressure
LEAs for results.  LEAs, no more computer literate than the media or
public, react by seeking immediate results.  Civil rights are trodden upon.

THE CRUX OF THE MATTER

The underlying theme in the scenario that I have described is ignorance or
a lack of even a minimal amount of computer literacy.  The media, the
public, and the LEAs are all ignorant of the technologies, as well as the
associated social issues, relevant to this matter.  These social issues in
particular can only be truly appreciated and understood by those with a
level of computer literacy that is plainly absent in most of the parties to
this problem.

I have now stretched the blame for this problem from the LEAs, to
politicians, and on to the media and public.  But the responsibility for
the problem does not entirely end there.  A good argument can be made that
we in the computing community, too, must take a measure of responsibility.
For too long we have been content to live in our own little piece of
cyberspace, enjoying the blinding pace of advances in computing
technologies, and ignoring the problems and issues that accompanied these
technologies.  We can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch.  These
issues are real, they affect us all, and we must all work to solve them.

WHAT WE CAN DO

So what can we, as individuals, do to help solve this problem?  If you
accept the premise that a lack of computer literacy (including the related
social issues) is the underlying problem, then the answer is clear.  It is
incumbent upon us to educate the uneducated.  In summing up his article in
CUD 2.15, Dark Adept enjoined us to help out the EFF, fight for our rights
using only legal means, not to hack security but to build public access
systems, and to expose the truth every chance we get.  I couldn't agree
with him more.

In his excellent book "The Cuckoo's Egg", Cliff Stoll makes the point that
the mere *impression* of computer crime endangers the thin veil of trust
upon which most networks are built.  We cannot be content with merely
maintaining current networks, we need to encourage creation of more and
larger networks.  We must lead exemplary electronic lives; we cannot
tolerate criminal activity or any other activity that puts at risk our
access to information networks.

Beyond this, however, we must strive to educate all others involved with
this issue:  the media, the public, and the government.  "But that's
everyone!", you say?  That's right.  We have to do our best to raise
everyone's level of computer literacy to the point where the average Joe
(or Jane) on the street would experience the same level of disgust as the
rest of us at acts such as the seizure of a laser printer.

IN SUMMARY

So there it is.  We must continue to discuss these issues (hats off to
CUD), keep our electronic delvings legal, and educate the world.  The first
two are easy.  Educating the world will be the real challenge.  To once
again quote Dark Adept, "The only way to conclusively affect the existence
of the underground is to affect society."
