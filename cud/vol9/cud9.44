Subject: File 1--Sen Murkowski's comments on S 771 (anti-spam bill)

  ((MODERATORS' NOTE: Following is the introductin to Senator
Murkowski's note, obtained from his homepage))

   S. 771
   The Unsolicited
   Commercial Email
   Choice Act of 1997

   I introduced S. 771, the Unsolicited Commercial Email Choice Act of
   1997, on May 21, 1997 to combat the growing cost to society of
   unsolicited bulk electronic mail messages. All Americans including
   Alaskans waste time and money having to receive and delete unsolicited
   commercial e-mails. Rural Americans pay transmission charges to
   receive this unwanted information. While the cost of these
   transmission charges may not be extreme, I fail to see why any
   American should bear any costs for receiving something they did not
   ask for.

   Please note that my bill does not ban such emails. Some may oppose
   this approach. However, I have no desire to set a precedent of the
   government telling you what you can and cannot see in your inbox. My
   bill merely provides a means for Internet users to filter out e-mails
   that they do not wish to receive by requiring that senders of
   unsolicited e-mails to include Advertisement as the first word of the
   subject line and that the real street address, e-mail address and a
   telephone number be contained within the body of the message. Routing
   information that accompanies the message must also be accurate.

   Internet users can request that their ISP filter out all such emails
   at their request. ISP's can also unilaterally block all such inbound
   messages. Consumers who are disappointed with a unilateral blocking
   policy of their ISP can always seek another ISP that allows such
   messages on its network. Per their ISP policy, Internet users can also
   choose to receive such messages and filter them individually by seeing
   the Advertisement tag and using the delete key or to stop them
   permanently from specific senders by sending a message to that effect
   to the original e-mail originating address.

   Some have raised the concern that an offshore marketer sending out
   junk e-mails would be beyond the reach of these restrictions. It is
   certainly true that no bill that Congress passes can reach directly
   beyond American territory. This does not mean, however, that S. 771
   would not have an impact upon marketers who mass e-mail from overseas.
   If the initiator of the message has a meaningful presence in the
   United States such as an office, parent company, bank to deposit
   funds, etc..., S. 771 would still reach these marketers under what's
   generally known as "long arm jurisdiction." I feel that most Americans
   would be hesitant to send money overseas to order from an item
   advertised in an unsolicited e-mail.

   As with most Internet users, I have no personal objection to the
   concept of unsolicited commercial e-mails if those who receive them
   actually want to receive them. Today, Internet users subscribe to
   electronic mailing lists of their own free will and whatever topic
   they choose.

   The Internet is an excellent tool for commerce though the use of
   commercial world wide web sites. However, America should be not be
   burdened by unwanted commercial e-mail.

   I welcome the Internet community's comments and suggestions on this
   bill. Please feel free to make them to me at
   commercialemail@murkowski.senate.gov

Subject: File 2--NASA Nabs Teen Computer Hacker

.c The Associated Press
Monday, June 2, 1997

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Delaware teen-ager who hacked his way into a
NASA web site on the Internet and left a message berating U.S.
officials is being investigated by federal authorities, agency
officials said Monday.

NASA Inspector General Robert Gross cited the incident - the most
recent example of a computer invasion of a NASA web site - as an
example of how the space agency has become ``vulnerable via the
Internet.''

"We live in an information environment vastly different than 20
years ago," Gross said in a written statement. "Hackers are
increasing in number and in frequency of attack."

In the latest case, the Delaware teen, whose name, age and
hometown were not released, altered the Internet web site for the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., according to
the statement from the computer crimes division of NASA's
Inspector General Office.

"We own you. Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when we practice to
deceive," the teen's message said, adding that the government
systems administrators who manage the site were "extremely
stupid."

The message also encouraged sympathizers of Kevin Mitnick, a
notorious computer hacker, to respond to the site. Mitnick was
indicted last year on charges stemming from a multimillion-dollar
crime wave in cyberspace.

The altered message was noticed by the computer security team in
Huntsville but the NASA statement did not mention how long the
message was available to the public or exactly when it was
discovered. NASA officials weren't made available to answer
questions about the event.

In the statement, NASA called the teen's hacking "a cracking
spree" and said it was stopped May 26 when his personal computer
was seized.

Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's office in Delaware and
Alabama are handling the case with NASA's computer crimes
division.

Last March, cyberspace invaders made their way into another NASA
web site and threatened an electronic terrorist attack against
corporate America. The group, which called itself ``H4G1S'' in
one message and ``HAGIS'' in another, also called for some
well-known hackers to be released from jail.

Engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
quickly noticed the change and took the page off the Internet
within 30 minutes.  NASA officials said the agency installed
electronic security measures designed to prevent a recurrence.

Subject: File 3--Phil Zimmermann on PGP's future, lawsuits, next steps

Source -  fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu
((Fwd from Phil Zimmerman))

Last month, Pretty Good Privacy Inc went through a  reorganization in
its top management.  We were spending too much money, too fast.  Tom
Steding was replaced by Phil Dunkelberger as the president of PGP, and
I handed over the chairman title to Jonathan Seybold, who had been, with
me, the original cofounder of the company.  Jonathan is devoting his time
to the business side of things, while I am focussing my attention on my
role as chief technology officer.

I have seen some speculation in some usenet newsgroups that these changes
were in some way connected with the fact that PGP was recently sued by RSA
Data Security over some dispute regarding royalties for use of the RSA
patent, which PGP holds a license to.  Let me set the record straight
on this.  There are sound business reasons why this shuffling of top
management occurred at PGP, and these reasons are known to all of our
employees.  The RSA lawsuit against PGP is absolutely not one of the
reasons, not even remotely.  I don't think shuffling top management is
a likely reaction for any company to take in response to a lawsuit, even
if the lawsuit had merit, which this one does not.  We fully expect the
RSA matter to be resolved in arbitration proceedings, in our favor.

I know that it is common practice for some companies to issue statements
to "spin" the story about certain events, sometimes at the expense of
truth.  This makes a lot of people understandably skeptical about such
explanations.  I do have responsibilities toward my company, but no
one could get me to deny a truth about the reasons for the restructuring.
The truth is, the restructuring had absolutely nothing at all to do with
the RSA lawsuit.

I would now like to announce that we will be releasing PGP 5.0 in mid-June.
It's in beta release right now on our web page (www.pgp.com).  In keeping
with my own dedication to personal freedom and privacy, we will be releasing
a freeware version for noncommercial use through MIT's web site
(web.mit.edu/pgp), just like in the old days before the company was formed.
And we do plan to publish the full PGP source code for Mac, Windows 95,
and Linux.

There are a lot of new exciting features, including automatic key lookups
from remote key servers on the Internet, which will likely result in the
rapid growth of a ready-made nationwide PGP public-key infrastructure,
on an unprecedented scale.  We are also encouraging the migration to new
public key algorithms in addition to RSA, namely the NIST Digital
Signature Standard (DSS), as well as Diffie-Hellman (Elgamal) keys.
We expect most of the new users to be using these new algorithms instead
of RSA, in part because they offer new features, better performance, and
better security for the same key sizes.  I hope that you will all join me
in this opportunity to move to these new algorithms, allowing everyone to
finally enjoy the use of public key cryptography without the encumberances
of patents.

Philip Zimmermann
Chief Technology Officer, PGP Inc.

Subject: File 4-- TEXANS SUE TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR INTERNET "SPAM"

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 TEXANS SUE TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR INTERNET "SPAM" CLAIMING
 ELECTRONIC TRESPASS AND NUISANCE

 	Austin, Texas, May 28, 1997:  Several Internet leaders in Austin,
 Texas filed a lawsuit yesterday afternoon against a company and an
 individual believed to be responsible for the mass distribution of
 junk mail over the Internet, also called "spam."  The suit claims that
 C.N. Enterprises and Craig Nowak of San Diego, California, sent
 thousands of electronic messages selling information on "Free Cash
 Grants" for $19.95.  The ad's content was not only misleading, the
 lawsuit claims, but the company's e-mail used a false return address,
 causing the electronic mail boxes of several Austin residents to
 overflow with returned copies of the junk mail.

 	According to the lawsuit, by using a false return address, those who
 send junk mail over the Internet can avoid the anger that results from
 this controversial practice.  They can also avoid dealing with the
 thousands of "bounce" messages that result from sending e-mail to
 invalid or outdated addresses.  "In effect," the lawsuit alleges,
 "C.N. Enterprises deliberately dumped tons of its electronic garbage
 and pollution" into the Austin residents' mailboxes.  The lawsuit
 claims that the use of false return addresses on junk e-mail, and the
 resulting fallout on those who own the addresses used, is illegal
 under the traditional common law causes of action of nuisance,
 trespass and conversion.

 	The lead plaintiff is Tracy LaQuey Parker, a leading Internet
 author, who owns the Internet domain name used by C.N. Enterprises
 without her permission.  Said Ms. Parker, "As a long-time Internet
 advocate, I am saddened that the goodwill spirit of the Internet is
 being spoiled by irresponsible individuals who forge their identity in
 order to make a quick buck.  There are plenty of examples of
 legitimate commercial uses of the Internet.  This isn't one of them."

 	Joining Ms. Parker in the lawsuit are her husband Patrick Parker and
 Peter Rauch, both Ms. Parker's business partners.  Also joining the
 suit are Zilker Internet Park, Ms. Parker's Internet service provider,
 which had to deal with the flood of messages stemming from the "spam,"
 and two active Texas Internet groups, the Texas Internet Service
 Providers Association (TISPA), a group of commercial Internet service
 providers, and EFF-Austin, a local Internet civil liberties
 organization.

 	John Quarterman, an owner of Zilker Internet Park, stated, "'Spam'
 is a large and rapidly growing problem which has cost Zilker Internet
 Park and many other ISPs and Internet users much time and money.  We
 have put many technical blocks in place to limit it.  With this
 lawsuit, we are taking the next step to help stop this abuse of the
 Internet."

 	TISPA and EFF-Austin joined the lawsuit in an effort to broaden the
 legal precedent beyond Ms. Parker's single Internet domain name,
 according to Gene Crick, TISPA's president.  "Increasingly, 'spammers'
 are using false return addresses to avoid taking full responsibility
 for the harm caused by their unsolicited commercial e-mail," Crick
 said.  "These forgeries dump huge volumes of unwanted junk mail onto
 Internet companies and their customers.  TISPA would like to see the
 court grant a broad and clear injunction prohibiting this practice."

 	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of LaQuey and the others by Pete
 Kennedy and Roger Williams of George, Donaldson & Ford, L.L.P. of
 Austin.  Among its other Internet related cases, the law firm has
 been
 involved in lawsuits against the United States Secret Service and
 Simon Leis, the Hamilton County (Ohio) Sheriff, over the seizure of
 private e-mail.

Subject: File 5--Purpose of CuD

Dear Editors,

I general, I have enjoyed skimming or reading through CuD.  Much
of what is contained in there tends to speak towards the
controversial issues which surround computing and society.  Many
good points have been raised and provocative and/or
thought-provoking articles are common.  I'm sorry to say though
that I've removed myself from the mailing list due to some brash
and poor-taste articles that you've allowed to be published.
Most recently the article (Cu Digest, #9.42) by Meeks.  His
hostile tone and language disgust me and make me wonder that if
such people are the main stream of the "movement" to combat
government control over the internet and information, can such a
battle be won?

You may guess that I tend to draw a middle of the road
perspective on censorship.  I believe that participants
(on-liners) need to be more civil than they now are, and that
those that aren't continue to destroy the reputation and ability
of the "real" users to use the information that is/could be out
there.
 I also believe that while there's nothing inherently wrong with
annonimity, it is often abused and used to cover up sick and
disgusting acts by those who are simply too cowardly or perverse
to reveal their true identity.

However, I have not found that the majority of your articles are
far off the mark or raise concerns that are not worthy to be
heard.  As a whole, I think that the information and service that
CuD provides is good.  I take note against articles such as
Meeks' which voice slanderous and degrading feelings or opinions
with the intent of putting down people, not policies.  I also do
not feel that his use of language is warranted or needed.

There are real issues to deal with as technology becomes more
readily available to the world.  It's no longer the play ground
of the select few who can learn how to program or spend endless
hours on-line.  And as this technology and it's uses begin to
demand more information and becomes more intimately a part of our
lives, it begins to become the responsibility of those that
create it to do all that they can to educate the users to it's
proper use.  Computers are becomming the tool of non-programmers
(and I think that some programmers find that irksome).  The
governments are simply responding (fairly well I think) to
something that they don't understand well but that the public
demands.  I think it is our charge as the creators of technology
to promote and insure it's proper use, it's ethical use, and do
all that we can to support actions against using it to hurt
others or to promote illeagal behavior.  I would like to see CuD
begin to become more proactive in the fight for the proper use of
current and developing technology.  I would like to see CuD
support ethical uses of technology instead of complaining about
cyber-cops doing their best to crack down against child
pornography, etc.  True, there are some censorship activities
that are going much too far.  But I think that we need to realize
that there are malicious people who choose to use it as a weapon;
we should do what we can to stop that.  If you will work to
better edit the articles you publish, and begin to look into the
issues I've state above, pleae let me know as I will want to
resume my readings.

Thank you.

They could issue a european warrent which could result in your
arrest if you travel to any country in european. An american who
was selling nazi matarial by mail to residents of Germany was
arrested in Denmark at the request of Germany authorities.

The US is supposely considering changes to its laws to allow one
to be prosecuted here for "morals" offenses committed abroad. So
if you violate morals laws in Germany, you could faces charges in
US, especially with hot botton issues like child porn.

Also, they don't need to convict to win. Just having someone
accused can result in that person losing their job and/or being
run out of town.  Having to fight an international criminal
charge could drive most people into bankruptcy.

In Canada and using a .com address, as you can see from the return
address in this message, I too get spams from Cyberpromotions,
etc. and cannot see how either of these bills will enable ME to
stop the spams.  There seems to be nothing in either of these
bills that makes it clear that Canadians can avail themselves of
the right to demand removal from the spammer's lists or avail
themselves of the remedy provided re the $500.

Therefore the question:  Is it possible for someone NOT in the US
to stop spams from the US using either of these vehicles, should
either pass the Congress?

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Significant milestones will be crossed in the field of Internet and
networked applications security in the coming year. Security and
communications vendors are expected to announce the availability of
products that will satisfy several of the most sought-after and urgently
needed security requirements for secure networking, including:  strong
authentication for core Internet applications (e.g., DNS), new methods for
defending intranets and extranets against intrusion, hardware-based
cryptographic protection of data in modems and remote access servers, new
techniques affording stronger authentication for remote and roaming access
to enterprise networks over the public Internet, data confidentiality
through the use of encryption of Internet Protocol payloads, data
confidentiality for NOS protocols through the use of encrypted tunnels
through the public Internet, and alternatives for digital key management,
escrow and recovery.

Many of these features will be based on de facto Internet standards, and
others will be based on innovative or bleeding edge technology.  With these
issues come certain controversial problems, such as restrictions and
control, and the controversy should not be dismissed as being of concern to
academics and security professionals only.  During this teleconference,
industry experts will discuss the subject of security and some of the
issues involved in securing networks, and answer questions regarding the
controversies involved.

The Interop Security Symposium is a new Interop event, officially being
announced June 17, to be held conjunction with NetWorld+Interop 97 Atlanta,
October 6-10, 1997.  In addition to the sessions and presentations in the
Interop Security Symposium, there will be a hands-on, educational Security
Hot Spot demonstration on the NetWorld+Interop interactive show floor,
emphasizing authentication systems, encryption, access controls and
auditing systems.

The teleconference is open to press and analysts, and time will be allotted
for questions from the teleconference audience.

It's time for the inevitable - the sequel to 1994's Hackers On Planet Earth
conference. If you missed that event, you'll feel even worse if you miss this
one! Don't let that happen. Beyond Hope will be everything HOPE was and
probably a lot more.

SPEAKERS/PANELS

So far we're lining up people for panels on social engineering, encryption,
surveillance, PCS/GSM technology, legal issues, hacker ex-prisoners, "pirate"
radio, the media, boxing, and a whole lot more. Our biggest worry at this
point is figuring out how to fit it all into three days. If you have ideas,
contact us using the methods below.

THE NETWORK

Even though we only had a 28.8 link to the outside world at the 1994 HOPE,
we still had a lot of fun networking all our computers together. This time
things will be different. Our link to the net will be faster than ever - at
the very least a T1 - and we will also be experimenting with video links to
the Hacking In Progress (HIP) conference going on in Holland. Plus we'll have
an amazing internal network of old and new machines. Bring your computer and
whatever toys you have! As in 1994, all attendees will get an account on
our hope.net machine. Valuable prizes will be awarded to those who
hack root.

LOGISTICS

It all takes place starting Friday evening, August 8th, running until Sunday
night, August 10th at the Puck Building in New York City, on the corner
of Houston and Lafayette Streets. The main part of the conference begins at
noon on Saturday, with registration starting at 10 am. However, you will also
be able to register Friday evening beginning at 6 pm and help us set up the
network for the weekend. There will be a special 2600 meeting beginning
at 5 pm on Friday at the Citicorp Center, located at 53rd and Lexington.
To get to the conference from the meeting, take the #6 train downtown to
Bleecker Street. Follow the signs and portents. ** NOTE: There will also
be a TAP reunion at Eddie's on Waverly and Mercer - if you were part of the
old TAP crowd, keep checking our web site (www.hope.net) for specifics! **

THE NEIGHBORHOOD

The Puck Building is in one of the liveliest sections of Manhattan, next to
Greenwich Village, Chinatown, Little Italy, and SoHo within easy walking
distance of Bleecker Street, Broadway, Avenue A, and St. Mark's Place. We
will have a full guide of places and Hope-related activities on our web site
and at the conference.

TRAVEL

There are many cheap ways to get to New York City in August but you may want
to start looking now, especially if you're coming from overseas. Travel
agencies will help you for free. Also, look in various magazines like
Time Out, Village Voice, local alternative weeklies, and travel sections of
newspapers. Buses, trains, and carpools are great alternatives to domestic
flights. Keep in touch with the update sites for more information as it
comes in.

GETTING TO THE SITE

>From the airports: From all three airports (Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark) you
can either take a cab or bus to the city - from Kennedy you can take a free
bus to the subway and take the A train into Manhattan for $1.50. To get to
the Puck Building in this manner, take the A train to West 4th in Manhattan
and transfer to a Brooklyn bound B, D, F, or Q for one stop to
Broadway/Lafayette. If you take a bus, see the directions below from the
Port Authority.

By car: We'll assume you can find New York City on your own. Once you're
actually over the bridge or through the tunnel, head for Houston Street,
just south of 1st Street. The conference takes place on the southeast corner
of Houston and Lafayette. There are parking garages in the neighborhood and
many nearby streets allow free parking from Friday evening through the weekend.

to a Brooklyn bound B, D, F, or Q for one stop to Broadway/Lafayette. From
Grand Central, take the #6 subway downtown to Bleecker Street.

By bus: From the Port Authority Bus Terminal, take the A train downtown to
West 4th, transfer to a Brooklyn bound B,D, F, or Q for one stop to

WHERE TO STAY

The Puck Building is not a hotel, which we believe will make the conference
itself a lot more interesting. We will be compiling a list of places to stay
in the city, ranging in price from $40 a night on up. So far, we suggest the
following: the YMCA at 215 W 23rd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues
(212-741-9226) - rooms start at $40 and there are no age restrictions;
Off Soho Suites Hotel on 11 Rivington Street. This hotel is only a couple of
blocks away from the Puck Building and you can get European style suites,
complete with kitchens, for a low price. A suite for 2 is $89, for 4 it's
$149. They also have a location on East 12th Street off 3rd Avenue. Both of
these hotels don't have a huge number of rooms so we suggest making
reservations early (212-979-9808); Howard Johnson on 429 Park Avenue South
between 29th and 30th Streets (212-532-4860) - rooms start at around $100
a night; and Holiday Inn at 132 Lafayette Street (212-966-8898) - rooms are
around the $150 level. There are also youth hostels, bed and breakfasts,
and hundreds of other hotels in the city. This is only a preliminary list -
check with us for more details as the conference draws closer. You should
make reservations no closer than three weeks prior to the conference.
Remember, the cost of a room is lessened significantly if you split it with
other people. Bring sleeping bags to increase your flexibility.

WHAT WE NEED

Ideas, people, computers, technology of all sorts.

HOW TO STAY UPDATED

There are many ways to keep updated as preparations get underway. We will be
posting updates on our office phone line - (516) 751-2600 - as well as
the 2600 voice BBS - (516) 473-2626. The official Beyond Hope website can be
reached at www.hope.net and updates will also be found on the 2600 website at
www.2600.com. On the websites you'll find details on how to be part of the
Beyond Hope mailing lists. Email info@hope.net for the latest information,
travel@hope.net for cheap fares and advisories, tech@hope.net for technical
questions and suggestions, speakers@hope.net for anyone interested in
speaking at the conference, and vol@hope.net for those of you who want to
volunteer to help. On usenet, read alt.2600.hope.announce for the latest
announcements, alt.2600.hope.d for an ongoing discussion about the
conference, and alt.2600.hope.tech for technical setup discussion.

REGISTRATION

The cost for pre-registration is $20 for the weekend. While we hope to keep
the cost at $20 for those who register at the conference, we may wind up
filling the place up (capacity is only around 2,000 after all) and, in that
event, pre-registrants will have priority. So send us $20, your name and
address, and we'll send you a pass that will get you in without a hassle or
a wait. Make checks payable to 2600. The address is Beyond Hope,
c/o 2600 Magazine, PO Box 848, Middle Island, NY 11953. Don't send us
anything after July 15, 1997 to ensure that your pass is received in time.
Special Offer: FREE ADMISSION for anyone coming to Beyond Hope from
overseas with a foreign passport. North Americans not eligible.
