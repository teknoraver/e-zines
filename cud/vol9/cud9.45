 The following (translated) article is from "Il Mattino" of Naples. It
 concerns "Decoder", one of the most relevant magazines in the Italian
 antagonist landscape.

 This raving article is against "Decoder" and the
 alternative Italian telematics. It is the proof that all the
 repressive legislation passed or under way to "regulate" the net will
 become instruments against freedom of expression more broadly. For
 those who didn't know it, the article mentioned concerns a strip by
 the famous English artist, Graham Harwood ("Decoder", No. 8), on the
 issue of violence on children. A harsh strip, ruthless, but whose
 only goal was to make people reason on the origins of violence
 against weaker human beings. But when power becomes blind, it hits in
 any form, it becomes abuse, it becomes censorship, and it hits
 everything and everyone.

 If this was not so gloomy for the future prospects it envisages, we
 could even laugh at it, but BEWARE, because this article -which the
 journalist who attacks us and the right to stay anonymous was not
 brave enough to sign- seems to anticipate a new repressive clampdown
 on Italian networks and their activists.

 As "Decoder" we will seek for advice from our lawyers to try and do
 something -we do not accept being used to the ends of newspapers'
 manipulation- and we INVITE all the comrades, brothers and sisters
 from telematic communities to express solidarity, to activate on
 these issues, and build a united front against repression.

      -------

 "Il Mattino" 28 May 1997

 The cyber-race and its prophets. See under "violence"

 There is also a magazine ,"Decoder", in glossy paper: it preaches the
 destruction of all rules

 ROME. A bunch of copies on adjunct attorney's Italo Ormanni.
 Disgusting images of violence on children accompanied by a language
 that is abusive in itself. It is not a porn magazine, of those some
 guys get behind closed doors. It's a glossy paper, underground they
 say, who claims to change the world. An organ of ideological
 struggle, one may say party-like, if we can call this way a group
 which is sailing on the Net preaching the destruction of all rules.
 And what is more shocking, more destructive than sanctifying violence
 on children?

 Ormanni, the statutes in his hands, could only do one thing. He asked
 to the police's telecommunication operative branch director, Maria
 Cristina Ascenzi, if the requisites existed to sue someone for under-
 age persons' exploitation. But it came out that those sick images
 are the outcome of computer-aided elaborations. The crime disappears,
 at least for current laws, but a chilling discovery is confirmed:
 pedophily is not only stuff for a-social, depraved people: it is
 used, if you pass this concept, as a tool of struggle, a ram's head
 against the bases of society. Going through "Decoder"'s pages is like
 have a walk into a frenzy: a summary of the cyberpunk's "philosophy"
 is that any rule must tumble down. And that anyone do what they want,
 totally unnamed.

 Being strong or weak, being the animal that eats or the one who gets
 eaten, does not matter. But this is not said because anyone of these
 cyberphilosophers feel, tacitly, the eating animal. One of the most
 notable parts of this vision of the world supported even through
 pedophily is the coming birth of a cyber-race improved by computer.
 And all, which they imagine so original and part of the new times,
 inequivocably smacks like a rotten carcass.

 No signatures, only proclamations. The authors don't let people look
 in their faces. Only battle nicknames. It's the rule, on the Net.
 This in the lefty circles who are seeking on the Net for alternatives
 to the old social centre (whom detectives call "antagonist"), like in
 these groups defined, instead, as rightist. Among so many living
 presences, curious, even provoking, then, you can also find anti-
 everything propaganda, desecrating by choice. Legislation that is now
 going to pass in Parliament provides for very hard penalties for
 everyone produces pornographic material representing under-age
 persons. Also virtual pedophily, then, might be punished, as a non-
 value and an "exaltation" of a crime. Until now the police, who can
 anyway point and prosecute those inciting to racial hatred, can just
 wait and see.

Islands in the Clickstream:
                      No More Pencils, No More Books?


     We are all children of our times.
     We frame our worlds as they are given to us by our language
and the structures of our education. The frame is invisible until
there is a change so pervasive that we see by contrast what we
once took for granted. It's like the terminator on the moon, the
line between darkness and light where the mountain ranges are
thrown into relief.
     I did not experience the education I received growing up in
America in the 1950s and 1960s as a choice. It's what education
was.
     In the same way, becoming an "adolescent" was simply a fact
of growing up, a universal stage of development. But adolescence
is really a modern invention. The word was first used in 1904.
The same is true of "childhood" which was really invented by the
Victorians.
     In the United States, the expectation that adults will
graduate from high school is a fairly recent development, a
twentieth-century phenomena.
     "School" as we know it is a direct result of the printing
press.  Collections of benches in a central building on which to
sit and read are a recent development. Learning had universally
been accomplished through apprenticeship. Young people worked
beside adults, learning by doing. Most never left the village in
which they were born.
     The fact of textbooks and universal literacy made necessary
a prolonged period of time called "adolescence" that postponed
adulthood. During that time we learned the art of symbol
manipulation. We learned to internalize typographical symbols and
be "reading people." Learning to read transformed who we were and
how we understood our lives as possibilities for action.
     The process was at least as important as the content.
     We called that process "education."

     Today the structures of education are out of joint with the
structures of adulthood. That's why so many businesses are
educating workers. More education takes place today in conference
rooms, meeting rooms in hotels, and via remote telepresence and
onsite computer-assisted learning than in classrooms. The need
for continuous lifelong education is now an unquestioned
assumption.

     Apple flooded schools with computers, but didn't provide
teachers who knew what to do with them. My consulting with
schools tells me that money is often budgeted to buy computers,
but seldom budgeted for the years of training needed to re-
program teachers to use them effectively.
     I know a fourth grade teacher who was supposed to teach
computers but didn't know how to turn them on. She asked her
class, "Who knows how?" Hands waved in the air. She turned the
task over to the students and hid behind her desk while they
showed each other what to do.
     She called it "empowerment."
     But she couldn't hide forever. So she asked her three
brightest students secretly to teach her after school how to use
computers. Then she could teach the students how to use
computers.
     That teacher's situation as an officer in a command-and-
control hierarchy who does not know as much as the people she
teaches is analogous to a manager asked to supervise younger
workers who understand computer technology and its uses far
better than she does.
     Older managers as well as older teachers must learn from
younger adults as well as teach them. The wisdom of experience is
relevant, but relevant in a different way. Command-and-control
behaviors do not make for good coaching.
     That teacher, like many managers, learned that she still had
authority, but authority that had to be exercised in a collegial
way. Leadership is exercised in a network by implementing a
vision, not by dominating and controlling. Power is exercised in
a network by participating and contributing.
     That teacher knew, at least, how to get out of the way, but
that didn't make her a coach. She needed to learn how to be
present but not controlling, available but not directive. Like
the best computer assisted learning, good coaches provide
information not at the convenience of the curriculum but when
learners are most teachable.

     Naturally the fact of computer technology has been
threatening to many schools. Some responded to the challenge by
taking away all the computers and locking them up in a room. They
call it a "computer lab" and let the kids in there an hour a day.
     Imagine being a teacher when pencils were invented. You pass
out pencils and watch as the children discover that pencils can
do anything because a pencil is a symbol manipulating machine.
Children can write stories, do math, reflect on history. Afraid
you're no longer needed, you collect the pencils and lock them in
a Pencil Lab, letting the children use them an hour a day. The
rest of the time they write with rocks on slabs of broken
concrete.

     In preparation for a speech for a school district in
northern Illinois recently, I was told that the large
corporations in which most of their students worked gave the
district good grades in much of what they were teaching, but not
in preparing young people for cooperative learning and cross-
disciplinary teamwork. When I asked what they meant by
"cooperative learning," I realized that in *my* day it was called
... cheating.
     A stand-alone human being who learns and works by themselves --
as I was taught to do -- is a brain in a bottle.

     The structures of education, like the structures of work,
are moving through a sea-change. Symptoms include:

     + Rising drop-out rates. Racial minorities, the canaries in
the coal mine of society, die first. The growing irrelevance of
school to life in the real world was experienced first in
ghettos. Now blue-collar workers and middle-aged managers are
feeling the pain so it's a "crisis."

     + A growing "black market" in education. We give lip-service
to traditional structures but barter for "educational goods" on
the job and over the Internet, in the global marketplace.

     + Businesses are becoming centers of education, not because
they want to, but because they must. McDonald's teaches
politeness and civility because the traditional structures of
society no longer do the job. The budget for training in many
businesses exceeds the budgets of local school districts. Some
companies have started their own colleges and graduate studies
because schools do not generate people with the skills and
knowledge they need.

     + Conscientious teachers who can't see the forest for the
trees redouble their efforts. They become exhausted , working
harder and harder, but it's like drinking from a dribble glass.
The gears of the system don't mesh with the real world. Veterans
count the days until retirement. Burn-out abounds.

     + "Work-to-school" programs grow as apprenticeship is re-
engineered for the 21st century.

     Is there hope? Of course. The solutions begin with
understanding the depths of the transformation we are
experiencing and asking questions relevant to our real lives. The
process of finding answers together will generate the security we
need to remain effective during revolutionary times.

Subject: File 3--'Amateur Action' update

((MODERATORS' NOTE: A full background on the Amateur Action BBS
case, including its history and the text of relevant legal
documents, can be found in the CuD archives at:
http://www.soci.niu.edu/~aabbs/aabbs.html

==============

Source - fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

Background:  Robert and Carleen Thomas ran an adult-oriented
bulletin board system from their home in California.  Prosecutors in
Tennesee in 1994 downloaded allegedly obscene pictures of sexual
acts and charged them. Of course, they were applying *their*
"community standards" for obscenity to his California business.
They were found guilty and sentenced to 37 months.  While that case
was on trial, Federal officials in Utah heard about and looked into
it.  They downloaded pictures of "nude and semi-nude children" and
charged Thomas in Utah with distributing child pornography, although
there is no evidence any Utahan except the official had ever done
so.  Thomas pled guilty to 1 of 16 charges and appealed alleging
double jeopardy.

The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the decision of the Utah
District Court.  No double jeopardy because the individual photos are
different from those which were tried in the other cases.  Thomas is
serving a 26-month sentence on this count, concurrently with the
other sentence.  The opinion does not appear to be on the Emory
University web site which tracks these things.


Moral: anyone who distributes content nationally continues to be
subject to prosecution in each and every locale under prevailing
community standards.  If your content is objectionable to the most
small-minded folk anywhere in the US, it would be wise to refrain
from publishing it on the internet or other comparable medium.
Prosecutions continue to apply local "contemporary community
standards" to obscenity prosecutions, but in meeting the Miller test,
they are permitted to demonstrate that the material has prurient
appeal to someone else.  In other words, offensive to you, sexually
appealing to anyone anywhere.

For example, if space aliens landed tomorrow and their pornography
consisted of pictures that looked like cat vomit, prosecutors could
present evidence that the material is prurient with regard to space
aliens, patently offensive to you (cat vomit, you know), and lacking
in serious literary value to you (obviously) and you would therefore
conclude that the material was obscene.


     [v]enue for federal obscenity prosecutions lies "in any district
     from, through, or into which" the allegedly obscene material
     moves, according to 18 U.S.C. section 3237. This may result in
     prosecutions of persons in a community to which they have sent
     materials which is obscene under that community's standards
     though the community from which it is sent would tolerate the
     same material.

     United States v. Peraino, 645 F.2d 548, 551 (6th Cir. 1981)


So even if you refrain from sending material to Tennesee residents,
an internet router can make that decision for you by sending data
packets through the state.  What a great piece of law.

TOKYO (June 6, 1997 11:43 a.m. EDT) - Japan, the United States and
European nations will hold an unprecedented ministerial meeting next
month to study ways to restrict obscenity on the Internet and regulate
electronic commerce, it was reported Friday.

The meeting in Bonn July 6-8 will focus on measures to crack down on
obscene and violent pictures on the Internet, Jiji Press quoted
informed sources as saying.

It will also discuss universal criteria for encoding information in
electronic commerce to protect private information, Jiji said.

Japan will be represented by the posts and telecommunications
minister, Hisao Horinouchi, the sources said.

                             <. . .>

But in all this furor over spam, I've been puzzled by something.
Why not as much indignation over paper mail?  I told someone last
week that if I could take all the paper junk that is stuffed in
my postal mailbox (which I am required to physically sort for
recycling), and put it in my e-mailbox, I would flick it into the
ether with just as much ease as I do the electronic variety.  Two
years ago, after sending written requests to about 150 paper junk
mailers, I was only successful at stopping the flow from half of
them.  The others required one or more followup calls, many of
which had lame excuses for not complying with my request to stop.
And it appears that I have no legal recourse.

A handful have been so non-responsive (Honda, Godiva Chocolates
and Starbucks come to mind) that I've considered organizing
boycotts of their products by like-minded individuals.  Ah, but
I've got a life.  At least I know that *I* won't be buying their
products.

This isn't to say I'm unsympathetic; I've been the victim of some
idiotic spam attacks myself, and I'm still receiving junk from
email lists that accept automatic registration without any sort
of authentication - an administrative practice which borders on
negligence at this late date.

          O'REILLY RELEASES "JAVA FUNDAMENTAL CLASSES REFERENCE"

SEBASTOPOL, CA--"Java Fundamental Classes Reference," the latest title
in O'Reilly & Associates' Java documentation series, provides complete
reference documentation on the core Java 1.1 classes.

"Java Fundamental Classes Reference" goes beyond a standard reference
manual. In addition to detailed descriptions of classes and methods, it
offers tutorial-style explanations of the important classes in the Java
core API. The first section of the book includes chapters that describe
the ins and outs of strings and related classes, effective thread
programming, and the use of the I/O classes. These chapters also
include lots of sample code, so that readers can learn by example.

The core classes addressed in "Java Fundamental Classes Reference"
contain architecture-independent methods that serve as Java's gateway
to the real world, by providing access to resources such as the network
and the host filesystem. These classes also include utilities for
working with strings, I/O streams, mathematical functions, vectors, and
hash tables. The book covers the classes that comprise the java.lang,
java.io, java.net, java.util, java.text, java.math, java.lang.reflect,
and java.util.zip packages. These classes provide general-purpose
functionality that is fundamental to every Java application.

"Java Fundamental Classes Reference" describes Version 1.1 of the Java
Development Kit (JDK) and includes:

 - Easy-to-use reference material on every core Java class
 - Tutorial-style explanations of important classes and examples that
   demonstrate their functionality
 - Detailed coverage of all the essential classes in java.lang,
   including Object, String, and Thread
 - Descriptions of all the I/O classes provided in the java.io package,
   including all of the new Reader, Writer, and object serialization
   classes in Java 1.1
 - Material on using the classes in java.util effectively
 - Coverage of all the networking classes in the java.net package

"Java Fundamental Classes Reference" is meant to be used in conjunction
with the "Java AWT Reference." Together, these two reference manuals
cover all of the classes in the Java core API. "Java Language
Reference" completes O'Reilly's core Java documentation set by
providing a detailed reference of the Java programming language.
These manuals comprise the definitive set of Java 1.1
documentation--essential reference for any serious Java programmer.

O'Reilly's Java series also includes a tutorial, "Exploring Java," and
single-topic programming books that provide in-depth information on
critical topics, an approach the company has perfected in the past ten
years with their highly successful Nutshell Handbooks. "Java Virtual
Machine," "Java Threads," and "Java Network Programming" are the first
books on advanced programming topics. Upcoming Java programming books
include "Developing Java Beans" (6/97) and "Database Programming with
JDBC and Java" (7/97).

Copyright  1997 Reuter Information Service

WASHINGTON (June 11, 1997 00:08 a.m. EDT) - The U.S. Agriculture
Department's Foreign Agricultural Service shut down access to its
internet home page Tuesday after a major security breach was
discovered, a department aide said.

"It's a big, huge problem," Ed Desrosiers, a computer specialist
in USDA's Farm Service Agency, told Reuters. "We can't guarantee
anything's clean anymore."

Someone broke into system and began "sending out a lot of
messages" to other "machines" on the internet, Desrosiers said.

The volume of traffic was so great, "we were taking down machines"
and began receiving complaints, he said.

"It's not worth our time to try to track down" the culprit,
Desrosiers said. "Instead, we're just going to massively increase
security."

A popular feature on the FAS home page is the search function for
"attache reports," which are filed by overseas personnel and
provide assessments on crop conditions around the world. Although
not official data, the reports provide key information that goes
into USDA's monthly world supply-and-demand forecasts.

It could be next week before the page is open to outside users
again, Desrosiers said.

FRENCH INTERNET SUIT DISMISSED
ENGLISH-ONLY WEB SITE ILLEGAL, GROUPS CHARGE

   The first test of whether France's disputed language law
applies to the Internet ended in a fiasco Monday when a court
threw out the case against an overseas branch of Georgia Tech on
a technicality.

   Two state-approved watchdogs promoting the use of the French
language had filed a complaint against the Georgia Institute of
Technology's French campus for using English only on its Web
site.

   The plaintiffs, Defense of the French Language and Future of
the French Language, accused Georgia Tech Lorraine of breaking a
1994 law requiring all advertising in France to be in French.

   The Paris police court dismissed the lawsuit, saying the two
private groups should have notified a public prosecutor first.

   The legislation, named after then-Culture Minister Jacques
Toubon, was part of a battle to protect the tongue of Moliere and
Racine from the growing international use of English.
