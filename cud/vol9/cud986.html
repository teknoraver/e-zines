New Internet Censorship Bill Ignores Landmark Supreme Court Ruling

New legislation aimed at banning online material deemed &quot;harmful to
minors&quot; would run roughshod over the landmark Supreme Court decision
affirming free speech on the Internet, ACLU staff members announced
Thursday.

The ACLU, which led the successful battle to defeat the unconstitutional
Communications Decency Act (CDA), said S. 1482, like the CDA, would
restrict adults from accessing constitutionally protected speech. The
bill was introduced last week by Sen. Dan Coats, R-IN, an original
sponsor of the ill-fated CDA.

Under the bill, commercial online distributors of material deemed
&quot;harmful to minors&quot; could be punished with up to six months in jail and
a $50,000 fine. The definition of &quot;distributor&quot; could include the
virtual bookstore amazon.com or a promotional site for a Hollywood
movie, as well as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Microsoft
and America Online, the ACLU said. And unlike the CDA, the statute
applies only to web sites, not to chat rooms, e-mail or news groups.

&quot;By claiming that the bill addresses only web sites involved in
commercial distribution, Senator Coats says he is 'hunting with a
rifle' but in fact, he has lobbed another virtual grenade into the
heart of the Internet&quot; said Ann Beeson, an ACLU National Staff Attorney
and member of the legal team that defeated the CDA.

Any business merely displaying material without first requiring a credit
card or other proof of age could be found liable under the statute,
which criminalizes commercial distribution of words or images that could
be deemed &quot;harmful to minors,&quot; even if no actual sale is involved,
Beeson said.

&quot;This is the equivalent of having to pay a fee every time you want to
browse in the bookstore or watch a trailer for an R-rated movie,&quot; Beeson
said. &quot;As the Supreme Court noted in its landmark decision, requiring a
credit card or other age verification would impose a severe financial
and
logistical burden, even on commercial websites.&quot;

The ACLU said there were serious constitutional problems as well with
the bill's definition of &quot;harmful to minors.&quot; In addition to using a
vague definition of what constitutes &quot;harmful material,&quot; the bill does
not make any distinction between material that may be harmful to a
six-year-old but valuable for a 16-year-old, such as safer-sex
information, said Chris Hansen, an ACLU Senior Staff Attorney and member
of the Reno v. ACLU legal team.

Further, Hansen pointed out, unlike other &quot;harmful to minors&quot; statutes
that have been upheld in the courts, the bill does not define whose
community standard will be used to determine what material is harmful.

&quot;Invariably, those who decide what is harmful to a minor are going to be
the least tolerant members of a given community -- such as the group in
Oklahoma who sought to remove the award-winning film The Tin Drum from
local libraries and video stores,&quot; Hansen said.

The Supreme Court's landmark decision striking down the CDA was issued
on June 26 of this year, 16 months after the law was enacted and the
ACLU filed its challenge.

In a ringing affirmation of online free speech, the Court said that 'the
interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a democratic society
outweighs any theoretical but unproven benefit of censorship.'

&quot;While we rejoiced in the Supreme Court's decision last June, we knew
that the battle was not yet over,&quot; said Solange Bitol, legislative
counsel on
First Amendment issues for the ACLU's Washington National Office.
&quot;When Congress returns to session in the New Year, we will be ready for
Round Two in the battle to protect our free speech rights.&quot;

       States of America in Congress assembled,



  SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB OF
  MATERIAL THAT IS HARMFUL TO MINORS.



   (a) PROHIBITION-



        (1) IN GENERAL- Section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47
            U.S.C. 223) is amended--



             (A) by redesignating subsections (e), (f), (g), and (h) as
                 subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i), respectively; and



             (B) by inserting after subsection (d) the following new
                 subsection (e):



   `(e)(1) Whoever in interstate or foreign commerce in or through the
       World Wide Web is engaged in the business of the commercial
       distribution of material that is harmful to minors shall restrict
       access to such material by persons under 17 years of age.



   `(2) Any person who violates paragraph (1) shall be fined not more
       than $50,000, imprisoned not more than six months, or both.



   `(3) In addition to the penalties under paragraph (2), whoever

       paragraph, each day of violation shall constitute a separate
       violation.



   `(5) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this subsection
       that the defendant restricted access to material that is harmful
       to minors by persons under 17 years of age by requiring use of a
       verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult
       personal identification number or in accordance with such other
       procedures as the Commission may prescribe.



   `(6) This subsection may not be construed to authorize the Commission

            communication, picture, image, graphic image file, article,
            recording, writing, or other matter of any kind that--



             `(i) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to
                 a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;



             `(ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently
                 offensive way with respect to what is suitable for
                 minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual
                 contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual
                 acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and



             `(iii) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or
                 scientific value.



        `(B) The terms `sexual act' and `sexual contact' have the
            meanings assigned such terms in section 2246 of title 18,
            United States Code.'.



        (2) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Subsection (g) of such section, as so
            redesignated, is amended by striking `(e), or (f)' and
            inserting `(f), or (g)'.



   (b) AVAILABILITY ON INTERNET OF DEFINITION OF MATERIAL THAT IS HARMFUL
       TO MINORS- The Attorney General, in the case of the Internet web
       site of the Department of Justice, and the Federal Communications

CYBERPATROL: The Friendly Censor

&quot;We didn't create our product for libraries,&quot; admits
Susan Getgood, director of marketing for Microsystems
Inc., distributors of CyberPatrol blocking software.
But Microsystems is in business to make a profit, and when
libraries come knocking on the door asking to buy
the product, the company will sell it to them.

Today, CyberPatrol is installed in at least
two major public library
systems, in Boston, Ma. and Austin, Tx. In the
former, after a bitter debate, it was installed on
terminals for use by people under 18 only.
In the latter, it was installed
on  all terminals; the library is now, after
many months, considering a pilot program to offer uncensored
Internet access to adults, on one out of fifty terminals.

News coverage of the blocking software industry has been
dominated by the antics of Brian Milburn, president
of rival Solid Oak Software, distributors of Cybersitter,
the product which, in pursuit of a
fundamentalist agenda, blocked the National Organization for
Women among numerous other sites. By contrast, Microsystems
has appeared to be the most reasonable and flexible of
blocking software providers. It maintains a review board
which meets every two months to review its blocking policies
and which includes members of the gay community. When authors
of web pages have complained to Microsystems that their sites
were blocked, Microsystems has frequently apologized for the
error and unblocked the sites in the product's next update.

I was one of those authors. In February of this year, I was
informed that CyberPatrol blocked the pages pertaining to
my book, Sex, Laws and Cyberspace (Henry Holt, 1996),
<a href="http://www.spectacle.org/freespch">http://www.spectacle.org/freespch</a>.
I wrote an angry letter to Microsystems and received the
following reply:

&quot;Hi Jonathan,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
This site was blocked in error.
I have removed this site from the CyberNOT list.
This change will take effect
with the next build of the CyberNOT list, by next Tuesday.
Please accept my
apologies for any inconvenience this has caused.

Debra Greaves
Internet Research Supervisor&quot;

At the time, the Boston Public Library had just installed
CyberPatrol. Ironically,
six branches of the Boston library had my
book on the shelves but you couldn't get to
the Web page from a terminal with CyberPatrol installed.

With a new wave of libraries considering the purchase of
blocking software, I decided to go back and take another look
at CyberPatrol. The informal methodology I used was to check
my collection of ethical, political and legal Web sites
(<a href="http://www.spectacle.org/links.html">http://www.spectacle.org/links.html</a>)
against the Cybernot search engine that Microsystems
maintains on its Web page (<a href="http://www.microsys.com">http://www.microsys.com</a>).
A Cybernot search
will tell you whether or not the product blocks a particular
site, but will not reveal in which category it
is blocked. My goal was to determine which of these
sites, containing controversial speech but no obscenity or
illegal material whatever, were blocked by CyberPatrol.

Cybernot reported that CyberPatrol blocked twelve of my
bookmarked sites, out of a total of about 270. These included:

The Flag Burning Page, <a href="http://www.indirect.com/user/warren/flag.html">http://www.indirect.com/user/warren/flag.html</a>.
This site, which I regard as one of the most intelligent and
funny resources on the Web, examines the unconstitutionality
under the First Amendment of laws against burning the flag.

The Second Amendment Foundation, <a href="http://www.saf.org">http://www.saf.org</a>. This
is a large collection of resources on Second Amendment
right-to-bear-arms issues. While the blocking of this
site is questionable under any theory, it is also a nice
illustration of the inconsistency of CyberPatrol and of all
blocking software. The product does not block the
National Rifle Association, <a href="http://www.nra.org">http://www.nra.org</a>, or
numerous other sites on both sides of
the gun control issue.

The Newtwatch page, <a href="http://www.cais.com/newtwatch/">http://www.cais.com/newtwatch/</a>, is
regrettably no longer on the Web, but CyberPatrol blocks it
at its former URL. Funded by the Democratic party,
Newtwatch was a combination of devastating political
reportage and satire aimed at Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich. It contained nothing that was offensive
to children by any stretch of the imagination--
unless they were Republican children with no sense
of humor.

Another vanished Web page that is still blocked is
the Dr. Bonzo web page, <a href="http://www.iglou.com/drbonzo/anathema.htm">http://www.iglou.com/drbonzo/anathema.htm</a>,
a series of satirical essays on religious matters. The blocking
of these two pages, long removed from the Web, raises
questions about the frequency with which the CyberPatrol
database is updated. A third blocked page which is no
longer on the Web contained nothing but a copy of
the U.S. Constitution.

Other sites contained some explicit text but did so in
the pursuit of a socially significant goal. For example,
the Jake Baker page,
<a href="http://krusty.eecs.umich.edu/people/pjswan/Baker/Jake_Baker.html">http://krusty.eecs.umich.edu/people/pjswan/Baker/Jake_Baker.html</a>,
contains news reports and analysis of the case of the
University of Michigan student who was arrested for
distributing a rape and torture fantasy about a classmate
on Usenet. Baker's stories, which led to his arrest,
are also linked from this page.
The case broke some new legal ground, and Mark Mangan
and I used this site as a research resource in writing
Sex, Laws and Cyberspace. It is hard to imagine how we
could have written about the case without reading
Baker's horrifying stories, which are presumably
the reason why CyberPatrol blocks the entire site.

 CyberPatrol also blocks a Usenet search engine,
www.dejanews.com. Dejanews, of course, is a
major resource for anyone searching for Usenet discussion on
any topic, and we also relied heavily on it in writing
Sex, Laws and Cyberspace. One startled user of the Austin
Public Library posted  to Usenet a
few weeks ago: &quot;As DejaNews is one of the top Internet
research tools, [this] decision transcends comprehension.&quot;
Dejanews does not relay any graphics posted to Usenet;
Microsystems apparently fears users will find explicit
text.

CyberPatrol blocked some of the bookmarked sites for
no imaginable reason. The company has admitted
to a number of errors in the past, in addition
to the blocking of the Sex, Laws and Cyberspace
page. Like other blocking software companies,
Microsystems has employees surfing the
Web, looking for sites to add to the Cybernot list--
and frequently they are not very careful. For
example, Cybernot reports that the Society
for the Promotion of Unconditional Relationships (SPUR)
( <a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/estate/xgv92/spur2.htm">http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/estate/xgv92/spur2.htm</a>)
is blocked. The group describes its mission
thus: &quot;to increase
public understanding and awareness of the nature and
benefits of Unconditional Commitment in
Relationships.&quot; The SPUR page contains articles
with names like &quot;The Role of Faith in Relationships.&quot;

It was also hard to understand why CyberPatrol blocks the
Interactivism page (www.interactivism.com). This site specializes
in virtual activism; its top page, as I write these words,
invites you to send faxes to politicians on issues including
 handgun control,  freedom for Tibet,  and campaign
finance reform.

Adults researching a variety of topics, notably
freedom of speech-related issues, in the Austin public
library are going to run into some significant roadblocks.
The Austin library blocks four categories, three of them
sex-related (including the categories under which
Dejanews and the Jake Baker page are blocked) and
the fourth entitled &quot;gross depictions&quot;. Jon Lebkowsky,
an Austin-based author and activist, was involved in discussions
with library officials about their installation
of CyberPatrol. He commented: &quot;The Austin Public
Library promised that filters would be an 'interim
measure,' but backed off from that promise,
thinking that their scaled-down
filtering was gaining acceptance....
The APL should have honored the American Library
Association's position on filters and removed the
software after the Supreme Court's CDA decision.&quot;

 Microsystems  acknowledges  that
CyberPatrol was never meant to be used to determine what
adults can see. In March 1997, Susan Getgood
wrote in a message posted to the Fight-Censorship
list:

&quot;The CyberNOT list was designed to be used by adults
to manage children's access to the Internet.
It is not a filter meant for adults.&quot;

A few weeks ago, at the annual New York Library
Association meeting in Syracuse, Susan Getgood
conducted a panel on blocking software. During the
Q&amp;A afterwards, I asked her:

&quot;Isn't it true that CyberPatrol blocks First Amendment
protected, socially valuable material?&quot;

Susan thought for an extraordinarily long time before
answering the question. Finally, she said very carefully,
that in creating the Cybernot list, Microsystems didn't
think about whether blocked pages are constitutionally
protected or socially valuable. The company only thought
about whether the material is (by its own standards)
&quot;inappropriate for children.&quot;

Microsystems standards for determining appropriateness
were not written by a librarian, nor meant for use in libraries.
They weren't meant to keep speech from adult eyes.
Applied to children, they draw no distinction between
eight year olds and eighteen year olds.
The latter conceivably might have a research assignment
which involves looking at the Flag Burning page, the
Jake Baker page or the Second Amendment Foundation.
&quot;Just as the CDA tried to reduce the entire net to
something appropriate for 12-year-olds,
so CyberPatrol is trying to expand the
children's section to fill the entire library&quot;, said
Jamie McCarthy, an Internet activist and software
developer based in Michigan.

In the Boston Public Library, CyberPatrol is installed
on terminals used by people under 18, unless there is
a parental permission slip on file allowing use of an
uncensored computer. The three sex-related categories
aree blocked; one of these, SexActs, is used to block
text-only sites and is one of the categories assigned
to Dejanews and the Jake Baker page. This category
has also been used to block feminist discussion groups.

The company's willingness to unblock sites is meaningless.
The Internet is growing by leaps and bounds every week,
and even as the company deletes sites like mine from the Cybernot
database, Microsystems' harried surfers will be making
fresh mistakes. Seth Finkelstein,
a Boston-based software developer who follows censorware
issues closely, commented: &quot;No small group of
people can hope to keep up with all the
changes on the Web. Offering to correct 'mistakes',
while good from a marketing standpoint, simply
does not make up for the impossible
nature of the task. We only see the problems
which have been exposed so far; what else is lurking,
 not yet uncovered in their blacklist?&quot;

Putting a barrier between users and research sources
is not what libraries do. Mark Mangan and
I could not have written Sex, Laws and Cyberspace in
the Austin library; too many of our sources are blocked.
(Cyberpatrol also previously blocked The Electronic
Frontier Foundation archives, www.eff.org, and the MIT Student
Association for Free Expression, www.mit.edu/activities/safe/,
two other sources we consulted in writing our book.)
I hope that there are at least some librarians in Austin
who feel ashamed that their library could not be used as
a research source for a book on freedom of speech.

CyberPatrol doesn't belong in public libraries. The company,
by its own statements, has all but admitted this. The library
which buys CyberPatrol has only itself to blame for its dereliction
of responsibility towards its users.

commerce: something indeterminate that's always booming on the
Internet, although no one you know has ever seen or benefited from it.

Usage: Representatives of a grotesquely hyped Internet start-up asserted
that its commerce was tripling monthly in cyberspace even as
the firm surreptitiously filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11.


expert: instrument of journalists deployed to burnish
whatever received wisdom is being passed on as news; or, instrument
of journalists used to furnish stock criticisms for
heretical or unpopular findings; or, someone frequently counted on by
hack journalists to provide Delphic wisdom on a subject or subjects
the expert knows little about.

Usage: The think tank expert was often asked for
her comments on computer viruses and information warfare even though it
had been shown she was computer illiterate.


hardware glitch: The cause of all human errors and oversights
leading to down time and lost e-mail at national Internet Service
Providers or Online Services.

Usage: America On-Line mouthpiece Tatiana Gau
insisted a hardware glitch was responsible for the system-wide
failure.


Road Ahead, The: a book for those who despise books,
credited to a man who also despises books.

Usage: Unable to unload the excessive printing of
&quot;The Road Ahead&quot; in the continental United States, Bill Gates
came up with the novel idea of arm-twisting Russian paupers wishful
for his beneficence into purchasing copies for about 9 dollars,

Dear Mr. Klein:

I am writing to ask the Department of Justice (DOJ) to protect consumers
by taking action to prevent Microsoft from using anticompetitive
practices to  monopolize the market for Internet browsers. Specifically,
Microsoft should not be permitted to force third party developers to
redistribute Microsoft Internet Explorer in order to use features found
in a programming API (Application Program Interface).

A specific API shipped originally with the Microsoft Windows 95 OS
(Operating System) and was just recently enhanced with new features that
make it attractive for third party developers to use. This API is known
to developers as the Common Control DLL. Because this is an enhancement
to the OS that came after the initial release of Microsoft Windows 95,
it is necessary for third party developers to distribute the updated OS
components with their software in order to ensure that their software
works properly. However, Microsoft is not allowing developers to
redistribute only the components that they need, instead Microsoft is
demanding that Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 is distributed with the
third party software

It is the responsibility of DOJ to ensure that Microsoft does not use
its OS monopoly to monopolize the market for applications. I believe
that forcing third party developers to distribute Microsoft Internet
Explorer is a blatant anti-competitive act.

Sincerely,
Brian Glaeske

1995 charges is scheduled for April 14, 1998.

Even though the trial has not yet started, Kevin has exhausted his
funds for legal representation. His court appointed attorney had
been denied payment for 4 months by Judge Mariana Pfaelzer for
what she considers exessive bills for computer experts. &quot;I've
rarely ever seen bills that high. I'm absolutely stunned at what
those bills look like,&quot; she said.  &quot;If you think you're going to
have an unlimited budget, you're wrong.&quot;
