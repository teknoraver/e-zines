Subject: File 1--Intro to CuD Special Issue on Net Education

Computer-enhanced processes of education and learning promise &quot;new
and improved&quot; forms of delivering knowledge to students, and
technology is often seen as a possible supplement for, even
alternative means of, teaching. The question becomes whether this
technology will ultimately enhance education or whether it poses
more dangers than it is worth.  Technology undoubtedly can produce
new ways of formulating knowledge and also new locate, retrieve,
and process information.  But, can the promise of a
computer-generated pedagogical revolution be realized? Or, are the
promises just another brand of &quot;snake oil&quot; in which the dangers
outweigh any realistic curative power?

The emergence of online universities range from fly-by-night
operations to sophisticated consortiums, including the ten-state
Western University, and many states are exploring
computer-mediated educational projects as alternatives to
classrooms. In Illinois, for example, a task force of the Illinois
Board of Higher Education has formed a task force whose mandate
includes examination of delivering interactive technology-based
distance learning beyond the conventional classroom setting.

A month ago, we indicated that we would run a few special issues
on the Net and education-related issues. We have a variety of
bits, blurbs, commentaries and general info that we'll run over
the next month or two. We will try to include everything from
short announcements to conferences and full-length articles from
as many perspectives as possible.

Some of the issues in this &quot;Education and the Net&quot; series might
strike some as out of the general range of normal CuD topics.
But, the emergence of the Net as a teaching aid, and the growing
of some states to pursue distance learning in &quot;virtual classrooms&quot;
makes this a critically important issue.

Is a virtual classroom possible?  Can learning occur without
face-to-face contact? Is there a difference between &quot;Net learning&quot;
and &quot;Net education?&quot; Can the Net replace conventional classrooms?
Will virtual classrooms be driven by fiscal concerns and, in a
sort of Gresham's law, drive out the more expensive face-to-face
pedagogy? Does synchronous audio-visual/interactive software
provide the same benefits as face-to-face learning?  These and
other questions will be addressed each month for the next few
months.

We hope that those with experience in or opinions about &quot;virtual
education&quot; will periodically respond to some of the issues raised.

Subject: File 2--A Celebration of the Potential of the Net

Since it's dawn in 1992, the famed Internet has always been used
for one purpose and one purpose only:  information.  The Net has
always been seen as a highway laid with silicon.  Netizens are
road warriors.  Their will based on the faith that there will
always be something to learn; their vehicles, powered by
electricity, called computers.  They drive on the Information
SuperHighway and on backroads, called &quot;networks&quot;.  Some have
roamed these roads forever, and their skills have sharpened by
this.  Some have come to be wizards in the enlightened realm of
darkness called Cyberspace, the uncharted territory between man
and machine.  The world will never be the same as it was when the
invention of the Internet was constructed.  In the course of but
a few years, the world communicated through and with the greatest
construction man has made since the telephone.  The Net was made
known, and mankind smiled at the possibilities.  And they had
every right to...

With this issue, we celebrate the Internet, and the possibilities
it holds, and has achieved.  We celebrate a future, a
relationship, and a connection, with our mechanical
counter-parts, our greatest non-living friends, the machines.

The Vacuity of Information
   --------------------------

According to David Shenk, author of *Data Smog: Surviving the
Information Glut*,

   For many businesses, the irony is that the cheaper information
   becomes, the more expensive it is to deal with.

Yes, although I'm not so sure about the irony.  If &quot;information&quot;
is precisely articulable, if it is measurable as so many bits
stored in a database, if it is easily transmissible -- in other
words, if it fits the criteria for information according to the
prevalent rhetoric -- then it follows in a straightforward way
that any preoccupation with information will penalize our pursuit
of whatever is important.

Why?  Because the precision, the measurability, and the
transmissibility all stand in a kind of opposition to depth of
meaning and significance.  This trade-off is clearly demonstrable
through an examination of the basic act of communication (see, for
example, my discussion in
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/people/staff/stevet/fdnc/ch23.html">http://www.oreilly.com/people/staff/stevet/fdnc/ch23.html</a>), yet it
remains the great, ignored truth at the heart of the Information
Age.  We have, of course, almost made a cliche of the slogan,
&quot;information is not wisdom.&quot; But until we vividly recognize the
actual *opposition* between the two terms -- and learn to live
creatively within this opposition -- the effort to reconceive
society in terms of information and its flows will prove extremely
corrosive of everything that matters.

===============================================================
             EDITORIAL:  Alternative News Revolution
===============================================================
A specter is haunting cyber-space.  The specter of alternative
news.

I suppose that I wouldn't be informing anyone of anything{2} if
I announced that there is a lot of good information available in
cyberspace.  Vice President Gore pronounced as much several
years ago.  Which pretty much makes the concept official.
There's even real news in cyberspace.  But the real spine
jolting, heart stopping, mind numbingly incredible fact of the
matter is that the traditional method of delivery of news as we
know it--at least in the USA--may not be the best, most
effective or ACCURATE way to gather one's news!{3}  This
observation, if you buy it, is doubly shocking in the USA where
the news media shares a role in our society on par with the
importance of the three &quot;official&quot; Constitutional branches of
government.{4}

Alternative news sources have been around as long as humans have
existed.  In a primitive form, sitting on the front porch and
gossiping with the neighbors is &quot;alternative news.&quot;  Or standing
around the water cooler at work.  But to get one's story told in
the mainstream news is another matter.  By &quot;mainstream&quot; news, I
mean TV, radio, newspapers and magazines with glossy pages.
That is, the way that we have obtained most of our news for the
the second half of the 20th Century.  In order for a story to be
published in the mainstream news, the story has to be something
that the mainstream media wants to publish.  And what the
mainstream media wants to publish is the best story with which
to  package the advertising.  So the &quot;traditional&quot; or
&quot;mainstream&quot; media is also the &quot;commercial&quot; media.  Certainly,
big, expensive, high-tech news organizations have to be
profitable if they are going to be free of government financing
(read:  &quot;government control&quot;).  But the mainstream media--what
we used to call the &quot;free press&quot;--is not quite free.  It is
mostly free from government control, but still quite dependant
on commercial market forces.  That is, advertising.  What pushes
sales in advertising?  That which is sexual, lurid, unusual,
outlandish, trendy.  Especially sexual.  What shows up in the
commercial news?  Same thing.  But none of this is to say that
commercial news is evil, or unreliable.  Given a choice between
the government, or the soft drink, beer, and automotive
companies steering the direction of the news, I'll pick the
latter every time.  Certainly, incrementally, the mainstream
commercial news is pretty accurate.  Yes, there was really a
murder downtown last night.  And, yes, there really were three
unrelated murders in different neighborhoods last week.  And, in
fact, some people did get knocked off around town every week for
as long as I remember.  Welcome to the big city in the US of A.
Each cops and killer news story is accurate (to some extent)
when taken alone.  But the commercial news is not really
accurate when taken in the aggregate.  To focus on the lurid and
unsavory is to distort what the &quot;news&quot; is really about.  IMHO,
of course.  So if a former football player kills his wife{5},
the commercial news can't be pried off the story with an
oversized crowbar.  Or if a well known fashion designer gets
killed--another uproar.  And all of the time and effort expended
on such news--that is, the unseemly packaging for beer and soft
drink commercials--crowds out what might have been called news
in a former time.

Commercial news is probably what the public wants to hear.  If
it wasn't, then the marketing whiz bangs would steer the news to
what the consumers (eh, that's &quot;audience&quot;) wants to hear.  I
could argue that the public needs REAL news--not the blood and
guts parade of horrors that passes as the evening news.  But
it's a funny fact that apparently the public does NOT need any
such thing.  The world seems to function just fine with the
majority of its' population blithely just along for the ride.
In fact, I find no fault with the commercial news doing what it
is intended to do.  Sell a product.  Having said all of this, in
all fairness to commercial news, if you look in the right place
at the right time, you may stumble across a piece or two of real
news in the mainstream commercial news.  An unavoidable
by-product of the commercial packaging, I suppose.

Advances in modern electronic communication--particularly the
popularization of communications via personal computers--have
added a totally new dimension to the distribution of news.  It
is a a dimension that is largely overlooked and wildly
under-reported by (you guessed it) the mainstream commercial
media!

Internet Newsgroups, FidoNet Echo's{6} and computer mailing
lists  are particularly valuable sources of alternative news.
Without getting bogged down in a discussion of the how the
technology works,{7} suffice it to say that these formats permit
the news &quot;source&quot; to log onto a host computer, such as an
Internet service provider or a BBS and post messages/text
files.  The message can be most anything, including front line,
on the edge, cutting news.  Any other computer user, anywhere
else in the world can log on to another computer and read the
message.  So far, we have the recipe for a mad, chaotic cyber
shouting match.  But, notwithstanding the needle in the haystack
image, a lot of good, alternative news gets transmitted this
way.  The problem is sorting out the valuable news from the
crackpots and porno advertisers.  Some perfectly respectable
sounding distribution channels--Newsgroups, Usenet or
FidoNet--seem to have have nothing but advertisements for
Internet sites where you can find pictures of nude
cheerleaders.{8}  However, if there's a moderator, and a way to
enforce the banishment of kooks and creeps, then you may still
be able to sift through the junk for some good stuff.  Of
course, depending on the moderator, you may have a sage guide to
the far corners of alternative cyber news.  Or you might just
inject another kook or crackpot into the mix.

Now the astute reader{9} will ask how I can say that commercial
news is inaccurate because in the aggregate it distorts the
importance of things; and still suggest that alternative news is
any better when in the aggregate, it is vastly more untamed and
difficult to gather in a usable form.  So it is here that I must
admit that it is only in certain areas that alternative news
really excels.  You have to know which mailing lists to
subscribe to; and which Internet newsgroups; and which FidoNet
echoes to visit.  And you have to accept that only certain types
of news are really well reported.  Large, national or global
matters are well reported in alternative news channels.{10}
Telecommunication, social and political issues are extremely
well reported.  As well as thousands of other topics from the
esoteric to the downright inane.  For the most part, alternative
news on these topics can be found which is just as accurate{11},
more timely, and more detailed than what you will find in
traditional commercial news channels.  And once you locate the
appropriate alternate news channels, you can forevermore have
the news delivered right to your very own e-mailbox.

Good quality mailing lists are easy to find and subscriptions
are usually free.  If there is a mailing list that charges a
fee, I'd be suspicious.  Mailing lists may be a steady stream of
information--like a traditional wire service--or a periodically
published newsletter or eMagazine.  Internet Newsgroup
discussion areas are offered, at least in the USA, as part of
the basic package from most any Internet Service provider
(ISP).  And for the frugal folks among our readers, FidoNet is
free, if you have a local subscribing BBS.

You might guess from the title of this publication--oNline
Christian eMagazine--that the alternative news sources that I
personally subscribe to tend to be pretty conservative.  But
regardless of your religious persuasion, political point of
view, nationality or orientation, some news sources that you
might think are too preachy are in fact pretty good sources of
alternative news.  Missionary groups have been known to travel
the world in search of troubled spots, political uprisings,
social turmoil, famines, natural disasters and the like.  A lot
of these folks are part time reporters and like to send e-mail
by the bushel.  Another source of alternative news by the ton
are the academic-type egg heads.  They love to send out
newsletters, when they're not too busy torturing
undergraduates.  Also, a newsletter is easier than getting
published in a real academic journal.  I could give you a list
of my favorite alternative news sources.  But that would take
the sport of the whole endeavor for you.  Just look around.

To paraphrase that fellow, Karl somebody:  Cyber citizens of all
nations Unite!  You have nothing to lose but silly commercials
and lurid mainstream pseudo-news.  You have a world to gain.

     MicroMUSE / MuseNet Receives 1996 NII Award

MicroMUSE / MuseNet (Multi-User Science Education Network) has
won recognition from the National Information Insfrastructure (NII).

The judges for the prestigious NII Awards have singled out
MicroMUSE / MuseNet for a Certificate of Merit in the 1996
competition, for path-breaking innovation in children's education on
the Internet. &quot;The Certificate of Merit is awarded to projects that
have distinguished themselves in a particular area, or have accomplished
something extraordinary overall,&quot; said Jeannine Parker, Director of the
Awards Competition.

&quot;MicroMUSE / MuseNet has been recognized by our Judges as an
exceptional project,&quot; Parker said. &quot;In awarding the Certificate of
Merit, they made the following comment about your entry: An
extraordinary example of corporations partnering with schools and
providing value to both parties.&quot;

The Citation reads: &quot;The NII Awards recognize extraordinary
achievement in a new era of communication and knowledge and offer
a compelling vision of what is possible when human creativity

Subject: File 6--New Free Educational Sites

Just a brief note to let you know about two new educational sites
 that are interactive and intended for non-technical audiences. I
 thought you might be interested in these new programs. Human
 Anatomy On-line covers the subject of the anatomy and Automotive
 Learning On-line covers the subject of automobiles.  They include
 hundreds of graphics, educational information and animations.
 These two programs are free to the Internet community. This is a
 great resource that delivers educational material for
 schoolchildren to adults. I hope that you will find them to be of
 high quality and educational.

Thank you for your time.

*** Multiculturalism without People (113 lines)

From Lowell Monke &lt;<a href="/cgi-bin/cframes/compose?disk=207.82.250.104_d50&login=s_costa&f=33793&curmbox=ACTIVE&mailto=1&to=lm7846s@acad.drake.edu&msg=MSG874656529.0&start=428771&len=33590&src=&type=x" target="_top">lm7846s@acad.drake.edu</a>&gt;

     Letter from Des Moines
     June 15, 1997

There is a flip side to the use of the 'Net for multicultural education,
which I discussed in NF #49.  It has to do with the the way the 'Net
affects students' and teachers' attitudes toward other cultures that exist
in their own communities.

For a variety of reasons, Des Moines has become a popular destination for
refugees and immigrants from all over the world.  The ESL (English as a
Second Language) program has exploded in the district, and Central Campus
is the first stop for most high schoolers trying to learn English.
(Central Campus isn't a school in itself; we provide special services to
all of the five district high schools.)  Even though our program is a
revolving door moving students to their high schools full-time as quickly
as possible, there are constantly around 200 ESL students attending
Central Campus.

One day a couple of years ago, I happened to be standing outside my room
just down the hall from the doors opening into a Gifted and Talented
Language Arts room and an adjacent ESL room, when the bell rang to end
classes.  I watched the two groups of students emerge from their rooms,
walk side-by-side the twenty feet out the narrow corridor which spills
into the hallway, turn the same direction and walk to their lockers, which
were directly opposite each other in the hall.  From the time the doors
opened to the time the halls were cleared, I never saw anyone from one
class talk to a person in the other class.  Indeed, to the Language Arts
students the ESL students seemed more like obstacles to navigate around
than interesting people to engage.

I don't blame the students for this, and I don't want to paint them as
callous snobs.  They were merely doing what all students do in a large
school:  associating with their friends, letting the mass of humanity flow
by.  But what really caught my attention was that among the students
emerging from the Language Arts class were most of the students from a
global telecommunications project I was running at the time -- one that
centered around a multicultural theme.  Here we had been exchanging ideas
about cultures with students on the other side of the planet for months,
and it had never dawned on these students to merely turn their heads 90
degrees and talk to students from Bosnia, Somalia, the Sudan, Russia,
Mexico, the Czech Republic, and half a dozen other nations.  The
disassociation unnerved me.  What does it mean when a group of students
are eager (these were all volunteers) to relate to students all over the
world via the 'Net, but show no interest at all in talking face-to-face
with young people who grew up in some of those very same places?

As I said, the students have some excuse.  It's difficult in the best of
circumstances for young people to initiate new relationships.  With ESL
students, language is an additional hurdle.  But that's where the
teacher's responsibility comes in.  Far more important than the students'
oversight was my negligence.  So the question can be reframed to ask what
does it mean when teachers like myself don't even think about bringing
these two groups of students together, but instead look to the 'Net to
fling disembodied text all around the world at people whom our students
will likely never meet, and then claim that we have increased our
students' multicultural &quot;awareness&quot;?

I don't know whether it should make me feel better that I found only one
teacher (who teaches world history) who has invited these new immigrants
to talk with his students.  In my own son's third grade class there are
two Bosnian students, two students whose parents came from Southeast Asia,
and one whose parents came from India.  None of those students, nor their
parents, ever got to share with the class their knowledge of their
homelands, their customs, their reasons for coming here.  Yet we are, as I
have said, spending millions of dollars to get computers into the
elementary classrooms right now, in part so that our sons and daughters
can get involved with the neat multicultural activities on the Internet.

A minister once told me about the Missionary Syndrome.  This is when
members of a congregation are willing to empty their pockets to aid the
unknown hapless people who live at least 1000 miles away, but won't lift a
finger to help the down-and-outs in their own community (who they know all
too well).  There seems to be something of the Missionary Syndrome in our
passion to connect our students with people on the other side of the
world. For some reason we are willing to settle for, even get excited
about, bits of writing from long distance, while turning our backs on the
stories and insights of students who are literally within arm's reach.

It's hard to believe it is the human dimensions of communication that
drive this kind of activity.  I think for most of us it is our infatuation
with the exotic opportunities afforded by the technology, its awesome
ability to compress space and time, that drives multicultural (and most
other educational) activities on the 'Net.

But we ought to recognize that it is also the school structure that
contributes to this easy willingness to seek out abstract relationships
rather than in-the-flesh ones.  We teachers suffer from the same
reluctance as our students:  working with other teachers is often
frustrating.  After all, we have been trained to be loners or, at best,
collaborators within our departments. The curriculum pigeon-holes all of
us so that cutting across it takes enormous energy and creativity -- and
not a little willingness to battle bureaucrats.  We have all gotten used
to relying on standardized texts and all the inert material resources that
come with them.  People just aren't convenient enough, reliable enough,
controllable enough, or full of the objective information we have come to
treasure.  Add to this mix a machine that you can turn on and off at will
and it's pretty easy for the teacher to turn a blind eye on the
educational opportunities that exist right outside the classroom door.

All of the conditions I've just mentioned are regularly used as arguments
for getting students on the 'Net. It allows for collaboration; cuts across
the curriculum; and can be customized to suit the teacher and student.
But as the little vignettes I've just related illustrate, the comfortable
escape the 'Net provides from a regimented system may very well defeat the
very purpose we try to use it for.  The 'Net provides the form, but lacks
the rich content -- the real human, flesh-and-blood relational content,
with all the messy issues that we and our students are forced to deal with
-- which is the true essence of multicultural education.  Or of any
education at all, for that matter.
