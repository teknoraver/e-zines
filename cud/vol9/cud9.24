Subject: File 1--Coup-d-etat on the Internet around Usenet hierarchy <gov.*>?

On Sun, 16 Mar 1997 23:54:39 GMT, tale@isc.org (David C Lawrence)
<858556478.926@isc.org> wrote announcing the creation of a new
meta-hierarchial group under the <gov.*> hierarchy.:

I, like many others, have not followed every discussion on <news.groups> as
closely as I could have.

But I do not recall reading or seeing any Request For Discussion document
filed in <new.groups> or <news.groups.announce> for the creation of such
changes. Nor do I recall seeing any Call For Votes document for such a
massive change in the hierarchy.

I certainly could have missed such RFDs and CFVs.

But, assuming that I did not miss them because neither was ever issued, am
I the only one to see in the sudden creation of <gov.*> a slippery slope of
globally massive dimensions whereby the U.S. and inferentially other
governments just launched a info-war coup-d-etat on UseNet in particular
and the Internet in general?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The GovNews hierarchy, gov.*, is a new framework for exchange of
public information at all levels of government around the world via
the Internet.  It is a tool to improve communication to the government,
from the government, and between various governmental bodies by
providing both announcement channels and topical discussion groups.

Users can currently access the hierarchy via the NNTP server at
news.govnews.org.  Many major sites, including AOL, AT&T, BBN Planet,
CompuServe, MCI, Sprint and UUNET, are also already carrying and
feeding the initial set of gov.* newsgroups, and it is listed in
<URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active>.

The GovNews Project workers ask news administrators to please carry
this new hierarchy at their own sites as their resources allow.  The
volume of the hierarchy is expected to be roughly that of comp.* or
rec.* --- far less than that of alt.binaries.*, since the majority of
traffic will be non-binary messages.

This message contains all the information news administrators need to
create the hierarchy at their own sites.  Below is the PGP information
(see <URL:ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/README.html>) for gov.*
control messages.  Following it is a list of the initial set of
newsgroups for gov.*, with their descriptions.  It is suitable for
input to INN's "docheckgroups" or C News's "checkgroups" scripts, or
can be suitably massaged on other systems to generate the list of
groups to add.  Please note that many are moderated.

Additional information about the GovNews Project can be found at
<URL:http://www.govnews.org/govnews/>.

Thank you for your interest.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
1)		BUFFER OVERFLOW BUG DISCOVERED IN RLOGIN

Yet another program has fallen victim to the buffer overflow
vulnerability family. This vulnerability allows a user with
access to an account on the host to potentially overrun a buffer
and possibly execute programs as root on the local machine.  Patches
are available from some vendors and CERT has provided a wrapper
program as a workaround. For more information, see

    <ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert-advisories/CA-97.06.rlogin-term>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
2)            A LAYMAN's EXPLANATION OF BUFFER OVERFLOW

Stack and buffer overflows? Still wondering what it all means?
Security vulnerabilities resulting from buffer overflow problems
are very common today. To see how common, see Aleph One's "Smashing
the Stack for Fun and Profit." It's a layman's explanation of the
inner workings of buffer overflow problems. The article is located at:

        <http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1996_4/0195.html>

Recent victim program of the buffer overflow problem include:
sendmail, gethostbyname, syslog, Linux/FreeBSD mount, and rlogin.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
3)                 YASB -  YET ANOTHER SENDMAIL BUG

A new vulnerability concerning a buffer overflow in the MIME
section of code has been discovered in Sendmail versions 8.8.3
and 8.8.4. This vulnerability allows an external attacker to
possibly gain access to a local host. Version 8.8.5, corrects
this bug and several others found in earlier versions.  It's
available at:

    <ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.8.5.tar.gz>

Vendor patches for their versions of sendmail are available from
many of the vendors. Refer to the CERT advisory located at:

    <ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-97.05.sendmail>

Those of you who are unable to upgrade to the latest version
or cannot install the vendor patch right away, will find a useful
a workaround described in that CERT Advisory.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
4)		SERIOUS BUG IN WU-FTPD V2.4

A new, potentially serious flaw was discovered in the wu-ftpd code.
The flaw is present in version 2.4 as well as in the version
available form Academ.  The problem has been corrected in the
Academ version 2.4.2-beta-12. The vulnerability may allow regular
and anonymous users to access files on your ftp server as root.
The problem lies in the signal handling section of the code. An
advisory sent out by AUSCERT on 1/29/97 advises that this particular
bug may also be present in some vendor versions as well. For more
information, refer to the AUSCERT advisory at:

	<ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/advisory/\
	 AA-97.03.ftpd.signal.handling.vul>

5)          TWO NEW NT SECURITY MAILING LISTS GO ONLINE

Has your beloved desktop UNIX box been replaced with an NT? Are
you concerned about what security problems may be lurking on this
new platform? Two new NT security discussions mail lists may help
you find all the answers you seek.  The first, NTbugtraq was created
in the spirit of bugtraq mailing list. To subscribe, send a message
to Listserv@rc.on.ca with "SUB NTBUGTRAQ Your Name" in the text. The
second, hosted by ISS, is called ntsecurity. To subscribe send email to
request-ntsecurity@iss.net and in the text put "subscribe ntsecurity".
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
6)           VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED IN NT RPC CODE

While we are discussing NT, does your new Pentium Pro 200MHZ
processor running NT seem v e r y  s l o w . . . ?   Perhaps the
RPC services running on your workstation have been confused and
are consuming all the CPU resources. Recent postings to the NT
security mailing lists discuss how RPC services running on
NT (3.51 and 4.0) can be confused by a simple telnet to TCP port
135 and typing more than 15 characters. Microsoft has a patch for
the problem.  Refer to:

	<ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/\
	 fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP2/RPC-fix>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
7)     COPS V1.04 STILL MOST POPULAR HOST-BASED AUDITING TOOL

COPS is a UNIX security toolkit that analyzes your system security.
COPS version 1.04 still leads the charge for testing system
integrity and vulnerability level.  Despite being several years
old, COPS continues to be an excellent public domain product for
examining group and password files, root environment and system
setup, user home directories, important system configuration files,
ftp setup and several miscellaneous problems.  If you are already
using COPS, then you are well aware of the benefits provided.

If you are not yet using COPS, it makes sense to at least try it
out. You can find it at:

	<ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/tools/cops>

COPS is one of many tools described in Matt Bishop's latest course
on security tools which he will present at SANS97 in April.
See <http://www.sans.org/> for  more information.

8)               MACRO VIRUS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO GROW

The remorseless rise of the macro virus continues. The latest
Macro Virus List published by the Virus Test Centre at the
University of Hamburg lists 205 viruses, most of which are Word
viruses  The list also includes ten Trojan Horses (malicious
programs which don't replicate) and five macro virus generators
(programs which allow the wannabe virus coder to 'create' viruses
without the hassle of actual programming).

The list is located at:

  <ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/pub/virus/macro/macrolst.96c>

The December WildList reports more than twenty macro viruses as
being in the wild. Another twenty or so made the Supplemental
List. The WildList gives some idea of which viruses are actually
in the wild by tracking virus incidents reported by at least two
of the of the 45 virus information professionals who participate in
the list. The Supplemental List includes viruses which only one of
these professionals has reported. The most common reports are of
WM.Concept.A (the original 'prank macro'), WM.Wazzu.A, and the
comparatively recent NPad (Jakarta).

The Wildlist also provides a listing of the most frequently reported
viruses (those reported by at least one-third of the 45 participants).

You can find the December Wildlist at two locations:

        <ftp://ftp.ncsa.com/pub/virus/wildlist/>
        <http://www.virusbtn.com/WildLists/>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
9)    Microsoft's Macro Virus Protection Tool (MVTOOL): AV or PR?

Microsoft's ScanProt protection tool (a collection of WordBasic
macros) is frequently recommended as a prophylactic against macro
viruses. However, MVTOOLS's capabilities should not
be overestimated.  The primary purpose of the tool is to alert
users to the existence of macros in their documents.

 - It actually recognizes only the original Concept virus
     (WM.Concept.A). It can clean Concept, but is liable to
     crash if it encounters too many infected files.

 - Though other viruses are mentioned in the README.DOC
     which accompanies the protection tool, the others are
     not specifically recognized now and may never be.

It's best to supplement MVTOOL by purchasing one of the many
anti-virus utilities such as F-Prot Professional or VirusScan.

10)               THE NEVER-ENDING HOAX VIRUSES

Hoax alerts are becoming an increasing drain on corporate
resources.  As more companies implement effective virus-control
strategies, most viruses being detected at the point of entry.
Security professionals increasingly find themselves spending
more time on hoaxes, jokes and erroneous alerts than on 'real'
virus incidents.

Many hoax alerts are variations on the infamous 'Good Times'
virus - for instance Deeyenda, PenPal Greetings, and Irina are
all fairly easily identified, even by the technically challenged,
by symptoms such as a surfeit of capital letters and exclamation
marks, citing of unlikely authorities such as the FCC, and
urgings to forward the alert to as many people as possible.

While it is easy enough to circulate details of known hoaxes, it
gets harder to tell non-experts how to recognize a new hoax as
they become more numerous and ingenious.

Two suggestions:

(1) Refer all alerts to a security professional with the contacts
and experience to verify them, or the will to acquire the experience.

(2) Make it a matter of policy that users don't forward alerts
without having them verified.

Newbie hoax-watchers are advised to keep an eye on the following
web sites:
           http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html
           http://www.kumite.com/myths/

11)      RECOMMENDATIONS PLEASE: MOST USEFUL COMMERCIAL TOOLS?

We've persuaded the leading vendors in several categories to show
their newest offerings at SANS (O'Reilly for books; Axent for
access control; Syntax for network integration of UNIX, Netware,
NT and Mac; ESM for name space management for intranets; Auspex
and Falcon for very fast NFS Servers; and PDC for backup, plus a
bunch more.) Nine spots are left, and we want to reserve them for
organizations that are leaders in other useful categories or for
innovative small companies on the East Coast.  If you have an
opinion about candidates in either category, please email
alanpaller@aol.com, with your suggestion and an explanation of
why their product is important enough to be in the SANS97 exhibits.
