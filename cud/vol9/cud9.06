56-kbps modem? Not quite
By Jim Davis
January 2, 1997, 5:30 p.m. PT

U.S. Robotics (USRX), which has been leading the push for 56-kbps
modem technology, has conducted preliminary tests showing that
most consumers will be able to connect at higher speeds than with
current modems--but not at the full 56 kbps.

The company said the maximum downstream transmission speed will
be limited to 53 kbps, not the 56 kbps originally promised.
Federal Communications Commission regulations "limit the signal
level" that digitally connected server equipment can transmit,
the firm said.

U.S. Robotics' x2 technology overcomes the speed limits of
current 28.8-kbps modems based on the ISP having a direct
connection to telephone companies' digital switches.

The company said today that tests showed that "the vast majority"
of users would be able to use x2 technology, while its modems
would automatically default to lower speeds if such connections
weren't possible. The test results were based on over 20,000
calls in seven Bell operating company regions, the firm said.

U.S. Robotics says it is in beta testing of its products and
expects to start shipping initial consumer products later this
month.

                 THE INTERNET SOCIETY 1997 SYMPOSIUM ON
                 NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM SECURITY
                              (NDSS '97)

                          10-11 FEBRUARY 1997

            SAN DIEGO PRINCESS RESORT, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA


  This fourth annual symposium will bring together researchers,
  implementors, and users of network and distributed system security
  technologies to discuss today's important security issues and
  challenges.  It will provide a mix of technical papers and panel
  presentations that describe promising new approaches to security
  problems that are practical, and to the extent possible, have
  been implemented.  We hope to foster the exchange of technical
  information and encourage the Internet community to deploy
  available security technologies and develop new solutions to
  unsolved problems.

WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND

  The use of the Internet is rapidly growing and expanding into
  all aspects of our society.  Commercial organizations are coming
  under increasing pressure to make their services available on-line.
  This in turn is increasing the need for rapid and widespread
  deployment of usable and effective network and distributed system
  security technologies.  High visibility attacks on the Internet
  underscore the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the need to
  solve its security problems.  There is growing concern for securing
  the network infrastructure itself.  Recent trends in software
  distribution (such as Java and ActiveX technologies) have made
  certain attacks easier to carry out.  Privacy has become an
  important issue for the Internet.

  NDSS '97 will bring together researchers, implementors, and users
  of network and distributed system technologies to discuss today's
  important security issues and challenges.  We have selected the
  technical papers and panel presentations that describe promising
  new approaches to security problems that are practical, and to
  the extent possible, have been implemented.  Topics to be addressed
  include Internet infrastructure and routing security, security
  for the World Wide Web, Java and ActiveX security, cryptographic
  protocols, public key management, and protection of privacy.

  The symposium will have a positive impact on the state of Internet
  security.  You will have the opportunity to actively participate
  in the dialog.  Ask questions of the speakers, raise your important
  issues during the panel sessions, and let other participants know
  of your requirements, observations, and experience in this
  important area.  We hope to encourage the wide-scale deployment
  of security technologies and to promote new research that can
  address the currently unmet security needs of the Internet
  community.

Call for Papers:
6CYBERCONF
Sixth International Conference on Cyberspace
June 5th to 8th, 1997. University of Oslo

Website: http://televr.fou.telenor.no/cyberconf

We already live part-time in cyberspace, and that time is increasing as
fast as the quality of the experience is radically changing.  The Sixth
International Conference on Cyberspace addresses the social, political and
cultural implications of cyberspace from a critical as well as
practical standpoint. In the nets, there is a growing society that ranges
from researchers to Silicon Valley sophisticates to neocyberpunks.
6CYBERCONF offers the opportunity for exchange within and between these
confluent and diverse interests and encourages discussion between
theoreticians and practitioners. Hosted for the second time in Europe, this
sixth edition of CYBERCONF considers: cyborgs looking for a home, the
future body, interface/interaction breakthroughs, and the importance of
collaboration in virtual environments.

CONFERENCE FORMAT

The official opening of 6CYBERCONF is scheduled for Thursday afternoon,
June 5th. The conference will take place over three and a half days. There
will be 6 keynote speakers, 15 plenary sessions, electronic art
installations, special events, a pre- conference workshop on immersive
environment design, and a banquet dinner on Saturday June 7th.  All
sessions are designed to foster discussion. Presentations will be in
English. The themes are:

CYBERSPACE METAPHOR?
The cyberspace metaphor is a means of effecting instantaneous fusion of two
separate realms of experience (man/machine, good/bad, self/world) into one
illuminating, iconic, encapsulating image. Is the metaphor still a way to
proceed from the known to the unknown in cyberspace? Is the metaphor a
critical synthesis of complex communications technologies, bio-sociality or
techno-sociality? Is cyberspace a new metanarrative of progress, or a story
of paradise lost?  Which language for the virtual age?

VIRTUAL SUBJECTS ON THE ROAD
A cyborg is a double articulation in which we find both the end of the
subject and a new dispersed and refracted subjectivity constructed in
cyberspace. The fabric of cyberspace dresses us in the cloth of
possibilities -the virtual subject as a switchboard of souls?  Can we
really construct and reconstruct any identities and personalities?  Will
not the "real" subject implode in its multiplicity?  Or is it a question of
mastering ones avatar puppets on a global playground?  Do we need
psychiatrists for avatars?  Logged off, where does the will of the
cyberpersonality go?

HACKING THE FUTURE BODY
McLuhan argued that electronic media reintegrated the senses. How are
bodies represented through information technology? How can cyberspace give
priority to the lower senses?  How is desire constructed through virtual
worlds?  Are there darker domains of e-motional interference beyond the
emoticons? Is there a "violence of connectivity"? What about cybersex?  Are
we masturbating our way into the year 2000?  Will sexuality become a post-
biological phenomenon? Is the future body a recombinant structure of flesh
or schizoid realities?

ZONES / INTER-ACTION
i) INTER-FACE is the sensitive boundary zone of negotiation between human
and machine, allowing seamless crossings between the worlds:  Facilitating
the disappearance of the difference between them - emerging new set of
human/machine relations - interweaving calculation, simulation and
post-modern culture. How can we design for tacit knowledge and bricolage?
How can we account for differing incentive structures between designers and
users?  Which concealed design codes promote or dissemble functionality?
How to extend the interface into social/material space, transforming it
into an environmental power? Away from the daily prayer at the desktop,
when technology becomes transparent and disappears, where will it take us?
ii) The rapid development of Internet and WWW have limited the definition
of INTER-ACTION as the click of the mouse.  How can interaction become a
mutual and simultaneous activity on the part of the participants
(man-machine-man interaction) in art and education?  If the computer adds
an interference to communication, how can it be used creatively?  What is
interaction beyond the Web?

LABORATORIES FOR COLLABORATION
Many of us are today involved in group interaction through
telecommunication networks.  In the future the 2D interface of the web will
shift to 3D interactive interfaces. How will this affect the way we
perceive our collaborators and our usage of information?  Will it be a
preferred medium to social interaction - opening up new possibilities
within a group, organisation or community?

INCLUSION - EXCLUSION
What about the politics of networks? Which impact will commerce have on the
the internet community?  How will the powerstructures of the internet
affect the behaviour of netizens?  What about the diversity of cyberspace
cultures?  What is "freedom of speech" in a global context?

Subject: File 5--DC-ISOC Tidbits

Hello DC-ISOC,

I hope your New Year is off to a good start.

This message contains a couple of requests and a half-day conference
announcement that should be of interest to many of you...

Russ Haynal

=========================================================================
Want to go to CommNET ???

CommNET Is a large industry conference and trade show being held NEXT WEEK
in the Washington Convention Center.  If you have never been able to make
it to CommNET, I am happy to provide you with just the excuse/opportunity
you need to attend this great show.

The Internet Society (ISOC) has been given a booth for the show.  ISOC will
provide  someone at all times to manage the booth.  However, the Internet
Society is seeking additional volunteers to help staff the booth.  A Key
responsibility would be to accept new member registrations.  A Secondary
responsibility would be to answer questions and hand-out literature.
"Working the booth" is  a great way to meet many people and share your
knowledge about the Internet/ISOC.

The Convention floor hours are 10-6 on February 4-6.  Volunteers would only
have to work one (or more) 2-4 hour shifts.

Volunteers should be ISOC members, or people who will sign up as
members.  (It doesn't make a lot of sense to have someone in the booth
talking up ISOC and not spending $35 to be a member.)

Anyone interested in volunteering or finding our more details should
contact Mary Burger at the Internet Society Headquarters (703-648-9888).  A
CommNET Booth is a great opportunity for ISOC, please help to make this a
success.

================================================================================
DC-ISOC Meeting Locations...

As always, the DC-ISOC would like to hear any leads you may have on (free)
meeting places in the DC metro region, large enough to hold 200 people.
We were able to hold our last meeting at the Marriot Hotel, thanks to the
costs being absorbed by Network Solutions ( http://www.netsol.com ).  If
your organization is interested in covering the costs of a DC-ISOC meeting,
please contact Russ Haynal (russ@navigators.com or 703-729-1757)  Sponsors
do receive visibility/recognition to the DC-ISOC Membership (Mailing list
includes over 1500 Internet industry participants located mostly in the DC
Metro area)

Conference Announcement....


Digital Dilemmas: Defining Ethics in the Internet Age

The Internet revolution has sparked a fierce debate among the business,
academic, computer, and public policy communities. Today, we are grappling
with complex ethical questions such as
*       Must society ensure that all people have equal access to the Internet?
*       Can we bridge the gap between network haves and have-nots?
*       Can the Internet remain a haven for free expression, discreet
information consumption, and private transactions?
*       Can we strike a balance between individual interests and
commercialism on the Internet?

These new-age questions defy easy answers. They demand new-age solutions.
Take part in the debate. Attend Marymount University's conference,
Digital Dilemmas: Defining Ethics in the Internet Age.


Ethics, Access, and the Internet

This conference is for high-tech companies, consumer advocates, cybernauts,
academicians, and policy makers who are surveying the landscape of ethical
considerations in the Internet Age. Along with the changing structure of
communications within our society, we are faced with ethical dilemmas of
*       Equal access
*       Free speech
*       Intellectual property
*       Privacy
*       Regulation
*       Electronic commerce
Marymount has assembled an impressive cadre of speakers and panelists who
are at the forefront of ethical debate in the Internet Age.
Join us for this half-day conference as we explore the controversial issues
of ethics, access, and the Internet.


Panel One:

Moving Beyond the Wire: Who Gains? Who's Left Behind?

Whose Internet is it, anyway? Popular opinion holds that the Internet is
the great equalizer. No one knows whether you're rich or poor, urban or
rural, young or old. No one knows your gender, race, or education.
The push is on to wire up our schools, homes, and businesses. But what
happens to those who aren't willing or able to get connected? Will they be
left out of future political and social debates? Will they miss out on
economic opportunities? Is the Internet setting up exclusion criteria,
information elites, electronic inequities? What is the impact of the
Internet on our society and our economy? What's the role of government and
the private sector in ensuring equal access?

Panel Two:

Uncharted Waters:  Privacy, Intellectual Property, and the First Amendment

With the unexpected and explosive growth of the Internet, governments,
regulating agencies, and individuals in a position of public trust or
public office have begun to recognize the power of this new communications
medium. In the interest of "protecting" their constituencies, many powerful
interests are getting involved. Recently, the issues of privacy,
intellectual property, and First Amendment rights have come under intense
scrutiny, but precious few legal decisions have charted our course.
Are we adrift in a sea of unresolved legal and ethical quandaries? Is the
Internet headed for the rocks? Will proposed "solutions" render the
Internet powerless? Will free marketers and brash commercialism sail over
the free sharing of information? Should technology influence culture or
vice versa?

  NEW EDITION OF O'REILLY'S CLASSIC NUTSHELL HANDBOOK "DNA AND BIND"

SEBASTOPOL, CA-O'Reilly & Associates announces the publication of the
second edition of "DNS and BIND," a complete guide to the Internet's
Domain Name System (DNS) and the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND)
software, the UNIX implementation of DNS. The new edition also covers
using DNS and BIND with Windows NT. It's a complete update of this
classic Nutshell Handbook, which has served as *the* source of
information on DNS and BIND for system administrators who manage domain
or name servers.

DNS is the system that translates hostnames (like "rock.ora.com") into
Internet addresses (like 192.54.67.23). Until BIND was developed, name
translation was based on a "host table"; if you were on the Internet,
you got a table that listed all the systems connected to the Net and
their addresses. As the Internet grew from hundreds to hundreds of
thousands of systems, host tables became unworkable. DNS is a
distributed database that solves the same problem effectively, allowing
the Net to grow without constraints.  Rather than having a central
table that gets distributed to every system on the Net, it allows local
administrators to assign their own hostnames and addresses and install
these names in a local database. This database is automatically
distributed to other systems as names are needed.

In this new edition of "DNS and BIND," the authors describe Bind
version 4.8.3, which is included in most vendor implementations today.
In addition, readers will find complete coverage of Bind 4.9.4, which
in all probability will be adopted as the new standard in the near
future.

In addition to covering the basic motivation behind DNS and how to set
up the BIND software, this book covers many more advanced topics,
including how to become a "parent" (i.e., "delegate" the ability to
assign names to someone else); how to use DNS to set up mail forwarding
correctly; debugging and troubleshooting; and programming.

          O'REILLY RELEASES "MASTERING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"

SEBASTOPOL, CA--Programmers who delve into O'Reilly and Associates'
new book "Mastering Regular Expressions" can save themselves time and
aggravation while dealing with documents, mail messages, log files--any
type of text or data--by tapping the power of regular expressions. For
example, regular expressions can play a vital role in constructing a
World Wide Web CGI script, which can involve text and data of all
sorts. Those who don't use regular expressions yet will discover a
whole new world of mastery over their data in "Mastering Regular
Expressions." Experienced users will appreciate the book's
unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage.

Regular expressions are not a tool in and of themselves, but are
included as part of a larger utility. The classic example is grep.
These days, regular expressions can be found everywhere, such as in:
  - scripting languages (including Perl, Tcl, awk, and Python)
  - editors (including Emacs, vi, and Nisus Writer)
  - programming environments (including Delphi and Visual C++)
  - specialized tools (including lex, Expect, and sed)

While many of these tools originated on UNIX, they are now available
for a wide variety of platforms, including DOS/Windows and MacOS.
Additionally, many favorite programming languages (even Java) offer
regular-expression libraries, so programmers can include support for
them in their own programs.

For years, author Jeffrey Friedl has helped people on the Net
understand and use regular expressions. In "Mastering Regular
Expressions" he goes beyond mechanics and initiates readers to the art
of using regular expressions.  Friedl shares the subtle but valuable
ways to think when using regular expressions as he leads readers
through the process of crafting a regular expression to get the job
done.

Regular expressions are not used in a vacuum. In this book, a variety
of tools are examined and used in an extensive array of examples. Perl,
in particular, is very well represented throughout the book, with a
major chapter dedicated entirely to it alone. Perl is extremely
well-endowed with rich and expressive regular expressions. Yet what is
power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the
unwary--"Mastering Regular Expressions" shows readers how to navigate
the minefield and become true masters of the art of regular
expressions.

%T   "The Basics of Computer Security"

Essentially, this series of three short video tapes contains the rough
equivalent of three introductory chapters of a basic security
text.  There is an introduction to computer security in general,
an introduction to application security, and an introduction to
application security review or audit.  The material is presented
at a level suitable to the user, or perhaps a non-technical
manager.

The format is the standard talking head interspersed with slides.
The material on the slides is reprinted in booklets packaged with
the tapes.  The content is generally reliable, although sometimes
the advice on minor matters is questionable.  Overall
organization is good, but some sections are poorly planned and
repetitive.
