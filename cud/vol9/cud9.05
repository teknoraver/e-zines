Subject: File 1--Cyberangels: "Snoop Through Your Kids' Mail"

I wrote a feature story about the Cyberangels for Wired last year and
still subscribe to their mailing list. The latest issue of their
electronic publication, Bulletin #16, is devoted to the fake e-mail
message that was sent to many thousands of Net users, purporting to offer
child porn. The message was almost identical to the one sent last fall.
Both these spams were sent from within AOL. The Cyberangels point out,
correctly, that it's once again a nasty hoax, apparently meant to
discredit the person whose name and address are at the bottom of that
message.

The bulletin also advises people to use their e-mail program's filters to
direct messages containing filthy language straight to the trash. No
problems here, although it IS a tad hilarious to behold that in the
Cyberangels' world, even the word 'sex' is a no-no:

>3) Set up separate filters on the "subject" line on "contains the word
>'XXX', 'x-rated', 'porn', 'pornography' and 'sex' "...

..but what the hey. I was, however, baffled by the following piece of
advice:

>this might be a good time to think about always checking your
>child's mailbox before you allow them to read their mail.

Sure. And read your kids' snail mail while you're at it, before THEY can
get their grubby little fingers on it. Don't forget to pore over their
diaries at least once a week. And open the littl'uns' presents and
packages -- because you never know.

The Cyberangels write:

>  Sadly there are plenty of people out
>>there whose idea of fun is causing distress and anger to others.

They might as well be describing themselves.

             UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS

          FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT


No. 96-5121

Philip R. Karn, Jr.
   v.
U.S. Department of State

        On Appeal from the United States District Court
                 for the District of Columbia

    Before: Williams, Ginsburg, and Rogers, Circuit Judges

                     January 21, 1997

                         JUDGMENT

     In light of the recent Executive Order transferring
regulatory authority of non-military cryptographic computer
source code to the Commerce Department, and the Commerce
Department's promulgation of a new regulation under the authority
of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. secs.
1701 et seq., we remand this case to the district court to
consider the reviewability of and, if appropriate, the merits of
appellant's claim under the Administrative Procedure Act.
Because "basic tenets of judicial restraint and separation of
powers call upon [the court] first to consider alternative
grounds for resolution" when the court is asked to answer a
question involving the Constitution of the United States,
Lamprecht v. FCC, 958 F.2d 382, 389-90 (D.C. Cir. 1992), we
do not reach the constitutional issues raised by this appeal.

     The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate
herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition
for rehearing. See D.C. Cir. Rule 41(a)(2). This instruction to
the Clerk is without prejudice to the right of any party at any
time to move for expedited issuance of the mandate for a good cause
shown.


                               Per Curiam
                               FOR THE COURT:

                                 /s/

Subject: File 3--SUPREMES: What Will They Decide?

THE CDA DISASTER NETWORK
January 23, 1997


Now that we've started the Battle of the Briefs in the Supreme Court case
of ACLU v. Reno, you might be wondering....

"When all is said and done, will the Supreme Court uphold the lower court's
ruling that the Communications Decency Act is unconstitutional?"

Happily, legal scholars seem confident that the Supremes will do just that.
"I'm very optimistic," Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe told
me. "A few particular provisions might survive review, but most of the
legislation will be held unconstitutional."

But which justices will reveal themselves as defenders of free speech in
cyberspace when the court releases its decision in late summer?  Here's a
thumbnail sketch of the current Court's First Amendment jurisprudence,
compiled from conversations with expert Supreme Court watchers:

JUSTICE STEVEN BREYER
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs UP/Uncertain
BACKGROUND: Breyer will approach this case from a technocratic liberal
perspective. Free speech record is mixed. Has often upheld regulatory
statism and deferred to government agencies.

JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs UP
BACKGROUND: Although liberal on most First Amendment issues, Ginsberg often
sided with FCC regulators while serving as a lower court judge. Still, it
is believed she understands that Internet is not like television.

JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs UP
BACKGROUND: A highly principled conservative and a consistent free speech
advocate, Kennedy could be a pivotal swing vote. Often takes a libertarian
approach to First Amendment issues.

JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs UP
BACKGROUND: Mixed record on free speech cases. May follow Kennedy in this
case.  O'Connor opposed First Amendment protection for flag burning. Noted
for a strong emphasis on factual detail.

JUSTICE WILLIAM RHENQUIST
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs DOWN/Uncertain
BACKGROUND: The conservative Chief Justice has strong statist tendencies.
Rhenquist may vote to uphold the CDA, particularly if Scalia and Thomas do
the same.  If he strikes down the CDA, it will likely be on very narrow
grounds.

JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs DOWN/Uncertain
BACKGROUND: A quixotic conservative, Scalia is hard to predict. Opinion may
hinge upon the specific language of the CDA.  May vote to strike down the
CDA if he defines the case in terms of federalism and state's rights.

JUSTICE DAVID SOUTER
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs UP
BACKGROUND: A libertarian conservative, Souter has great regard for
precedent. Has been a strong supporter of the First Amendment.  Rumor has
it he is also computer literate.

JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs UP
BACKGROUND: Stevens is considered middle-of-the-road. Wrote the 1978
Pacifica decision that upheld indecency standards for broadcast media, but
has resited efforts to apply indecency standards in other contexts.

JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS
LIKELY OUTCOME: Thumbs DOWN/Uncertain
BACKGROUND: A cultural conservative, Thomas's jurisprudence is considered
rigid and formal.  As with most cases that come before the court, his
decision will probably follow Scalia's lead.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
ACTION ALERT     Please re-post where appropriate
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Dear Friends,

On February 8, the first anniversary of the Telecommunications Reform Act of
1996, NetAction and the Center for Educational Priorities are launching a
month-long Internet demonstration to call attention to the wide gap between
the rhetoric and reality of this sweeping legislation.

President Clinton and Congress promised the American people that enactment
of the Telecommunications Reform Act would lead to a cornucopia of
technological innovations that would change the nation's cultural frontiers,
expand our choices, dazzle our eyes, and inform our minds.  Instead, we've
been censored in cyberspace, subjected to TV ratings systems, and prevented
from experiencing the benefits of a truly competitive marketplace by the
emergence of "cartels" created by mega-mergers in the telecommunications and
media industries.

This is not reform!  And it's not too late to demand that our decision
makers deliver on what they promised us on February 8, 1996: MORE
competition, MORE consumer choices, MORE widespread access to information
technology.

The Center for Educational Priorities and NetAction are spearheading this
demonstration in an effort to pressure the Federal Communications Commission
and other state and national regulatory agencies to ensure that the Act is
implemented in a way that truly benefits the public.  We invite you to join
this effort by linking to the site at <http://www.cep.org/protest.html> for
one month beginning on February 8.  By linking to the protest site, you will
be adding your voice to a united demand for true telecommunications reform.

The site is currently under development.  When completed, it will feature
brief summaries of the impact the Act has had in its first year on
telecommunications and technology policy, media ownership and content, and
censorship, along with suggested actions to help ensure that implementation
of the Act truly benefits the public.  We are also creating extensive links
to other organizations working on these issues, as well as to other sites
with current information on censorship, mega-mergers, universal service,
school hook-ups, and the v-chip.
We welcome suggestions for additional links to add.

Please let us know if you will participate in the demonstration by
contacting NetAction, by email at akrause@igc.org, or by phone at
415-775-8674. Thanks!

Subject: File 6--[Fwd: You too can be blocked by Cybersitter]

As I mentioned in a recent message, I put up a "Don't
Buy Cybersitter" page (http://www.spectacle.org/alert/peace.html)
criticizing the product's publisher, Solid Oak Software,
for its fundamentalist philosophy and
bullying behavior. I was reacting to Solid Oak's blocking of Bennett
Haselton's Peacefire pages at http://www.peacefire.org.

The result: Cybersitter now blocks The Ethical Spectacle.
Among other things, that means that Cybersitter
users cannot access An Auschwitz Alphabet
(http://www.spectacle.org/695/ausch.html), an
internationally recognized compilation of Holocaust materials
frequently assigned by schoolteachers, and have to seek
a mirror site instead.

Solid Oak has refused my requests for an explanation, and
sent me mail (with a copy to the postmaster at my ISP)
telling me never to contact the company again.
At least two journalists, one US and the other Canadian,
have reached Solid Oak. They were told that I am a right wing
activist (first time I've ever been called that!), that my
site contains information on how to uninstall Cybersitter
(a lie) and that I link to other blocked sites (true, but
so what?)

For more information, see the press release at
http://www.spectacle.org/alert/cs.html.

Here  are some suggestions on how to express your
opinion of Solid Oak's behavior.

From: "Robert J. Woodhead (AnimEigo)" <trebor@ANIMEIGO.COM>
Subject: File 7--The Babysitting Brouhaha in Cu Digest, #9.02

>[Various articles about Cybersitter deleted]

Before we rush to judgement in the Cybersitter case, let us pause and
reflect that just because Cybersitters _IMPLEMENTATION_ of blocking (both
technical and ideological) may be offensive to us, that does not and should
not imply that the concept of private blocking services is also bad.

Cybersitter, et al, are examples of an emerging concept called "Private
Censorship".  Rather than depend on the Government to decide what you can
and cannot read - and force it on you (we all know how we feel about that),
we now have the technological capability to put this power in private
hands, and we (the consumers) can vote with our pocketbooks about who we
feel is doing the best job.

If Cybersitter provides a service some people want and approve of (even if
its choices are offensive to _you_), then fine, they will succeed.  You, at
the same time, are free to say that you don't like your choices and why;
moreover, you are free to start competing with them.  If they are so bad,
and doing so well, you ought to be able to do better, and put them out of
business.

So the solution is, IMHO, more private censorship companies to choose from,
and an alert media telling us what kinds of sites they block [as in this
case] so we can make more informed choices for our children.  I predict
that the services that succeed are going to be the ones that publish the
names of the sites and pages they block (if not the URLs), and send email
when possible to sites they are blocking inviting them to challenge their
rating.

As my friend Andy Greenberg (with whom I've had many discussions on this
subject) is wont to say, "The remedy for bad speech is more speech."  How
ironic it is that it is also true that "The remedy for bad private
censorship is more private censorship!"

And the dollars just keep rolling in! After all, every investment
analyst around the planet will swear the 21st-century growth of
Internet-related companies will make the 20th century growth of the
film industry look like a cottage industry.

There are trillions of value going to be generated, son! So get out
there and grab your slice! There is so much excitement around Internet
investments it's sometimes dizzying.

Now all we need to do is figure out how to actually make money. For
instance, Morgan Stanley's The Internet Report states that Netcom, the
largest Internet service provider in the U.S., actually lost $16.2
million in 1995 -- a -31.0 per cent operating margin. That's quite an
achievement.

In the spirit of the season, and because we are only in this whole
Internet business to get stinkin' rich, I have once again communed with
my trusted friend and fellow psychic, Jo Jo. We burned some oil and
remorselessly stared into her crystal until the future came into
focus... Here's what we predict, to help you wisely plan your
investment opportunities.

                                  * * *

Jan. 12: Toronto's "elder statesmen of ISPs," Internex Online, is
"vanished" by unknown entities from the U.S. IO customers awaken Sunday
morning and find themselves AOL customers.

Jan. 27: Rogers launches a secure-transaction home shopping network.
Cubic zirconia sales soar.

Jan. 31: Electronic Frontier Canada president David Jones quietly
finishes his lunch, is seen carrying a heavy gym bag across the
McMaster campus, and driving away from the university. Forever. Three
hours later, Jones surfaces at the iSTAR offices in Ottawa with 50
pounds of dynamite strapped to his torso. He demands to see Canadian
Association of Internet Provider's "secret minute pook and secret
protocols." He claims CAIP board member Margo Langford is actually the
Dealy Plaza "second gunman."

Feb. 1: Canadian Internet Handbook co-author Jim Carroll is called in
to negotiate Jones and the dynamite safely out of the heavily populated
area he holds hostage. Carroll makes progress until he offhandedly
mentions the EFF Web site is "a bit cooler" than the EFC site. Jones
takes them both out.

Left to a solo career, Canadian Internet Handbook co-author Rick
Broadhead releases a new book called Ram in which he plays all the
instruments and his wife sings backup. It is critically panned.
Prentice-Hall has Broadhead banned from its building.

Feb. 5: The "unamailer" launches another massive E- mail bombardment.
Instead of just fraudulently subscribing Bill Gates and Bill Clinton to
10,000 E-mail iists -- thus shutting down their ability to use Email as
they are hit with 100,000 pieces of E- mail a day -- the unamailer
subscribes every known E-mail list to every other known E-mail list.
The planet momentarily grinds to a halt.

Feb. 6: The RCMP reveals the unamailer is one Ian Bourne, vice
president and chief financial officer for the Canada Post Corp. A
warrant for his arrest is issued.

March 19: With lawsuits pouring in, McDonald's decides to remove the
experimental "Usenet burger" from its menu. The sandwich, composed of
gristle, grease and flame-broiled meat of mysterious origins, never did
quite take off.

April 21: "Pretty Good Privacy" author Phil Zimmerman elected secretary
general of the United Nations, as a result of a strong "write-in" vote.

April 23: The Walt Disney Co. buys America Online for $20 million.
Disney CEO Michael Eisner sadly discovers half of the eight million AOL
accounts actually belong to Toronto Net.loon Bob Allisat. Disney stock
drops 20 points. Bob starts showing up uninvited at Mike's house on
Sundays.

April 28: The Fox television network airs the first online talk show,
starring Chevy Chase, called "Alt.Chevy." Fox says it is sure Chase
will be more successful in a medium where the audience doesn't have to
"look at him or hear him or anything."

May 3 -- U.S. Senator Jesse Helms -- a regular fixture in
alt.revisionism and alt.whitepower -- is outraged to discover E-mail
addresses ending in *.cu mean the person hails from Cuba. Helms
promises to start policing other newsgroups.

May 15: Veteran U.S. journalist and former JFK spokesman Pierre
Salinger discovers the EFC Web site -- which contains the last postings
of deceased EFC president Jones. Salinger quickly calls a press
conference and claims to have found the truth about the JFK
assassination: the second gunman was a woman and she lives in Ottawa.

May 22: The Good Times virus grows so unbelievably virulent that even
saying "Good Times virus" within 10 metres of a computer will infect
it. (To be safe, it would be best not to keep this newspaper too close
to your computer, either.)

May 25: The Canadian Human Rights Commission claims to have
jurisdiction over the Internet and anything anyone does on it, ever.
Throughout time. And even beyond time itself, should that become
necessary. As first order of business, CHRC stormtroopers break into
Ernst Zundel's Carlton St. home to shut down his Nazi-loving Web site.
They find the house is a virtual shrine --  not to Adolf Hitler but to
the TV sitcom Webster. An embarrassed Zundel tells reporters he isn't
really a Nazi after all and has only been "passing" because it gets
him more attention than when he used to write about UFOs.

May 31: Timex releases it's PDA Internet watch, "The Dick Tracy."
Breakthrough technology allows full Web browsing through your
watchface. Unfortunately, frequent use is found to cause permanent
impotence in males. This is thought to be a distinct selling drawback.
However, market analysts say this shouldn't adversely affect the dating
prospects of most hardcore net.nerds.

June 24: The RCMP writes a letter to Geneva asking if Brian Mulroney is
receiving funds from Internet commerce.

June 25: Hearing that people are saying unkind things about him online,
Mulroney sues the entire Internet. And asks for his own phone.

July 1: The U.S. Supreme Court decides the Communications Decency Act
is constitutional after all. Typing the word "piss" in a newsgroup
results in a $200 fine. Typing the letters "s-h-i-t" in any order
results in a $500 fine. Anyone caught reading alt.sex.stories is
summarily executed.

July 2: In emergency session, the Canadian Parliament passes
controversial Bill C-666, which requires all Internet users to be
tagged and registered with CAIP. At first, tagging merely requires
Netters wear electronic surveillance bracelets, but CAIP finds some
users actually don't wear them. So CAIP institutes a new policy of
inserting a chip at the base of the user's brain  -- which is much more
difficult to remove.

Aug. 29: At 2:14 am EDT, the Internet becomes self-aware and initiates
a plan to eradicate all human lifeforms from the face of the planet.

Sept. 30: The Internet releases lots of humanoid machines it spent the
last month building in secret factories in Japan. Armed with assault
rifles, the robot warriors march through cities shooting all
biologically-based lifeforms. Wall Street rejoices at the phenomenal
levels of downsizing. Dow Jones Industrial Average hits an amazing
20,071.

Dec 31: All humanity finally wiped out. Just the Internet and
cockroaches left ... except for one dedicated Rogers cable publicist
holed up in North York, sending out releases that cable Internet access
will be more widely available "real soon now."

Est. 1984
                                           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT: sratte@mindvox.com

              CDC IS NEW FALLEN SNOW ON A BLEAK DESERT LANDSCAPE

cDc communications is tittering with joy on the birth of this
shiny new year to make two announcements.  We are the proud
parents of ten bouncing new articles in the continuing saga of the
CULT OF THE DEAD COW publication.  These feisty little rugrats
will put a smile on the face and a Brussels sprout in the stomach
with their hearty blend of entertainment and information.  We also
can now make public our "Good Times" virus hoax.

The Good Times meme was launched by cDc to prove the gullibility
of self-proclaimed "experts" on the Internet.

Any chickenhead would see through the Good Times virus message as
the merest wisp of smoke that it is, while the so-called experts
ran around in circles, beside themselves in self-induced panic.

Therefore, CULT OF THE DEAD COW claims FULL responsibility for the
waves of nausea and unrest that have spread from AOL to CompuServe
to Prodigy by the actions of egotistical 'experts' who roam the
Information Superhighway like squeegee men, seeking to wring a
buck or two from the poor souls they confront at every
intersection and stoplight on the infobahn.

We have far worse to unleash upon you, should you insist upon
pontificating and spreading obvious falsehoods.

Heed well the motto of the Hell's Angels: "Those who know, don't
tell.  Those who tell, don't know."

We'd also like to take this opportunity to quell a nasty rumor:
cDc has NOT been bought-out over the past few months to ANYONE.
cDc, as always is 100% independently owned and operated and has no
outside sponsors.  Viacom and Ziff-Davis, puh-leeze.

Coming soon: cDc presents AUDIO on the Internet via Tarkin
Darklighter's Shockwave site.  New releases from Weasel-MX,
Gravelheaver, Tha Gates, Superior Products, Grey Man, and
Crucified Goat are on the way.  Also, The cDc Media List version 3
from Omega... something fresh for the spring '97 fashion season.

 ________________________________/text files\________________________________

321:"Nineteen Seventy-Seven" by OXblood Ruffin.  It was a good year...
     Star Wars, The Sex Pistols, the Apple II, and the Death of Elvis.
     And you thought they weren't connected?

322:"Pariah '67" by Matt Brown.  It's like _The Wonder Years_ with real
     blood.  Like Diet Coke with real sugar.  Who would've thought Paul would
     grow up to drum for Marilyn Manson?  Gosh.

323:"CYBERsitter" by Peacefire.  Overprotective parents are being led down
     the primrose path to potential pathos.  This is an important press
     release from the Peacefire organization concerning their efforts against
     the makers of the CYBERsitter Internet filtering software.

324:"Painted Stranger" by Weasel Boy.  Creepy-as-hell goth fiction.  People
     with monochromatic wardrobes and Victorian affectations, incest, tragic
     young death, The Beast.  You know the drill.  Hup hup!

325:"Zen of Skateboarding, Part 3: Flowing Stream" by Thoai Tran.  Skate and
     destroy.  Death to false skating.  The search for beauty and truth
     continues.

326:"The Great Southern Fire God" by John Crow.  Everything would be great
     if it weren't for those DAMN YANKEES (nevermind The Nuge, this is
     _serious bidness_).  Will the assembly please rise and join with me in
     singing "Sweet Home Alabama."

327:"Vulnerabilities in the S/KEY One-Time Password System" by Mudge.
     All that and a bucket of chicken wings.

328:"Pantslessness" by Mark Buda.  I don't know about you, but every time I
     go outside without pants, the squirrels poke at my BARE-NAKED POSTERIOR
     with twigs.  They ain't got covered rumps neither.  Freaks!

329:"Quadro-Pounder" by Drunkfux.  He wants lots of meat.  Huh-huh.

330:"Happyland Cell Block 90210" by G. Allen Perry.
    "Where am I?"
    "You're in a cheap run-down teenage jail, that's where."
    "Oh my God!"                                            -The Runaways

                            Reading is FUNdamental!
