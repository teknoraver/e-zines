                  The 1997 Summer Security Conference

                            "SUMMERCON IX.V"

			    May 31st, 1997

			     Atlanta, GA

  This is the official announcement and open invitation to the nine
and 1/2 summer security conference, Summercon.  A long time ago,
Summercon was an invite-only hacker gathering held annually in St.
Louis, Missouri. Starting in 1995, SummerCon became an open event to
any and all interested parties:  Hackers, Phreaks, Pirates, Virus
Writers, System Administrators, Law Enforcement Officials,
Vigilantes, Neo-Hippies, Secret Agents, Teachers, Disgruntled
Employees, Telco Flunkies, Journalists, New Yorkers, Programmers,
Conspiracy Nuts, Musicians, Nudists, and Rug Sucking Wannabes.
  This con is going to be different than previous SummerCons.  First
off, there are two other major cons happening this summer, Defcon
and Beyond HOPE.  If you want to see good technical speakers, meet a
ton of hackers, and have a good time for a couple days, I suggest
you go to one or both of those cons.  DefCon information is at
http://www.defcon.org, Beyond HOPE info is at http://www.2600.com.

  So why have SummerCon at all?  Well, its a tradition, and most
of the people I talked to said we should have it anyways.  But,
because of the other 2 cons, I am really aiming just to make this
a fun weekend with yer friends in a new city, not a technical
hacker gala.  If you want to learn something, go to HOPE or
Defcon.  If you want to meet hackers, go to HOPE or DefCon.  If
you have to choose one con to go to this summer, this one should
NOT be it.  If you are already going to DefCon and HOPE, and still
have one more weekend you want to waste this summer, this is the
perfect place for you.
  If you are a criminal, if you are an anarchist, if you are
interested in pulling fire alarms or breaking things, don't come
to this con; we don't want you here and you wouldn't like us
anyhow.
  Why 9.5?  Well, SummerCon X should be this huge major security
conference, but with HOPE this year, we didn't think it was the
right year to do another one of those.  So, we'll have SummerCon X
next year, this one is just going to be a little party.


LOCATION

It will be held in Atlanta, GA, but we haven't actually figured
out WHERE in Atlanta.  That's because this is a pre-release of the
announcement, when this becomes official, we'll fill in the
details.


DIRECTIONS

Fly to Hartsfield International Airport, look for the hackers.


CONFERENCE INFO

It has always been our contention that cons are for socializing.
"Seekret Hacker InPh0" is never really discussed except in private
circles, so the only way anyone is going to get any is to meet new
people and take the initiative to start interesting conversations.

Because of this, the formal speaking portion of Summercon will be
held on one day, not two or three, leaving plenty of time for
people to explore the city, compare hacking techniques, or go
trashing and clubbing with their heretofore unseen online
companions.  Futhermore, except for maybe getting Mudge up on
stage to blow us all away with some cool technical details, it is
probably a pretty good bet that the speeches will end up being
boring, long, and a complete waste of time.  Don't come to
SummerCon to learn anything, because you won't.

If you are coming from out of town and want the full
hacker/tourist experience, we will be having a specially scheduled
2600 meeting Friday, May 30th, at 6pm at Lenox Mall food court.
If you don't know how to get there, just ask, everyone in Atlanta
knows.

The formal conference will be held on Saturday, May 31st, 1997,
from 10am to 5pm (with a break for lunch).  There will be a
variety of speakers, panel discussions, demonstrations, and other
events that will hopefully keep everyone entertained; if not you
can always start drinking early.

No video or audio tapes will be allowed in the conference room.
No still photography will be permitted in the conference room
without prior permission of all those being photographed.
Violation of these policies will result in you being asked to
leave the conference.

There will be no selling of t-shirts, disks, firewalls, payphones,
etc. in or around the conference area without prior permission of
the organizers, and you WON'T get permission.  We can't keep you
from selling t-shirts in your hotel room, but we can keep you away
from the actual conference area, and we can probably get you
kicked out of the hotel for soliciting, and if we can, we will.
T-Shirt sales is where we make up all the money we spend putting
on the conference, and so we will be the only ones selling them.
If you want to sell t-shirts, go have your own con.

If you are interested in demoing or selling something, please
contact us at the address listed at the bottom.  If you offer us
money, we might let you do it.


SPEAKERS

The speakers list for Summercon X is still being finalized, but it
is sure to be much less interesting than previous years.  In fact,
right now we have NO speakers, and probably we won't until the day
of the con.  So again, don't come to summercon for the speakers.

If you are an expert in some aspect of computer, network, or telco
security and are interested in speaking at Summercon, please
contact us to discuss the possibility further at the address
listed at the end of this document.. We won't pay you, don't ask.

We are also going to be having short speeches by real hackers or
phreakers giving their own perspective on some issue or insight
into a new technology.  This is an open invitation for you hackers
to be heard; just provide us with a brief outline of the topic you
will be covering and the amount of time you will take (suggested:
5 - 15 minutes) at the address listed below.


COSTS

Costs for SummerCon X are as follows, these are same rates as last
year, which I think is pretty good.  There will be NO refunds, and
if you annoy any of the organizers, we reserve the right to throw
you out, and you won't get your money back.

      Secret Service / FBI Rate: $500.00
Government / Institutional Rate: $ 80.00
       Hacker / Individual Rate: $ 20.00


Members of the United States Secret Service or Federal Bureau of
Investigations, and anyone that has in the past or currently is
providing information or services to the Secret Service or FBI are
required to pay the 'Secret Service / FBI Rate'.

Employees of a local, state, or federal government, members and
associates of any L.E.O., must pay the 'Government / Institutional
Rate'.

Anyone that does not fit into one of the above categories is
eligible for the 'Individual / Hacker Rate'.

Due to historical lack of interest, there will not be
pre-registration for the conference.  Registration will begin at
10am the day of the conference, and will continue for the duration
of the conference or until the meeting facilities have reached their
capacity.  Since the latter is likely to occur, it is suggested you
don't oversleep.

No purchase orders, checks, money orders, foreign currency, stock
certificates, IOUs, or coins will be accepted for registration.
Secret Service agents, small unmarked bills only, please.

Bring money for t-shirts, they are cool, and this year we will make
enough for everyone (we hope).

HOTEL INFORMATION

Still working on this part.

The cost for a double occupancy room at the hotel is $XX.  There is
no special conference rate, there is no need to mention you are with
a conference at all, the people in reservations probably won't know
what you are talking about anyhow.

If the hotel is damaged in any manner, you are going to pay for it,
and you will probably end up in jail.  And even if you are lucky
enough to get away with it, the rest of the hackers staying at the
hotel will end up paying for it, and I'm sure that's going to make
you a well-liked and respected hacker, especially among some of the
bigger hackers who might feel tempted to inflict bodily harm on
someone who causes any damage to the hotel.  Please act responsibly,
don't drink and drive, chew all your food before you swallow, don't
swallow your gum, and recycle.

Anyhow, if you pull a fire alarm, if you damage a room, if you spit
on the floor, and any of the organizers, or any of their friends
find out, we are going to call the police and have you arrested.  In
fact, we are making a game out of it.  If anyone does any damage to
the hotel, we will give whoever tells us what person or persons did
it $100 in cash if we are able to get that person taken to jail.


CONTACTING SUMMERCON ORGANIZERS


You can contact the Summercon organizers through e-mail.  If you
haven't figured out e-mail yet, you probably shouldn't be coming to
Summercon.

As a final note, if you are planning on coming to Summercon, we
would appreciate you sending e-mail to us with the subject of "GOING
TO SCON" or something similar, just so that we have a rough idea of
how many people are going to show up.

Subject: File 2--[HIP] ("hacking in progress") - How you can help

      --== Hacking In Progress ==--

    8th, 9th and 10th of August 1997
        Near Almere, Netherlands

          http://www.hip97.nl/
             info@hip97.nl



Welcome to the HIP announcement list. We are not
alone! More than 1600 (!) of you subscribed to this
list.

As you probably already know what HIP is about, this
announcement will focus on how you can help us and how
you can stay informed about HIP. Please read the FAQ
for more common questions.


What is HIP?
------------

HIP is a place for hackers, artists, activists and
many, many others to network themselves, both in the
social and electronic sense of the word. HIP is a
do-it-yourself event. We, the organizers, will provide
the infrastructure, such as large tents, showers,
toilets and large amounts of reliable electrical power
and network connectivity. We'll also arrange for a
basic set of workshops and lectures, mainly dealing
with the social and political aspects of information
technology, security, Internet, access to technology,
new developments, cryptography and other 'hacker-
related' topics that come to mind. We are open to
suggestions for other fields of interest.

At this moment we are working on discussions and
workshops about smartcard security, Tempest attacks,
the SPAM threat, virtual communities, cryptography and
the law (Trusted Third Parties and Key Recovery), a
tele-presence experiment, activism on the Net, and
much more.


A do-it-yourself event?
-----------------------

We will absolutely need your help setting up
everything once we're there. HIPcamp will open on
August 5th, three days before HIP starts. If you
decide to join in that early expect some pretty
primitive circumstances. If you don't care about that,
or think that's the best part, you can help build
HIPnet and all other facilities.

We also urgently need you to think now about what it
is you would like to see and do at HIP. Just like
Hacking at the End of the Universe in 1993, we need
lots of people that have ideas for organizing their
own small part of HIP and the organizational talent to
do this without too much help from us.

One of the proven recipes for fun:

* GET a group of friends together in an early stage;
arrange how you're going to get there if you're far
away.

* THINK: Is there something you and your friends would
like to show others, discuss or do there?

* If so: TELL us about it, so we can coordinate, help
or announce things.

* Maybe BUY a nice big army surplus tent for almost
nothing.

* BRING lots of computers and other electronics.

* HOOK it all up once you get there.

* Check out what others have been doing and MEET nice
people, hang out, have fun!

Of course you can also come alone and have lots of
fun, and there will be a huge exhibition tent to set
up computers in. In another big tent there will be
near to a thousand chairs where you can listen to and
participate with panel discussions.

This event will be big, and as said, in this stage
we're looking for people to organize their own chaotic
little part of it. So don't mail us saying "put me on
the list, I want to be a volunteer" when you could say
"I'm xxx and I'd like to do yyy." Tell us what you
need us to do. We could put your workshop or whatever
it is you'd like to do in one of our announcements and
on the website, so people can communicate with you
beforehand. We could make sure there is enough room if
your project requires a lot of space. You name it.

You can use the newsgroup alt.hacking.in.progress to
find people to work with at HIP. Or you can use the
notice board at the website to search for someone to
travel with to HIP. Use it to ask for help or offer
some.

As the days get longer, there will be parts of the
overall organization that need coordination with
volunteers some time before the actual event (workshop
coordination, audiovisual stuff, registration-desk,
bar, network), but now is not yet the time.

This isn't going to be passive entertainment, we all
work together to make it work. Also: HIP is not the
event to buy a computer or get advice on buying one,
and there're not going to be any beginner courses on
using the Internet. If you're not into networking of
some sort, you'll think it's boring.

But if you're very technically inclined, part of some
remote community on the edge of the net, or if the
politics surrounding information technology are just
your thing, HIP is definitely made for you (and by
you, we hope).

HIPcamp will open on August 5th, three days before HIP
starts. If you decide to join in that early expect pretty
primitive circumstances. If you don't care about that,
or think that's the best part, you can help build HIPnet
and all other facilities.

*******************

March 21, 1997

Lieutenant General Kenneth A. Minihan
Director
National Security Agency/Central Security Service
9800 Savage Road
Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000


Dear General Minihan:

The Committee on Commerce has jurisdiction over all matters
relating to interstate and foreign commerce, including commerce
transacted over electronic mediums. One vehicle for interstate and
foreign electronic commerce, the Internet, has experienced
unexpected and exceptional growth. Our Committee has an obligation
to ensure that the growth of electronic commerce over the Internet
and other networks is not stifled by unnecessary or harmful
regulation or policies.  Thus, the Committee will be discussing
what policies best promote electronic commerce over the Internet
and other networks.

The growth and success of the Internet and the World Wide Web as
both a communications tool, and a medium for electronic commerce
is unprecedented. Leading industry estimates indicate that the
number of people using the Internet is increasing at the rate of
more than 100% per year -- few technologies have had such quick
acceptance into the daily activities of Americans. However, the
full potential of the Internet as a means for conducting business
transactions, or electronic commerce, has yet to be achieved. Most
leading experts agree that a developed Internet, and corresponding
intranets, have the capability to be engines for economic growth
for those offering services over the Internet, and also have the
capability to be a means for transforming business operations from
one of paper-intensity to one conducted solely through electronic
communications and transactions.

Unlocking the full potential of the Internet and thus, promoting
the use of electronic commerce has been difficult, in part,
because of existing and perceived barriers, e.g., many consumers
and businesses are concerned with the security and privacy of
transactions that would occur over the Internet. A belief in the
security of information passed over the Internet and through
on-line services that use the public switched network will foster
the continued growth of electronic commerce. Fortunately, the use
of cryptography or encryption, either hardware or software, may
provide a technological aid in the promotion of electronic
commerce. We believe, however, that a sound encryption policy for
both interstate and foreign electronic commerce must balance
users= privacy interests with society=s interest in legitimate law
enforcement and investigative needs and the needs to preserve
national security.

As you know, the U.S. has export restrictions on certain
encryption products that may or may not interfere with the
development of encryption products designed to secure
communications and transactions. These restrictions have been the
subject of recently proposed legislation in committees in both the
House and Senate.

Because of our responsibility over electronic commerce, we seek to
have your views on a number of the issues related to the various
bills.  Therefore, we request that you provide written answers to
the following questions by April 25, 1997: (1) With the
understanding that there are no domestic restrictions on
encryption products, please provide examples where national
security may be jeopardized by the relaxation of current American
export restriction policy, as incorporated in Executive Order
13026 and implemented, in part, in the corresponding Bureau of
Export Administration rules of December 30, 1996. Are there
remedies other than export restrictions that would provide the
United States government the access it needs to encrypted
communications, e.g., increased funding for new advanced
computers? (2) How significant is your agencies= consultive role
with the Department of Commerce within the current export
restrictions?  Should this role be strengthened or is it even
necessary? How much additional application process time does your
agencies= consultive role add to the Department of Commerce=s
procedures?  (3) It is commonly accepted that current encryption
export restrictions imposed by the Administration will delay the
proliferation of advanced encryption products, but that it is
inevitable that advanced encryption products will be developed
world-wide. In your opinion, do export restrictions prevent the
development and distribution of advanced encryption products? (4)
Are foreign import restrictions consistent with the
Administration=s policy? Please identify the countries that have
import restrictions and those that have stated their intent not to
have any import restrictions. If the United States relaxes its
export restrictions, do you anticipate that foreign nations will
increase their import restrictions?

In addition, we request that your staff analyze and submit their
comments on the following: (1) the current export restrictions;
(2) the congressional bills introduced that would alter export
policy (H.R. 695, S. 376, S. 377); and (3) any other analysis
related to encryption export policy your organization has
prepared.

Please have your staff contact John Morabito or Tricia Paoletta of
the Commerce Committee staff at (202) 225-2927 if you have any
questions regarding the above request. We thank you in advance for
your assistance. With kindest regards, we are

Sincerely,



Tom Bliley

Chairman


Rick White

Member of Congress

Subject: File 4--COMMENTARY: Katz on Kids and the CDA


THE CDA DISASTER NETWORK
March 24, 1997

Amid all the banter and bluster about the Communications Decency Act,
children have been caught in the crossfire. The CDA, though ostensibly
aimed at protecting young'uns from the dangers of online smut, may also
severely curtail their access to valuable information such as AIDS
education materials and many classic works of literature.  But even more
ominously, as a government lawyer admitted before the Supreme Court last
week, the CDA could turn kids into criminals if they discuss issues of
sexuality online with other kids.

As Jon Katz writes in his Netizen column today, "That a high-ranking
government official would consider "unfiltered" access to Penthouse or
Hustler a far greater danger to society than turning healthy, otherwise
law-abiding older kids into criminals for talking about sexuality is as
powerful a commentary as anybody could make about how irrational the
discussion in America has become about new media, technology, morality, and
children."

Jon's piece -- and the unhappy comments about the CDA he's gotten from
Net-savvy kids -- are thought-provoking, so I've included the full text of
his column below.

Work the network!

Media Rant

by Jon Katz
<JDKatz@aol.com>

Youth speak for themselves about the CDA


 Real children are voiceless and invisible even as they are ostensibly at
the center of the raging national debate about ensuring their safety
from media, technology, advertising, and pornography. Even though
champions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 characterize the
Internet as a danger, and a "revolutionary means for displaying patently
offensive, sexually explicit material to children in the privacy of
their homes," no children are ever heard from in discussions about their
safety.

Adults, politicians, and journalists feel free to define kids, delineate
dangers facing them, curb other people's freedom in the name of
protecting them - yet they are eerily absent from discussions about
their welfare. And if you spend any time talking to them, it's clear
why. They aren't afraid of new media, and aren't in danger from it.

In more than six weeks of touring to discuss children, morality, and old
and new media on behalf of my book Virtuous Reality, I never saw or
heard from a single young person on more than 150 radio and television
appearances, almost every one of which talked about kid's cultural lives
and the many "dangers" arising from TV, movies, and the Internet.

In the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in Washington on
Wednesday discussing the constitutionality of the CDA, US Supreme Court
Justice Stephen Breyer elicited a shocking admission from government
lawyers - buried deep in most media reports - that the CDA would
criminalize countless teenagers who speak about their sexual lives, real
or imagined, over email or other Net forums.

Breyer asked Deputy Solicitor General Seth Waxman if the CDA "would
suddenly make large numbers of high school students across the country
guilty of federal crimes."

That might be the case, argued Waxman, who added that the prospect of
turning hundreds of thousands of teens into federal criminals because
they yak about sex was "a small price to pay" to protect children from
unfettered access to Penthouse, Hustler, and other sexually explicit
material.

That a high-ranking government official would consider "unfiltered"
access to Penthouse or Hustler a far greater danger to society than
turning healthy, otherwise law-abiding older kids into criminals for
talking about sexuality is as powerful a commentary as anybody could
make about how irrational the discussion in America has become about new
media, technology, morality, and children.

Given the willingness of politicians and government officials to brand
adolescent sexual discussion as criminal behavior, it seems all the more
outrageous that media and politicians have completely excluded the young
from this discussion. But then, kids won't tell them what they want to
hear. Children are presumed by politicians and journalists to be too
stupid, vulnerable, and powerless to join in discussions involving their
cultural lives and welfare. This is a huge mistake for both politics and
media. An entire generation of kids is growing up seeing politicians and
reporters as both clueless and useless. Both of these institutions seem
to have forgotten that these are future voters and future consumers. But
these kids may have long memories, judging from the email I get.

If the Net is about anything, it's about giving voice and expression to
people who haven't had much, especially in mainstream journalism and
politics.

Writing about the rights of children in the digital age in a Wired magazine
article, about music sanitization at Wal-Mart, kids and
pornography and other issues, I've gotten a lot of email from people
under 18. Some of these kids email me regularly. Some volunteered their
opinions about the CDA this week, and I emailed others asking what they
thought about it.

All the first names and cities are real. So are all the quotes. I
cleaned up some misspellings and edited out some sentences for space.
Otherwise, they are quoted directly from email posts. Not one of the
children I corresponded with felt the Internet was dangerous or felt
there was a need for federal policing of "decency" on the Internet.
Almost all wondered why the government didn't move as aggressively to
tackle the real problems many of them see every day.

Jim from Kansas City, 14, writes: "I don't feel I need protection from
the Internet. Why hasn't anybody asked kids like me? I'd love to go in
front of the Supreme Court and tell them how great the Internet is. My
parents taught me not to give out my name, address, or send anything to
somebody I don't know. They taught me that when I was 10. I've been
approached once by somebody who asked me if I wanted to send him some
pictures for money, and that was in a Usenet group. I said no. It's
obvious that wouldn't be a good idea."

Patricia from San Jose, 16: "They say this law is supposed to protect
me, when it would put me in jail for talking with my camp roommates
about sex? Who are they kidding? They aren't trying to protect me.
They're trying to control my life and keep power for themselves. I'm not
stupid. I can take care of myself. Why don't they take care of people
with real problems?"

Donna, 15, from Philadelphia: "I have rights. I have freedoms, too. Why
are all these old white men telling me what is moral for me?"

Arrow from New York City, 9: "The Internet is a great place. I'm not
scared of it all. Nobody has ever showed me a dirty picture, and I
wouldn't give anybody my address or telephone number, and nobody has
asked. I go into AOL chats, and I've seen dirty words, but I used them
anyway, before I ever went onto a computer. The kids in my school use
them. I don't think that hurts me. Mostly online I email my pen pals
from other countries and go onto movie and TV Web sites and play games.
My life is so cool since the Internet. I do my homework there, too."

Heather from Minneapolis, 14: "Kids in my school form gangs. They carry
guns. Guns are easy to get, but they want to make it a crime to talk
dirty on the Internet? Brother! These kids really hurt each other,
because they don't have parents who will take care of them and watch out
for them. My parents watch out for me. They got me a computer because my
mom didn't want me to have trouble getting into a good school and
getting a good job. She did it because she loves me. She had to work
hard to buy me this computer. If these people in Washington want to help
kids, why don't they train them to find jobs, and take guns off the
streets, and make it a crime to have children when you can't take care
of them. If they try to tell me what to say on a computer, they'll be
surprised, because my friends and I will never let them do that. I can
speak freely on the computer. I can't in school. They should be ashamed
of themselves."

JimmyD from Arkansas, 12: "No wonder everybody hates Washington. They're
incredibly stupid and clueless. Penthouse isn't dangerous for me.
Getting killed by a gun is dangerous to me. Don't they have anything to
do there but to worry about whether I use dirty words? My father yelled
at me and asked me if I ever looked at Playboy online. I asked him if he
ever looked at Playboy when he was my age, and he sent me to my room.
There are a lot of hypocrites in the world. And most of them live in
Washington. That's what the CDA teaches me."

Patricia from Brooklyn, 12: "There are a lot of scary people in the
world, I think. My friend Arquette was shot in the street. But a
computer [her grandmother bought her one] is the safest thing I do. I
love it. I can get dirty pictures anywhere. But online, I have new
friends from everywhere. I can handle some dirty words. Bullets and
knives scare me."

Andreas from New Orleans, 11: "What's with these people, man? I do
homework online. I use my computer to write. I have friends from all
over the world, and I live in a tiny apartment! If I use a dirty word -
OK, I've seen some naked women - is that a crime? Why can't I look at a
picture of a naked woman? I get good grades. I don't hurt anybody. I
don't need protection from the FBI when I go online. My dad told me
never to give out my phone number or the place where I live. I don't.
That ain't hard."

Sandy from Chicago, 13: "My biggest fear? No jobs when I grow up. My
sister has been looking for work for five years. It's hard out there,
she says. The Internet isn't scary. It's fun and interesting. There's
sexual stuff out there, sure. But you don't have to go looking for it,
and you can avoid it. My mom told me if I ever see anything I don't like
or understand, turn the computer off and go get her. That's pretty easy.
Five kids got beat up at the school dance last week. One of them had a
knife. That's scary. I'd take a computer anytime."

According to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, fewer than
30 young people have been harmed as the result of online encounters in
the history of the Internet, which encompasses billions of interactions
involving children every week. Of these, most were adolescents and
teenagers who were drawn into dangerous and unhealthy relationships. In
l995, nearly 5,000 American children were killed by guns, which are
available from Wal-Mart and other fine stores.
