Subject--Possible story--Clinton / pager interception
Date--Fri, 19 Sep 1997 13:28:23 -0700 (PDT)

Hello-- I have a possible news story tip, and I thought you might be
interested.

A hacker today announced the interception of Pres. Clinton's pager
messages (along with pager messages destined for staff, Secret Service
agents, and other members of his entourage) during his recent trip to
Philadelphia.  This is coming as an embarassment to the administration's
policy on communications privacy and encryption.

The lengthy transcript of pager messagers was published on the Internet
today to demonstrate that the pager infrastructure is highly insecure.

(Apparently the Pres.'s entourage relies a lot on pagers for
communications.  There are messages from Hilary and Chelsea; a
Secret Service scare; late-breaking basketball scores for the
Pres.; staffers exchanging romantic notes; and other amusements.)

This comes at quite an embarassing time for the administration,
given their policy on encryption.  Strong encryption is the one
technology that could have protected Pres. Clinton's private pager
messages, but the administration has been fighting against strong
encryption.  Top FBI officials have been giving many classified
briefings to House members, asking them to ban all strong
encryption in the US.  These proposals are expected to reach the
House floor soon, attached to the (originally pro-encryption) SAFE
bill.

An anonymous White House staffer was quoted as saying that it
would be &quot;an expensive and complicated proposition&quot; to put
encryption into pagers and cellphones.  This quote is interesting,
because it's the White House's crypto policies that have made it
so complicated and expensive to add strong encryption -- the
cellphone and pager industries have wanted to add strong
encryption for privacy and security, but the administration has
forcefully dissuaded them from doing so.

Anyhow, the press release is at

        <a href="http://www.inch.com/~esoteric/pam_suggestion/formal.html">http://www.inch.com/~esoteric/pam_suggestion/formal.html</a>

The transcript of the pager messages (complete with basketball
scores for the Pres, messages to call wifey, two phone calls from
Chelsea --who got put on hold, staff romances, a Secret Service
scare, etc.) is at

From: &quot;ACLU Cyber-Liberties Update Owner&quot;@newmedium.com
Subject: File 2--Anti-Spam Bills in Congress

Source - ACLU Cyber-Liberties Update, Tuesday, September 2, 1997

Unsolicited e-mail advertisement, or &quot;spam,&quot; has few fans on the
net. Court battles have been waged between service providers, such
as AOL and Compuserve, and spam advertisers, including Cyber
Promotions, over whether the thousands of  messages sent to user
e-mails can be blocked. Congress and several state legislatures
have also stepped into the debate and have introduced some bills
fraught with First Amendment problems because they ban commercial
speech altogether or are content specific.

Traditionally, commercial speech restrictions on telemarketing
calls and unsolicited fax advertisements have passed First
Amendment challenges but direct mail and door-to-door
solicitations enjoy much greater protection.  Given the Supreme
Court decision in ACLU v. Reno, on-line messages should receive
the same First Amendment protection given traditional print media,
which includes commercial mailings.  Thus, while netizens may laud
efforts to curb spam, it is unclear whether some of the
unsolicited commercial e-mail bills can pass constitutional
muster.

Even more troubling are the state spam bills which create
different rules for each state that advertisers will have to
follow.  Under some state bills, if a spam message is sent or made
available to a resident in one state, it could confer jurisdiction
over the sender and could subject them to liability if they are in
violation of local law.  A federal judge recently ruled that state
control or regulation of Internet communications violates the
Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In the decision in ALA v.
Pataki, which involved a challenge by the ACLU to a New York
Internet decency law, federal district Judge Loretta Preska
declared that states are prohibited from regulating an interstate
communication which merely passes through their borders. Judge
Preska warned of the extreme danger that state regulation would
pose to the Internet, rejecting the state's argument that the
statute would even be effective in preventing so-called
&quot;indecency&quot; from reaching minors.  Hence, state spam bills will
probably not withstand constitutional challenges.The decision in
ALA v. Pataki is available at
&lt;<a href="http://www.aclu.org/court/nycdadec.html">http://www.aclu.org/court/nycdadec.html</a>&gt;

Below is a synopsis of the federal bills and the first state
enacted law on spam from Nevada.  The ACLU objected to an earlier,
even broader version of the Nevada law before its enactment and is
considering participating in a challenge to the law.  The Nevada
law, as enacted contains broad definitions of e-mail that may
include advertisements on web sites and other on-line forums. Full
text of the federal bills is available at
&lt;<a href="http://www.jmls.edu/cyber/statutes/email/">http://www.jmls.edu/cyber/statutes/email/</a>&gt;

Netizens Protection Act of 1997, Introduced May 22,1997 (H.R.
1748):

Sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) would amend the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act of 1991, (&quot;TCPA&quot;) which regulates
telemarketing and junk-faxes to include unsolicited e-mail
advertisements.  The bill would ban unsolicited e-mail and only
permit the sending of commercial messages where there is a
pre-existing relationship between the sender and recipient, or
when the recipient has requested the information.  The bill
provides for hefty penalties for violations.

Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Choice Act of 1997, (S.
771):

Sponsored by Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-AL) the bill would require
senders to label content of a commercial e-mail message as an
&quot;advertisement&quot; and to honor recipient &quot;opt-out&quot; requests within
48 hours, and put the burden of blocking spam on ISPs.  Failure by
ISPs to filter out messages would result in liability and steep
penalties for providers, not spammers.

Electronic Mailbox Protection Act of 1997, introduced June 11,1997
(S.875):

Sponsored by Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) the bill would restrict
the use of false e-mail addresses or domain names to avoid
filtering by commercial advertisers.  Spammers would also be
required to honor recipient &quot;opt-out&quot; requests,  and violators
would be hit with civil penalties up to $5,000.

Data Privacy Act of 1997, introduced July 31, 1997 (H.R. 2368):

Sponsored by Rep. Tauzin the bill would create an industry working
group to draft voluntary guidelines with incentives for
advertisers who adopt them to: limit the collection and use, for
commercial marketing purposes, of personally identifiable
information obtained from individuals through any interactive
computer service; require unsolicited e-mail advertisers to
identify the sender, including a valid reply address; disclose
when such information is gathered; provide a consumer opt-out
provision; limit the display of social security numbers and
prohibit the commercial marketing and use of medical information.

Nevada Anti-Spam Law:  Senate Bill 13 , enacted July 8, 1997 and
goes into effect on July 1, 1998:

Under the law, transmitting commercial advertisements in the form
of e-mail may subject the sender to civil fines and provides that
a recipient may enjoin the sender from such future conduct and may
receive restitution.  The law defines an advertisement as material
that advertises for commercial purposes the availability or the
quality of real property, goods or services; or  is designed or
intended to solicit a person to purchase real property, goods or
services.  The law also imposes liability upon Internet Service
Providers since it applies to any party that causes to be
transmitted commercial mail.

The exception to the law permits sending commercial e-mail where:
(a) The person has a preexisting business or personal relationship
with the recipient; (b) The recipient has expressly consented to
receive the item or (c) The advertisement is readily identifiable
as promotional, or contains a statement providing that it is an
advertisement, and clearly and conspicuously provides:  (1) The
legal name, complete street address and electronic mail address of
the person transmitting the electronic mail; and (2) A notice that
the recipient may decline to receive additional electronic mail
that includes an advertisement from the person transmitting the
electronic mail and the procedures for declining such electronic
mail.

Pat,

In today's {Detroit Free Press} there was an article about an ISP,
RustNet, based in Livonia, MI. who has filed suit in US. District
Court.

US District Court Judge Paul Borman issued a restraining order against
brothers, Benjamin &amp; Randell Bawkon, owners of Bawkon Development
Company, forbidding them from engaging in any spamming. Their computer
records were sized by federal Marshals last Friday.

RustNet President Steve Corso claims in his suit that the brothers
sent out hundreds of thousands of e-mails in August falsely using
RustNet's return address. According to the article, RustNet has been
getting thousands of complaints and has even lost customers to these
spams.

I hope he takes them to the cleaners. I hope the case goes to court
and RustNet gets their homes and cars and anything else they may have
a value. Hell, maybe the brothers can start a tag team in prison.


Chip Cryderman

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: That's great! It really is good news
in the fight against the insects and rodents who have infested the
net over the past couple years. I hope if they have a victory in
court it will serve as encouragement for other ISP's to use the
same tactics.  PAT]

   Cyber Promotions tossed offline
   By Janet Kornblum
   September 19, 1997, 1:25 p.m. PT

   Cyber Promotions, antispammers' enemy No. 1 on the Net, has once again
   been dumped by its access provider.

   Backbone provider AGIS cut off Cyber Promotions Wednesday, and the
   company has been scrambling for another ISP since.

   It was unclear exactly why Cyber Promotions was cut off, but an
   employee who answered the phone at AGIS's main switchboard declined to
   comment beyond the following: &quot;They were in violation of security, and
   that's as far as I can go with it.&quot; No one else at AGIS would comment,
   either, the employee added.

  .................

   Wallace said today that Cyber Promotions found itself cut off from
   AGIS Wednesday and that it took two days to find other providers where
   the company could mount portions of its service. But some of its
   clients are still without service, he added.

  ....................

   &quot;Ping-flood attacks observed originating from the West Coast into AGIS
   and directed to the Washington and Philadelphia routers severely
   degraded AGIS network performance to [an] unacceptable level...AGIS
   had no alternative but to shut off services to Cyber Promotions,&quot;
   reads a statement that Wallace put on his page. He alleged that the
   statement came from an AGIS engineer.

Subject: File 5--ALERT: Call Congress on 9/22 to Stop Big Brother!!

           Please forward where appropriate until September 28, 1997

                        This alert brought to you by
The Voters Telecommunications Watch, The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology,
              the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Wired Magazine,
                        and Americans for Tax Reform
STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM BUILDING BIG BROTHER INTO THE INTERNET

In 1948, George Orwell described a future world in which Big Brother
peaked over the shoulder of every citizen -- watching every move and
listening to every word.

Now, in 1997, the FBI is pushing the United States Congress to pass
legislation which would make George Orwell's frightening vision a reality.

Next week the House Commerce Committee will meet to consider a
proposal that would require all Americans to provide the government
guaranteed access to their private online communications and business
transactions.  Taking a page out of Orwell's 1984, the FBI-spawned
proposal would require that every part of the Internet -- from the
software on your computer to the network provider that carries your
messages around the net -- be jury-rigged to divulge your private
conversations immediately on request by the FBI (see below).

Unfortunately, this is not a work of fiction.

The amendment, to be offered by Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and
Thomas Manton (D-NY), is a serious threat to your privacy and represents
the first and final step in the construction of a National Surveillance
Infrastructure.

A vote is expected on September 25.  The future of privacy and security
in the information age is in the hands of the Commerce Committee, and
they need to know that folks are watching and care about the outcome.

On Monday September 22, please join thousands of Internet users all across
the country as we call on Congress to stop big brother.  With your help and
support,  we can ensure that George Orwell's 1984 does not become a reality.

All the information you need is attached below.

  _____________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 22, pick up the phone and call as many of the four
   leading members of the Commerce committee as you can:

     Chairman Thomas Bliley (R-VA)         (202) 225-2815
     Ranking member John Dingell (D-MI)    (202) 225-4071
     Rep. Tauzin (R-LA)                    (202) 225-4031
     Rep. Markey (D-MA)                    (202) 225-2836

2. Ask for the staffer that handles the encryption issue.

3. Say that you're calling to urge the Congressman to pass SAFE (HR695)
   without amendments.

   Specifically, say that you &quot;OPPOSE THE OXLEY/MANTON BIG BROTHER AMENDMENT.
   Americans should not be required to give the government keys to the front
   door of their house, and they shouldn't be required to give the government
   the keys to unlock their private online communications.&quot;

Other amendments may be proposed.  Please urge the Congressman to pass SAFE
&quot;as is&quot; and oppose any amendments. Feel free to use your own words though
here are some points you might want to stress:

- Oxley/Manton is a dramatic expansion of law enforcement power.  It would
   give law enforcement &quot;immediate&quot; access to private online communications
   and business transactions without any notice or knowledge to the user.

- Oxley/Manton is NOT A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY INTERESTS AND LAW
   ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS, as some supporters have argued.  It gives the FBI
   broad new power while stripping Americans of their Fourth Amendment right
   to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.

- Oxley/Manton would give the Attorney General authority to dictate the
   design of Internet services and software to suit the needs of law
   enforcement.

- Oxley/Manton would not stop crime. Strong encryption without &quot;immediate
   access&quot; features is available today at home and abroad.

- Oxley/Manton would increase opportunities for cybercrime as criminal hackers
   attack vulnerabilities in the key recovery access system.

4. Let us know how it went!  Go to one of the following web pages, depending
   on who you called, and tell us about the conversation.

   Rep. Bliley     <a href="http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=va07">http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=va07</a>
   Rep. Dingell    <a href="http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=mi16">http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=mi16</a>
   Rep. Tauzin     <a href="http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=la03">http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=la03</a>
   Rep. Markey     <a href="http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=ma07">http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=ma07</a>

5. Forward this ALERT to your friends and colleagues.

6. Feel good about yourself!  Know that you've stood up for privacy, and
   contacting Congress is more than most people take the time to do!

BACKGROUND

The House Commerce Committee is considering a bill known as the &quot;Security and
Freedom through Encryption Act&quot; (HR 695, a.k.a. SAFE).  SAFE would
encourage the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use encryption
technologies in order to protect privacy and promote electronic commerce on
the Internet.  SAFE enjoys broad support from Internet users, civil
liberties advocates, and over 250 members of Congress.

Last week, the Commerce Committee delayed its vote on the SAFE bill in
order to give the Committee more time to study the implications of the
Oxley/Manton amendment, which would change SAFE to ban encryption which
does not contain features that provide law enforcement with &quot;immediate
access&quot; to the plain text of encrypted information, including private
communications and business transactions (visit
<a href="http://www.crypto.com/safe_bill/">http://www.crypto.com/safe_bill/</a>)

The Oxley/Manton amendment would for the first time impose sweeping
restrictions on the ability of American citizens to protect their privacy
on US soil. Specifically, the amendment would:

* PROHIBIT THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS OR
  SERVICES WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE INSTANT ACCESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT: The
  proposal would prohibit the manufacture, sale, import, or distribution
  within the United States of any encryption product unless it allows
  &quot;immediate access&quot; to the plain text of any user's messages or files
  without the user's knowledge.

* GRANT BROAD NEW AUTHORITY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SET TECHNICAL
  STANDARDS FOR ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS: The proposal allows the Attorney
  General to set standards for what are and are not acceptable
  encryption products. The proposal's requirement of immediate access to
  plain text would seem to seriously limit the options available to
  encryption manufacturers seeking approval of their products.

The amendment does not specify whether the immediate access &quot;features&quot;
could be activated (or not) at the option of the purchaser or end user.
Nonetheless,  requiring that such a capability be installed in all domestic
communications networks and encryption products is the equivalent of
enabling a national surveillance infrastructure and asserts unprecedented
control over the design of Internet software, hardware, and services.

The amendment is analogous to the government requiring surveillance cameras
in every new house built in the United States, which could be turned on
remotely by the police if you were ever suspected of committing a crime.

Worse yet, such &quot;key escrow&quot; or &quot;key recovery&quot; technologies pose
significant risk to the security of the Internet -- providing new
points of vulnerability for hackers, terrorists, and industrial spies
to exploit.  A recent study by 11 of the worlds leading cryptographers
concluded that the large scale deployment of such technologies would be
too complex and too insecure to meet the needs of an Information Age
society (see <a href="http://www.crypto.com/key_study/">http://www.crypto.com/key_study/</a>)

Despite widespread opposition from Internet users, civil liberties
groups, privacy advocates, and the computer and communications
industries, Oxley and Manton plan to push for this FBI spawned amendment
at the Commerce Committee vote.  If it is adopted, it would
represent the first and final step in the development of a national
surveillance infrastructure.

An action alert is a message that someone sends out to the net
asking for a specific action to be taken on a current political
issue.  Well-designed action alerts are a powerful way to invite
people to participate in the processes of a democracy.  Having
seen many action alerts in my twenty years on the Internet, I have
tried to abstract some guidelines for people who wish to use them.
Even if you do not plan to construct any action alerts yourself, I
do not recommend that you forward anybody else's alerts unless
they conform to at least the spirit of these guidelines.  If I
sometimes seem stern or didactic in my prescriptions, please
forgive me.  It's just that I've seen badly designed action alerts
do an awful lot of damage.

Although an Internet action alert should always be part of an
issue campaign with a coherent strategy and clear goals, I won't
discuss the larger strategic questions here.  Instead, I will
simply divide action alerts into two categories, single messages
and structured campaigns.  Single alerts are broadcast in the hope
that they will propagate to the maximum possible number of
sympathetic Internet users.  Structured campaigns are typically
conducted through mailing lists specially constructed for the
purpose, and their intended audience may include either the whole
Internet universe or a narrower group of already-mobilized
partisans.

Both types of action alerts are obviously modeled on things that
have been happening on paper, through telephone trees, and lately
via fax machines, for a long time.  What computer networks do is
make them a lot cheaper.  A networked alert can travel far from
its origin by being forwarded from friend to friend and list to
list, without any additional cost being imposed on the original
sender.  This phenomenon of chain-forwarding is important, and it
behooves the would-be author of an action alert, whether a single
message or a whole campaign, to think through its consequences:

(1) Establish authenticity.  Bogus action alerts -- such as the
notorious &quot;modem tax&quot; alert -- travel just as fast as real
