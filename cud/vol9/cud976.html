CLASS ACTION AND HEARING THEREON




TO: ALL AMERICA ONLINE SUBSCRIBERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED
STATES WHO WERE SUBSCRIBERS TO AMERICA ONLINE ON
DECEMBER 1, 1996 OR WHO BECAME SUBSCRIBERS ON SAID
DATE OR THEREAFTER



IMPORTANT



PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THIS NOTICE RELATES TO THE
PROPOSED SETTLEM ENT OF THIS CLASS ACTION, THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS
HEARING AND YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO
SHARE IN THE BENEFITS OF THE SETTLEMEN T, TO EXCLUDE YOURSELF FROM THE
CLASS OR TO OBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT.

Pursuant to an Order of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery
Division (&quot;t he Court&quot;) dated May 1, 1997, YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED:



I.

DEFINITION OF THE CLASS AND PRIOR NOTICE




By Orders dated January 30, 1997, and January 31, 1997, the Court
certified thi s action (the &quot;Action&quot;) as a class action on behalf of a
nationwide class (the &quot;Class&quot;) consisting of:

All AOL subscribers throughout the United States who were subscribers
to AOL on December 1, 1996 or who became subscribers on said date or
thereafter.

If you are or were a subscriber to America Online, Inc. (&quot;AOL&quot;) at any
time fro m December 1, 1996 to the present, you are a member of the
Class.  Your rights to participate in the settlement, object to the
settlement, or exclude yourself from the Class are described in this
Notice.

Pursuant to prior Orders of the Court, the Class was provided notice
dated Febr uary 25, 1997 of: the pendency of this Action; a
description of the claims asse rted in the Action; the Assurance of
Voluntary Compliance (&quot;Assurance&quot;) reached between AOL and 45 state
Attorneys General; and your right as a Class member t o remain in the
Class or exclude yourself from the Class (the &quot;Notice of Penden cy&quot;).

This Notice is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, an
expression of any opinion by the Court with respect to the truth of
the allegations in t he Action or the merits of the claims or defenses
asserted.  This Notice is sen t to advise you of the proposed
settlement of this Action and of your rights wi th respect to this
Action and the proposed settlement.



II.

THE ACTION



The Action was commenced on December 18, 1996, when Plaintiff Steven
F. Schwab (the &quot;Class Representative&quot;) filed a class action complaint
(&quot;Complaint&quot;).  The Complaint alleges that AOL, which owns and
operates the computer online servic e &quot;America Online,&quot; breached its
subscription agreements with its customers, an d violated state
consumer protection and deceptive trade practice laws, by falsely
advertising and agreeing to provide unlimited access to AOL'S online
servic e for a flat rate.

The Complaint alleges that in late 1996 AOL promised existing and
prospective c ustomers &quot;unlimited access&quot; to America Online for a
fixed rate of $19.95 a mont h (or less for one and two year prepaid
subscriptions).  It is alleged that AOL offered and advertised its
&quot;unlimited access&quot; plan with knowledge that (1) sub scribers would
spend considerably more time online, (2) AOL's number of subscri bers
would increase dramatically, and (3) AOL did not have the capacity
necessa ry to meet the increased demand for online time.

As a result, it is alleged that Class members have experienced long
delays in c onnecting to America Online, have been unable to connect
to America Online, and , once connected, have been disconnected.  The
Complaint alleges that, as a res ult, AOL has failed to deliver the
unlimited online access it promised.

AOL denies that it has breached any agreement or otherwise violated
any state o r federal law in connection with the foregoing and denies
that any Class member is entitled to recover any damages.



III.

THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS HEARING



The Class Representative and Class Counsel have reached a proposed
settlement w ith AOL (the &quot;Settlement&quot;).  The terms of the Settlement
are set forth in detai l in the parties' Memorandum of Understanding
(&quot;MOU&quot;), which has been filed wit h the Court and is available to the
public to review during regular business ho urs at the office of the
Clerk of the Circuit Court, Richard J. Daley Building, Room 802, 50 W.
Washington, Chicago, Illinois, 60602.  The Court has prelimina rily
approved the Settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate and has
directed that this Notice be provided to Class members.

The Court has rescheduled the hearing before the Honorable Stephen A.
Schiller from October 8, 1997 to November 20, 1997 at 2:00 p.m. at the
Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Richard J. Daley Center,
Courtroom 2402, 50 W. Washingto n Street, Chicago, Illinois, to
consider whether the Settlement should be final ly approved as fair,
reasonable and adequate, to hear all objections to the Set tlement,
and to consider Class Counsel's request for attorneys fees and reimbur
sement of costs (the &quot;Settlement Fairness Hearing&quot;).

Class members who do not request exclusion (as described in paragraph
VI(B) bel ow) have the right to participate, either in person or
through counsel retained by them, in the Settlement Fairness Hearing.
Attendance at the Settlement Fai rness Hearing is not necessary;
however, persons who wish to comment orally on the proposed Settlement
must state in writing their intention to appear at the Settlement
Fairness Hearing and the nature of their proposed comment, and must
serve that document in the time and manner prescribed for written
objections in paragraph VI(C) below.

The Court may continue or adjourn the Settlement Fairness Hearing
without further notice to the Class.

     E.   Release of Claims Against AOL

AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE RELEASE TO BE GIVEN TO AOL IN THE SETTLEMENT
WILL RELE ASE CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW WHICH YOU MAY HAVE
AGAINST AOL. YOU SHO ULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WISH TO REMAIN
A MEMBER OF THE CLASS AND SH ARE IN THE SETTLEMENT, OR WHETHER YOU
SHOULD EXCLUDE YOURSELF FROM THE CLASS U NDER SECTION VI(B) BELOW.

Upon Court approval of the Settlement becoming final, the Class
members and the ir respective agents, successors, heirs, or assigns
shall be deemed to have, an d by operation of the Final Judgment and
Order of Dismissal (&quot;Final Judgment&quot;) in the Schwab Action, shall have
fully, finally, and forever released, relinqui shed and discharged all
Released Claims against the Released Parties. &quot;Released Claims&quot; means
any and all claims, rights (including rights to reimbursement, r
estitution, or damages), demands, actions, causes of actions, suits,
matters, i ssues, debts, liens, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages
or losses of any nat ure, whether under Federal laws or regulations or
the laws, common law or regul ations of any State or subdivision,
arising from a Class Member's difficulty in accessing or using,
difficulty in attemtping to access or use, and/or inabilit y to access
or use AOL's online service from December 1, 1996 through and inclu
ding November 15, 1997, because of the AOL system's alleged inability
to handle the demand for AOL's online service. Released Claims shall
not include claims arising from an AOL subscriber allegedly not
knowing the cost of the telephone connection that the subscriber was
incurring in accessing and using the AOL ser vice or that there would
be a cost for the telephone connection. &quot;Released Part ies&quot; means AOL

mployees and their predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants, and advisors.

Other actions, including other class actions, have been brought by
other plaint iffs alleging claims on behalf of subscribers of AOL. To
the extent that such o ther plaintiffs are members of the Class
defined herein, and such persons do no t validly exclude themselves
from the Class, the Settlement and the release to be given under the
Settlement will preclude those persons from continuing to pu rsue
those other actions against AOL and the Released Parties.

F.  Attorneys' Fees and Expenses

More than 50 counsel in 40 lawsuits coordinated their efforts to

Settlement, AOL has ag reed to pay attorneys fees to counsel for the
Class and to reimburse the out-o f-pocket costs to counsel for the
Class, each in the amount approved by the Co urt.  Counsel for the
Class have agreed to limit their request for attorneys f ees and costs
to a total of three million dollars.  The payment of fees and co sts
by AOL is in addition to the refunds and credits to be paid to the
Class a nd will not affect such payments.  Counsel for the Class have
prosecuted this Action on a contingent basis and have not received any
payment of fees, or any reimbursement of their out-of-pocket costs.

Subject: File 2--Hoaxer (and a poor one) targets AOL

The following email appeared in my inbox yesterday. According to AOL, it's a
hoax. CU digest readers may be interested in being alerted about it.

John Mello
Woonsocket, RI

  +++++++++++++=

From a former AOL employee:

I'll try and cut through the crap, and try to get to the point of
this letter.  I used to work for America Online, and would like
to remain anonymous for that reason.  I was laid off in early
September, but I know exactly why I was laid off, which I will
now explain:

Since last December, I had been one of the many people assigned
to design AOL 4.0 for Windows  (AOL 4.0 beta, codenamed
Casablanca).  In the beginning, I was very proud of this task,
until I found out the true cost of it.  Things were going fine
until about mid-February, when me and 2 of my colleagues started
to suspect a problem, an unexplainable 'Privacy Invasion', with
the new version.  One of them, who is a master programmer, copied
the finished portion of the new version (Then 'Build 52'), and
took it home, and we spent nearly 2 weeks of sleepless nights
examining and debugging the program, flipping it inside-out, and
here is what we found.

Unlike all previous versions of America Online, version 4.0 puts
something in your hard drive called a 'cookie'.  (AOL members
click here for  a  definition).  However, the cookie we found on
Version 4.0 was far more treacherous than the simple internet
cookie.  How would
 you like somebody looking at your entire hard drive, snooping
through any (yes, any) piece of information on your hard drive.
It could also read your password and log in information and store
it deep in the program code.  Well, all previous versions,
whether you like it or not, have done this to a certain extent,
but only with files you downloaded.  As me and my colleagues
discovered, with the new version, anytime you are signed on to
AOL, any top aol executive, any aol worker, who has been sworn to
secrecy regarding this feature, can go into your hard drive and
retrieve any piece of information that they so desire.  Billing,
download records, e-mail, directories, personal documents,
programs, financial information, scanned images, etc ... Better
start keeping all those pictures on a floppy disk!

This is a totally disgusting violation of our rights, and your
right to know as well.  Since this is undoubtably 'Top Secret'
information that I am revealing, my life at AOL is pretty much
over.  After discovering this information, we started to inform a
few other workers at America Online, so that we could get a large
enough crew to stop this from happening to the millions of
unfortunate and unsuspecting America Online members.  This was in
early August.  One month later, all three of us were unemployed.
We got together, and figured there was something we had to do to
let the public know.

Unemployed, with one of us going through a divorce (me) and
another who is about to undergo treatment for Cancer, our
combined financial situation is not currently enough to release
any sort or article.  We attepted to create a web page on three
different servers containing in-depth information on AOL 4.0, but
all three were taken down within 2 days.  We were running very
low on time (4.0 is released early this winter), so we figured
our last hope to reveal this madness before it effects the people
was starting something similar to a chain letter, this letter you
are reading.  Please do the following, to help us expose AOL for
who they really are, and to help us and yourself recieve personal
gratification for taking a stand for our freedom:

1.  Forward this letter to as many people as you can (not just
friends and family, as many as you can!)

2.  Tell people who aren't on America Online in person,
especially important people (Private Investigators, Government
workers, City Council)

3.  If the information about the new version isn't exposed by the
time aol is released early this winter, for your own protection,
DON'T DOWNLOAD AOL 4.0 UNDER ANY CONDITION !!!

Thank you for reading and examining this information.  Me and my
colleagues hope that you will help us do the right thing in this
situation.  Enjoy America Online (just kidding!).

Regards,
A former AOL employee

Subject: File 3--AOL Says E-Mail Scare is a Hoax

AOL SAYS E-MAIL SCARE IS A HOAX

   America Online's rollout of new channels Monday was marred
somewhat by an electronic mail hoax claiming that the nation's
leading on-line service will use a new generation of its software
to spy on customers.

   AOL denied the e-mail letter has any validity and said it has
reported the document to the federal Department of Energy, which,
in turn, has listed it on a Web site devoted to news of Internet
viruses and hoaxes.

   The e-mail purports to be from a former AOL employee who said
that he and other former employees discovered that AOL's new
software, dubbed AOL 4.0, contains code that enables the company
to go into the hard drive of a customer's computer and retrieve
any information stored there.

   The company said this is false.

   &quot;We don't scan or search or track any information on any
member's hard drive,&quot; said Tricia Primrose, an AOL spokeswoman.
&quot;We have a real commitment to our subscribers and protecting their
privacy.&quot;

&lt;snip&gt;

((The article notes that the concern is over the &quot;cookies&quot; that
gather information about and from users' Net travels. It adds that
AOL's software won't be available to customers until later this
year))
