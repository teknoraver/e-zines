CALL FOR PAPERS

The Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security

Where: San Diego, California
When: March 1998

GOAL: The symposium will foster information exchange between hardware and
software developers of network and distributed system security services.
The intended audience is those who are interested in the practical aspects
of network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system
design and implementation, rather than theory.  Encouraging and enabling
the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available
security technology is the major focus of symposium.  Symposium proceedings
will be published by the Internet Society.  Topics for the symposium
include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Architectures for large-scale, heterogeneous distributed systems
* Security in malleable systems: mobile code, mobile agents, dynamic policy
  updates, etc.
* Special problems: e.g. interplay between security goals and other goals --
  efficiency, reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and cost.
* Integrating security services with system and application security
  facilities and with application protocols, including message handling,
  file transport, remote file access,  directories, time synchronization,
  data base management, routing, voice and video multicast, network
  management, boot services, and mobile computing.
* Fundamental services:  authentication, integrity, confidentiality,
  authorization, non-repudiation, and availability.
* Supporting mechanisms and APIs: key management and certification
  infrastructures, audit, and intrusion detection.
* Telecommunications security, especially for emerging technologies -- very
  large systems like the Internet, high-speed systems like the gigabit
  testbeds, wireless systems, and personal communication systems.
* Controls: firewalls, packet filters, application gateways
* Object security and security objects
* Network information resources and tools such as World Wide Web (WWW),
  Gopher, Archie, and WAIS.
* Electronic commerce:  payment services, fee-for-access, EDI, notary;
  endorsement, licensing, bonding, and other forms of assurance; intellectual
  property protections

Subject: File 3--Upcoming Computer Policy and Law Program

*************************************************************
CORNELL UNIVERSITY
COMPUTER POLICY AND LAW
July 9-11, 1997
Ithaca, New York
*************************************************************

An Invitation
   -------------
To Technology Administrators, Legal Counsel, Judicial Administrators,
Risk Managers, Auditors, Librarians, and Affirmative Action Officers at
Colleges and Universities.

In order to design appropriate computer-use policies and to plan for
their effective implementation, colleges and universities must develop
a new level of collaboration between technology specialists and the
institution's legal counsel.  At COMPUTER POLICY AND LAW, participants
will examine the legal implications of extensive campus networking and
explore frameworks for limiting personal and institutional exposure to
liability, while at the same time preserving free speech and academic
freedom.

All too often computer-use policies are developed in response to crises
resulting from the misuse of computer and networking resources.  The
Computer Policy and Law program will provide a much-needed opportunity
to take stock of our institutional policies in an atmosphere of frank
evaluation and informed discussion.  PLEASE JOIN US as we identify the
hallmarks of best practice in this area and develop the policy
frameworks that will serve all of us in the critical days ahead.


PROGRAM SESSIONS:

Communication Technologies in Higher Education
   ----------------------------------------------
We'll go on-line to explore the remarkable resources available to the
faculty, staff, and students of an Information Age institution and to
discover how electronic communications are used for scholarship and
instruction, registration and record-keeping, study and research.  As
we review the state of the art of electronic communications
technologies, we will identify the legal issues raised by the use of
e-mail, listservs, discussion groups, the World-Wide Web, and desktop
videoconferencing systems, such as Cornell's CU-SeeMe.

Copyright in Cyberspace
   -----------------------
Electronic communication technologies have dramatically increased the
ease with which words and images can be copied, altered, and
disseminated.  On-line instructional materials, for example, often
present text and graphics adapted from other sources.  While copyright
infringement is widespread on the Internet, it is not legal.  Current
case law and legislation provide mixed signals about an institution's
responsibility to curb copyright infringement on its computer
networks.  This session will review how institutional copyright
policies can navigate such uncertainty and provide accurate information
about the application of copyright laws and permissions policies in
cyberspace.  It will also cover trademark law, including  strategies
for protecting institutional logos and domain names.  An entire session
is devoted to the future of copyright law and policy.

Public Key Infrastructure
   -------------------------
Public-key encryption provides the technological base for secure
e-mail, digitally "signed" transactions, and reliable authentication.
For higher education, this technology will present new opportunites for
conducting business electronically, both with outside organizations and
between internal departments.  Interactions among all members of the
university community will likely be impacted.  This session will
examine the emerging public-key infrastructure in the context of
existing and anticipated legislation and case law.

Electronic Communications: Institutional and Individual Liability
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
This presentation will provide an overview of laws relating to libel,
pornography, obscenity, indecency, and  "negligent publication"
(including the Telecommunications Act of 1996), as they pertain to
colleges and universities in their roles as on-line information
distributors.  It will focus on the new theories of law used in recent
litigation over on-line incidents, including CyberPromotions v. AOL.
We will outline a number of steps that network administrators can take
to minimize institutional and individual liability when responding to
complaints about illegal or offensive materials.

On-Line Privacy
   ---------------
The institution may own the computers and the networks, but who owns
the information on them?  What on-line privacy rights do computer users
have, and does the answer vary by an individual's status as a student,
faculty member, or staff member?  Formulating answers that will provide
a basis for policy making, we will look at the details of open records
laws, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and discovery issues
surrounding records retention policies.

Policy Panel
   ------------
College and university administrators are called upon with increasing
frequency to respond to complaints about misuse of computer resources,
many involving such emotionally charged issues as harassment and
discrimination.  In this panel presentation, representatives of a
variety of institutions will describe the policies they relied on -- or
later implemented -- to deal with a number of highly publicized
computer-abuse cases.  Panelists will address how well these
institutional policies served those affected by the conflict and what
steps they would take in resolving similar problems today.  Particular
attention will be given to the ways institutional goals and
administrative structures should influence policy design and
implementation.

Computer Crime and the Law
   --------------------------
This session will provide an update on recent initiatives of the US
Department of Justice Computer Crime Unit, including current
perspectives on the ECPA.  Topics will include the scope of the
computer crime problem, changes in legislation, sentencing guidelines,
and efforts on domestic and international fronts to reduce
computer-related crimes.

Designing Computer-Use Policies You Can Live With
   -------------------------------------------------
Pulling it all together, this session will provide a framework for
policy making on your campus.  Highlighting the advantages and
disadvantages of existing policies, we will address ways to decrease
legal and public relations liability, to use educational programs to
inform campus communities about their rights and responsibilities in
cyberspace, and to draw on model policies to meet the needs and goals
of individual institutions.

The Cornell Legal Information Institute Post-Program Open House
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
The Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School (LII) was
established in July, 1992 to explore new ways of distributing legal
documents and commentary in electronic form.  The LII will host an Open
House at the Cornell Law School on Friday, 11 July, 1997, from 2:00 to
3:30 p.m.  The founding (and current) directors of the LII, Thomas R.
Bruce and Peter W. Martin, the Jane M.G. Foster Professor of Law at
Cornell, will be present to answer questions about the development,
operation, and future initiatives of the Institute.  All participants
in the Computer Policy and Law Program are invited to attend.

    Sequel Technology Presents Net Access Manager Internet Monitoring and
                Reporting Software at CSI's NetSec Conference

    Sequel's Cornerstone Product Enhances Network Security and Complements
                             Firewall Technology

    SAN FRANCISCO, June 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Sequel Technology, leading
developer of the Sequel Net Access Manager(TM) Internet and intranet
monitoring and reporting tool, announced today at the Computer Security
Institute (CSI) NetSec conference, its plan to enhance network security by
offering a tool that measures employee usage of the Internet and manages
access privileges at the individual, departmental or enterprise level.
    "Many businesses, today, think of firewalls as a vaccine for Internet
security," said Richard Villars, Director of Network Architectures and
Management at IDC Research.  "Once a firewall is installed, they believe that
they're immune to all future security problems.  Unfortunately, many companies
quickly discovered that this sense of security is an illusion.  Organizations
need to develop Internet usage polices for their internal users and
reinforcing these guidelines with software that manages the flow of traffic
both into and out of the network."

    How Net Access Manager Adds Value to a Firewall
    Sequel Net Access Manager provides IS managers with a customizable toolset
for reporting and managing connections from the network to the Internet.  Like
a firewall, it provides the highest degree of security by running from the
server and working as a dual-homed gateway to accurately monitor all TCP/IP
activity between network users and the Internet.
    Sequel Net Access Manager is Internet management software that is designed
to monitor access from the inside (network users) to the outside (the
Internet).  Conversely, a firewall works by blocking outside intruders from
entering into the network.  Together, these two technologies offer a
comprehensive security solution.

    Sequel Provides Sophisticated E-mail Security
    Sequel Technology will soon be joining forces with two leading security
software vendors -- Integralis and SRA International -- to offer a fully
integrated high-end surveillance solution to supervise, track and log all
e-mail communications.  Key components of the system include e-mail content
management software from Integralis which opens and screens the subject,
message body and all attachments for viruses or offensive language.  An even
more intensive screening process developed by SRA uses sophisticated natural
language analysis to detect even the most subtle language patterns, such as
"guaranteed money maker" and "hot little tech stock."  After the messages have
been cleared and delivered to the end user, the Sequel component logs all
traffic and generates various types of activity reports.  The three partners
will be launching the financial solution in July, with plans to customize the
software for other industries which require the same level of management over
highly sensitive information; such as medical records, banking statements,
personnel records and insurance claims.

    About Sequel
