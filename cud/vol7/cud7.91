Subject: File 1--Re: CyberAngels

Dear Sirs:

     While some proposed activities of the "CyberAngels" are
difficult to object to, others are threats to violate the civil
liberties of users of the Internet. These can be classified into
two categories: violations of freedom of speech and press, and
violations of the rights of interaction of consenting adults. The
former would include their threatened actions regarding: allegedly
obscene material; "indecent" materials that they feel are too
available to persons under the age of 18; anonymous (and, one would
suspect, pseudonymous) speech; allegedly harassing speech; and
political ("hate") speech. Those regarding the activities of
consenting adults would, according to their phrasing, include any
actions illegal in the state or country in question, such as
homosexual activity in many U.S. states. In addition, the record of
the Guardian Angels suggests that they will step over even the
bounds that they publicly set for themselves.

     I would like to make a suggestion to the readers of the
Computer Underground Digest, and to other users of the Internet, as
to the best way to deal with this organization. This idea is to use
one problem (the "CyberAngels") to counter another (net-abuse such
as spamming). Simply forward copies of spamming (done via email,
USENET, or other means) to the "ganetwatch@aol.com" address, and
ask them to deal with the problem. Some of it is definitely
included under the "fraud" category in their statement (i.e.,
pyramid schemes such as "MAKE MONEY FAST"), and others are at the
minimum deprivation of service and possibly true harassment. I am
hopeful that the volume of mail received on this count will be
great enough that they will be unable to carry out any improper
actions. If they fail to try to do anything about the spamming
problem, then they can be exposed as frauds themselves. Other forms
of net-abuse that may be emailed to them would include falsified
rmgroup and cancel messages (if these were not committed by the
CyberAngels themselves, of course).

     This suggestion may be combined with the "cyberspawn" cancel
mechanism on Usenet, through a daemon at various sites
automatically mailing the spam to "ganetwatch@aol.com" prior (if
this is wanted) to cancellation. A form of it can also be used
against any other organization seeking informants via computer
networks.
     Sincerely Yours,
     -Allen Smith (EALLENSMITH@MBCL.RUTGERS.EDU)

This message may be freely redistributed on the Internet, on other
computer networks, and on BBSes if it is left completely intact and
the distributor is not a Guardian Angel. I encourage doing so.

Subject: File 2--Guardian Angel NOVEMBER NEWSLETTER

This is somewhat long, but attached is the November newsletter of the
Guardian Angels CyberAngels Internet Monitoring Project. I did not write any
of this, but am forwarding it as an item of interest.

Most notable is the allegation of contacting 50 separate sysadmins and
providing them with evidence about individual users trading child pornagraphy.

>********************
>Hi!  And a special welcome to the many of you who are new on our newsletter

>apologies. Our mailing list got damaged and we had to rebuild it from
>scratch!  Let us know (again!) if you wish to unsubscribe. Sorry!
>
>Firstly let me (Gabriel) introduce my colleague to you.  His name is Patrik
>Olterman, and he is originally from Sweden.  Like me he is a veteran Guardian
>Angel, and is now working with me coordinating the CyberAngels project.  FYI
>we are both based in Hollywood, CA.  No, not the nice part :)  Oh, and in the
>Guardian Angels he has a nickname.  We call him "Harlequin".
>
>The past month has been excellent for the project.  Firstly all thanks to
>SAFESURF - to Ray Soular and Wendy Simpson - for donating us a home page on
>the www.  This made our project global for the first time.  Safesurf and
>CyberAngels are working together as two concerned  groups, to help protect
>our cyberneighborhood.  Ray and Wendy are truly are good people.  THANKS you
>guys!  We encourage all our volunteers and newsletter members to check out
>Safesurf's home pages and to subscribe to their newsletter.  You can reach
>them via hyperlink from the CyberAngels home page at

>Read especially Safesurf's "Declaration of an Independent InterNet"  We
>support it 100% !
>
>By the way, if you have already visited our homepage, VISIT IT AGAIN! :)  We
>will be changing and developing it, and adding more links, as we develop our
>project.  We would certainly welcome your suggestions as to how we can
>improve things.

>INTERNET AND COMPUTER EXPO IN FLORIDA

>We will be down in Florida for the 1,2 and 3 December, with a booth at the

>INTERNET PATROLS LAST MONTH
>
>We have been DELUGED with information and education about what is happening
>all over the Net in the past month.  Special mention must go to one of our
>CyberAngels, whose userid is Techphob.  Tech has been patrolling all KINDS of
>dark alleys and dangerous cyberhoods, and the information he is accumulating
>earns him a special mention as our CYBERANGEL OF THE MONTH.  Not only has he
>been assembling huge lists of the red light area of the InterNet, and
>painstakingly researching them, which is not a pleasant task.  TECHPHOB, when
>you die you will go to CYBERHEAVEN. :)  Keep up the excellent work.  And if
>one person can do so much, think what we can  ALL do if we work together.
>
>We have reported a number of Child Pornographers (50) to Sysadmins this
>month.  This was done only after we received from them graphic images
>(unsolicited) of child pornography.  We forwarded the email, including the
>attached files, to respective ISPs with the question "Is this a violation of
>your TOS?  And if it is, what disciplinary steps will you take?"  Letters we
>have received back all share our concern and promise stern action.
>
>Child pornographers are claiming "freedom of speech / expression" to justify
>their evil trade.  Well we are claiming "freedom of speech / expression" to
>try and stop it!  Thank you to all our volunteers who did NOT look the other
>way but stood up and said NO.  Remember, each electronic image represents a
>real life destroyed.
>
>Many people are unsure when they find things whether to contact ISPs
>(InterNet Service Providers) themselves, by writing to relevant System
>Administrators, or to forward the information to us at CyberAngels Central -
>well do both!  We can not possibly investigate everything that you all find,
>so take the step and speak up if you feel there is a TOS (Terms of Service)
>violation.  Write to the ISP and explain the situation and ask the question
>"Is this a violation of your TOS?".   Remember, we will not report anything
>we do not investigate ourselves.  We do not operate on hearsay.   So if you
>find something, give us full information as to how we may find it.
>
>An educational story to finish this section.  One of our CyberAngels drew our
>attention last month to a very nasty posting in alt.teens on the Usenet. We
>checked itout and then wrote to the Sysadmin.  It was a posting from a 16
>year old girl and was extremely nasty (obscene).  Not only that but the
>userid indicated that the server was at a girls school in England.  I wrote
>to the Sysadmin and asked the question "Are you aware that one of your girls
>is posting this kind of material to this newsgroup?"  He investigated the
>matter, and it turned out apparently that the postings came not from a 16
>year old girl at all, but from an older, MALE, member of the teaching staff.

>With global exposure, and an increasing number of online and offline

>A copy of our FAQ was sent to CUDigest (an online magazine), and it started

>
>Special mention must go to an ongoing debate about anonymous remailers, which
>was an area where we were less informed.  Thanks to  an154280@anon.penet.fi

>debate about anonymity we have two suggestions:  firstly we have a HUGE FAQ
>on "Identity, Privacy and Anonymity on the InterNet", written by L.Detweiler,
>and if any of you want it, please write to us and ask for it (WARNING it is
>138k!)  Secondly you can write to help@anon.penet.fi for their FAQ on their
>anonymous service, which is also very educational.

>Secondly, if any of you have ANYTHING relevant you would like to see printed

>
>Send us press articles etc, especially translations from countries where
>english is not spoken, about the InterNet and what is happening.  Let's hear
>some good news about all the excellent organizations working for a safer
>InterNet!
>
>Another question - what is X-Band?  We think it is a game playing BBS, but we
>are not sure.  Anyway, no one on X-Band can receive email longer than 5

>The Program is called Cyber Angels and like the Guardian Angel street patrols

>Authorities have made sporadic attempts to lock up these computer pedophiles
>but the successes of these campaigns have just gone to show how blatant and

>A private investigator who was upset by the use of the world wide computer

Subject: File 3--Re: CuD, #7.89 - Govt & Net Censorship

just some thoughts that crossed my mind, and wich I thought I would
share with you.

there was a time when the US where great and wonderful to me (this was
when I was young and easily impressed by things as Silicon Valley and
the NASA).  Then came the time to keep up with news and such, and
gradually the US became in my view a place where the best, the worst
and especially the most silly things were possible (e.g. the sexual
harassment laws of the US, wich are laughably extreme in the views of
most Europeans). But now it has finally happened, a very powerful
group (The Religious Right) has clearly gone too far.

I don't mean to insult the US in general, but if the bill, the
Religious Right wants to pass, does pass, then the US risk to be left
out from the international community. IMHO (untill Europe imitates the
US, as always 10 years or so later) the US will simply left out from
the internet. Rather than risking having bigots laws on one's back and
being sued all the way to the end of the known galaxy, people will
IMHO just avoid the US.

Are those who want to pass the bill aware of this? I doubt it. I would
really miss all the people I am in contact with in the US, but then
again I don't want to get in trouble just because if my language or my
general moral views. (No, I'm not a child abuser, but the sense of
humor I inherited by living in France for many years will probably be
enough to get me into trouble. Just imagine telling a sick baby joke
with a sexual conotation to sb residing in the US will get me and my
ISP or university in deep trouble instead of just generating a "bah,
that was not really funny, you know.")

What will happen to the US if all major firms relocate to other
coutries because of the legislation being just laughably strict? I
don't want to paint gloomy end-of-world-scenes regarding the US, but
IMHO there is a danger of this.

Subject: File 4--French agreement to use Netscape Navigator
Date: 21 Nov 1995 08:49:06 GMT

Bonjour,

All over the French newgroups, you can read the uncredibled news this
morning: the secret SCSSI (Service Central de la Securite des Systemes
d'Information) from the Premier Ministre' desk in Paris have given the
complete
agreement to use Netscape Navigator. The document is like that:

   Titre: "Autorisation de fourniture et d'utilisation generale de moyens
     de cryptologie No. 2500"
   Signe: 7 Novembre 1995
   Par: Jacques VINCENT-CARREFOUR pour la DISSI
   Reference: 509/DISSI dossier numero 950038

   L'autorisation est fournie aux seuls produits Netscape Navigator suivants:

        N. DOS WINDOWS CD ROM
        N. DOS WINDOWS KX 23
        N. MACINTOSH CD ROM
        N. MACINTOSH RX23
        N. NT/INTEL CD ROM
        N. NT/INTEL RX23
        N. NT/ALPHA
        N. X-WINDOWS
        N. WIN/95 16 BIT CD ROM
        N. WIN/95 16 BIT RX 23
        N. WIN/95 32 BIT CD ROM
        N. WIN/95 32 BIT RX 23

   Elle est egalement fournie aux distributeurs de la liste suivante et a
eux seuls:

        Sun Microsystems Computers
        Digital Equipment
        Silicon Graphics
        Novell
        Siemens Nixdorf
        Olivetti
        Bull
        Zenith Data Systems
        Apple Computers
        Hewlett Packard
        Compaq
        Azlan
        Softway
        France Telecom
        Grolier Interactive Europe
        General Games

Some remarks can be do: it's no "s" to X-Window in the list of authorized
products. This
agreement "is good until 1st October 1997 for selling and use in France
only." This autho-
rization will be late to be given because of some discussions with other
hurge software
publishers that don't have receive the same paper.

It's the first time in France that an US specific software will be accepted
in the cryptographic
field by our Government. Bravo -:>]

* New York Civil Liberties Union Opposes Discipline of Cornell Students for
Offensive Online Speech

The latest controversy over appropriate use of the Internet at universities
erupted last week after four Cornell students made a list of "75 reasons why
women should not have freedom of speech" and the list got loose on the
Internet.  Responding to e-mail and phone complaints about the message,
Cornell considered disciplinary action against the students.

The NYCLU wrote a letter to Cornell on Thursday, November 16th, urging
Cornell not to proceed with disciplinary action.  The letter said, "Freedom
of expression, especially in the academic forum, is designed to encourage
truth-seeking by protecting the challenge and response of intellectual
discourse. . . .  It is understandable that university officials should be
concerned about the increase in the use of sexist language. . . .  However,
no matter how troubling or offensive the message is, the administration of
Cornell University should not depart from principles of freedom of expression
when addressing the issues surrounding this dispute."  The letter went on to
note that "the marketplace theory of free expression appears to be in full
swing as the wrong-minded e-mail message has apparently already provoked
 thousands of angry messages' both to Cornell and to the particular four
students."

On Thursday afternoon, Cornell announced that it would not pursue any
disciplinary action against the students.

For a copy of the letter that NYCLU sent to Cornell, send a message to
infoaclu@aclu.org with "NYCLU Letter to Cornell" in the subject line.  For
more information, contact Beth Haroules, Staff Attorney, NYCLU, at

*     Seattle Negotiates New Franchise Agreement with Cable Network to Offer
Internet Access; ACLU of Washington Testifies at Hearing on Privacy
Implications

Cities across the country are beginning to renegotiate franchise agreements
with cable networks who want to get into the Internet access business.  Civil
libertarians must work to ensure that strong privacy protections are included
in these agreements.

The City of Seattle is currently negotiating a new franchise agreement with
TCI of Seattle, Inc., and the ACLU of Washington urged the city to include
provisions to protect consumer privacy.  In a letter dated November 9th,
ACLU-W said that "franchisees should be prohibited from collecting any data
on individual use of the cable network, including Internet access, except
that data minimally needed for billing purposes. . . .  [T]he franchisee
should be precluded from collecting information about which other Internet
sites are accessed through the cable network, which newsgroups are read,
which real-time interactive forums are participated in, or any other
information that could be used to compile a data profile of the subscriber."
 The letter also urged the city to require technological protections, like
encryption, to guard against unauthorized tapping.

franchise agreement" in the subject line.  For more information, contact Doug
Klunder, ACLU-W Information Technology Committee, dougk@eskimo.com.

FEDERAL PAGE (Congress/Agency/Court Cases)
----------------------------------------------------------------
*     Watch Out for Cyber-Liberties Infringements in Counter-Terrorism
Legislation; House May Consider Bill in Early December

The House of Representatives is scheduled to debate a broad counter-terrorism
bill in early December.  (The Senate passed a similar bill in June 1995.)
 While the counter-terrorism bill contains many unconstitutional provisions,
the net community should be particularly alert to the following:

1.  The pending House counter-terrorism bill contains a funding mechanism for
vastly expanded wiretap capabilities for federal law enforcement (authorized
by the Digital Telephony law passed by Congress last year). The FBI's scheme
would give government an unprecedented ability to intrude on privacy through
increased wiretaps.  The net community should oppose this and any other
funding scheme for the FBI's wiretap proposal.  (See our 11/8 issue of the
Cyber-Liberties Update for an ACLU statement and action alert on the federal
wiretap proposal.)

2.  The version of counter-terrorism legislation already passed by the Senate
contains a revised Feinstein Amendment, which makes it a felony "to
distribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the
manufacture of explosive materials, if the person intends, or knows that such
explosive materials or information will likely be used for" criminal
purposes.  While the legislation applies to all media, it grew out of Senator
Feinstein's vilification of the Internet at the Senate's May 11th
counter-terrorism  hearings.  The House version of counter-terrorism
legislation does not currently contain language like the Feinstein Amendment,
but the online community should stand ready to oppose any effort to include
such unconstitutional provisions in the final House bill.

For a copy of the ACLU's letter to the Senate in opposition to the original
Feinstein Amendment, send a message to infoaclu@aclu.org with "Feinstein
Amendment" in the subject line.

For further information on the ACLU's opposition to counter-terrorism
legislation (which would also expand the FBI's powers in electronic
surveillance and other areas), visit the ACLU's Constitution Hall on America
Online, at keyword ACLU.

----------------------------------------------------------------
*     Update and ACTION ALERT on Federal Online Indecency Legislation

The Conference Committee on the telecommunications bill is currently
considering whether to remove provisions that would make "indecency" and
other speech a crime in cyberspace.  The Christian Coalition and other
anti-free-speech groups continue to heavily lobby the Conferees to make the
new speech crimes even stricter than the Exon Amendment.  To counter this
backlash, the online community must overwhelm the Conference Committee with a
loud and clear message -- that parental empowerment tools and not big
government censorship are the only effective means to address children's
access to online content.

While the Conference Committee is home for Thanksgiving, we urge you to call
the Conferees in your state.  To find a list of the home office phone numbers
for the Conferees, see the current ACTION ALERT at http://www.vtw.org/

The ACLU continues to prepare for a constitutional challenge to the online
censorship provisions if they become law.  Please contact Ann Beeson,
beeson@aclu.org, if your organization is interested in being a plaintiff in
this ground-breaking litigation that will define First Amendment rights in
cyberspace.
