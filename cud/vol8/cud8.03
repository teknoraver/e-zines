Subject: File 1--CDT: Telecom Bill Overview and Proposal Text (FINALLY!)

From:  CDT POLICY POST Number 33                      January 4, 1996

 (1) TEXT OF LATEST VERSION OF THE CDA -- STILL UNCONSTITUTIONAL

 The House/Senate telecommunications reform conference committee has
 released a preliminary draft of the final telecommunications reform bill,
 which includes provisions which would impose broad government regulations
 on constitutionally protected speech online. The text of these provisions
 is attached below.

 The attached version of the CDA contains the changes approved at the
 December 6, 1995 conference committee meeting, where members voted to adopt
 Rep. Rick White's proposal but with significant changes, including a return
 to the unconstitutional "indecency" standard (See CDT Policy Post No. 32,
 12/6/95).

 The conferees have made several important changes to the legislation, none
 of them are particularly favorable to cyberspace-rights advocates. Among
 other things, the latest draft:

 * Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency"
   standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))

 * Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making
   indecent material available for display in a manner available to a
   minor (including world wide web pages, ftp sites, or usenet
   newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).

 * No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill
   prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the
   Internet or other interactive media.

 * Contains weaker protections for content providers who label content
   and enable others to block it (e.g., PICS) have been weakened (Sec 502
   (e)(5).

 * Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial
   activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers
   (Sec 502 (h)).

 * Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer,
   the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec
   508).

 The full text of the new proposal is attached below.

 CDT believes that this proposal threatens the very existence of the
 Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political
 discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by
 the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.

 NEXT STEPS: FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED, VOTE COULD OCCUR SOON

 As you know, the CDA is part of the massive telecommunications reform
 legislation, which is currently being considered by a House/Senate
 conference committee.

 The conference committee has not reached agreement on several key  issues,
 including whether the FCC should be permitted to regulate the Internet,
 broadcast ownership rules, and other issues. Reps. Rick White, Chris Cox,
 and others are currently fighting to retain the provisions baring the FCC
 from regulating online content. A final vote by the conferees to send the
 bill to the full congress will not occur until an agreement is reached on
 this and other outstanding issues.

 As of Thursday January 4, 1996, the conferees have NOT yet voted to send a
 version of the legislation to the Full House and Senate for a final vote.
 No vote has been scheduled, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has stated that
 no vote will occur until Congress finishes work on the Budget.

 CDT will continue to fight these provisions, and will work to remove them
 from the final telecommunications bill. We are also preparing to fight this
 issue in court, if necessary.

 WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

 The Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW) has organized an online coalition
 (of which CDT is a member) against the net-censorship bill. To find out

ESSAY

By John Perry Barlow

THINKING LOCALLY, ACTING GLOBALLY

An ex-cowboy and rock lyricist turned Internet activist takes on the
censors of cyberspace

Two weeks ago, a prosecutor in Munich managed, almost casually, to strike a
global blow against freedom of expression. Though he is a person of such
obscurity that most of the accounts I've read of this incident didn't even
mention his name, he has been able to constrict the information flow for
some 4 million people in 140 countries.

He did this merely by telling CompuServe, the world's second largest
online-service provider, that it was breaking Bavarian law by giving
Germans access to Usenet discussion groups believed to include explicit
sexuality. A strangely terrified CompuServe responded by removing any
newsgroups whose title contained the word sex, gay or erotic, thus blocking
access to all subscribers, not just those in Germany. Given the centralized
nature of its operations-and the decentralized nature of Usenet-this was,
according to CompuServe, the only way it could comply.

Thus were CompuServe subscribers prevented from further discourse on
whatever they talk about in alt.sex.bestiality.hamster.duct-tape (which may
exceed even my high squeamishness threshold). At the same time, however,
they were also barred from alt.religion.sexuality (a pretty chaste topic),
clari.news.sex (which redistributes wire-service stories) and
alt.sex.marsha-clark (the mind reels =8A).

Once again, the jackboots of the Industrial Era can be heard stomping
cluelessly around the Infobahn. In fact, the Germans did almost nothing to
stanch the flow of sexual materials. The newsgroups that CompuServe removed
are still active on millions of computers worldwide. CompuServe subscribers
in Bavaria or anywhere else can simply switch to a less timid online
service and re-enter the discussion. As Internet pioneer John Gilmore once
said, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."

Such assaults are most likely to injure the large service providers, sober
institutions more culturally attuned to their governmental attackers than
the info-guerrillas of cyberspace. CompuServe, for its cowardice in folding
without a fight, probably deserves the calumny heaped on it by angry users.
The company says it hopes to reopen access to all but its German
subscribers as soon as it can figure out how.

But the issue at stake here is larger than whether the good people of
Munich can prevent others half a world away from looking at pictures of
sexually misused hamsters. These apparently trivial struggles may in fact
be the opening fissures of a historical discontinuity.

The real issue is control. The Internet is too widespread to be easily
dominated by any single government. By creating a seamless global-economic
zone, borderless and unregulatable, the Internet calls into question the
very idea of a nation-state. No wonder nation-states are rushing to get
their levers of control into cyberspace while less than 1% of the world's
population is online.

What the Net offers is the promise of a new social space, global and
antisovereign, within which anybody, anywhere can express to the rest of
humanity whatever he or she believes without fear. There is in these new
media a foreshadowing of the intellectual and economic liberty that might
undo all the authoritarian powers on earth.

That's why Germany, the People's Republic of China and the U.S. are girding
to fight the Net, using the popular distaste for prurience as their longest
lever. After all, who is willing to defend depictions of sexual intercourse
with children and animals? Moving through the U.S. Congress right now is a
telecommunications-reform bill that would impose fines of as much as
$100,000 for "indecency" in cyberspace. Indecent (as opposed to obscene)
material is clearly protected in print by the First Amendment, and a large
percentage of the printed material currently available to Americans,
whether it be James Joyce's Ulysses or much of what's in Cosmopolitan
magazine, could be called indecent. As would my saying, right here, right
now, that this bill is full of shit.

Somehow Americans lost such protections in broadcast media, where coarse
language is strictly regulated. The bill would hold expression on the Net
to the same standards of purity, using far harsher criminal
sanctions-including jail terms-to enforce them. Moreover, it would attempt
to impose those standards on every human who communicates electronically,
whether in Memphis or Mongolia. Sounds crazy, but it's true.

If the U.S. succeeds in censoring the Net, it will be in a position to
achieve far more than smut reduction. Any system of control that can stop
us from writing dirty words online is a system that can control our
collective conversation in other, more important ways. If the nation-states
perfect such methods, they may own enough of the mind of mankind to
perpetuate themselves far beyond their usefulness.

If that sounds overstated to you, consider the millions of people one
prosecutor in Germany was able to mute with little more than an implied
threat.

Subject: File 3--Ron Wyden's statement on Net censorship


Wyden Backs Freedom of Access on the Internet; Believes Parents, not
Bureaucrats Can Best Protect Children Against Cyberporn

                   Statement by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)

There are many differences between my opponent Gordon Smith and me in
the U.S. Senate race in Oregon.  One of the clearest is on the
subject of censorship of the Internet.

When Gordon was asked at our recent debate at the City Club in
Portland if the federal government should censor the Internet, he
replied, "Yes, I do."

As the father of two computer-literate children, I join the millions
of American parents who want to keep smut and pornography away from
our kids using the Internet.  But I believe parents and families, not
government bureaucrats, are better suited to guard the portals of
cyberspace and protect our kids.

Gordon Smith believes otherwise.  His support for federal censorship
of the Internet echoes the heavy-handed regulatory approach proposed
by Senator Exxon that is now part of the telecommunications
legislation.

If Congress adopts this method, it will lead to countless
constitutional challenges and unprotected families.

I support a different approach.  Last summer I introduced legislation
with Congressman Chris Cox (R-California) to clean up the Internet
while preserving the efficiency and open access of the world-wide
computer network.  Entitled the "Internet Freedom and Family
Empowerment Act," the bill sought to encourage and protect private
sector initiatives that improve user control over computer
information services.

In the meantime, parents do not have to wait for Congress to act to
protect their children against cyberporn.  Reasonably priced software
that blocks pornography on the Internet is available now at
neighborhood computer stores.

The proper role of government in protecting our children against
cyberporn is to support efforts by the marketplace to create such
software and other filtering technologies.   What the Internet does
not need is what Gordon Smith wants:  big government telling you what
you can and cannot read and see.
