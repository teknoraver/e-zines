Subject--CIS censorship--The whole story
Date--Sat, 06 Jan 1996 09:33:39 GMT

Dear Nettizens,

Some few fivehundred postings ago, I promised you let you have more
details about the CompuServe censorship case investigated by the
editorial staff of SPIEGEL online. It is not a story of evil but of
people acting overambitious and ignorant. And it is not quite as
simple as DrG might be wishing!

To keep it short, here are the facts:

In 1994, a Task Force called "AG EDV" was set up by the Bavarian
Minister of Interior at the Police Headquarters in Munich. Initially,
the Task Force was formed to search persons dealing with pornographic
material via BTX the former online service of German Telekom and its
work was limited to one year.

For the moment, investigations of this Task Force ran successfully due
to the assistance of Telekom. But simultaneously, people being
suspected changed their ways of distributing  either to closed BBS
systems or chose more secret methods. So the Task Force was compelled
to enhance their efforts and they raided Munich BBS systems.
Furthermore, they studied computer magazines to find ads for
pornographic CD-ROMs. During this operation they found what they were
looking for, and "PC Direkt", a Ziff Davis publication, and some other
magazine were forced to pulp some issues.

All activities of the Task Force could not have happened, if they were
not supported by a whole bunch of local prosecutors and judges.
Sticking together, chatting, doing favours forms a part of the social
life in Munich - in malicious words - the 'Munich swamp'.

The prevailing opinion of the Task Force and of some prosecutors is
that carriers of digital information could held responsible for the
content of what they are spreading. This meaning matches exactly the
content of the CDA. But this is only one point of view. Up to now,
there doesn't exist any law or direction in Germany concerning
responsibilities of ISPs or online services regarding contents they
only do deliver. And so, judges decide from case to case. The German
department of justice thinks that carriers could be held responsible
if they deliver illegal content "deliberately". But then, could one
call them "carriers"?

Last summer, a kind of hysteria about Internet pornography broke out
in German media. A few journalist had made their first steps in the
Internet and discovered nasty postings in the
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica Usenet hierarchy. A student of Erlangen
University was seized because of spreading child porn via Usenet.
Then, the "Time" article about Internet porn was published and quoted
by nearly every German newspaper.

I think at that time the Task Force planned to investigate the Usenet.
Due to the facts that CIS had become a big ISP and their German office
is located in Munich, CIS seemed to be a worthwhile target. Somehow
the Task Force managed to get a search warrant to investigate the
Munich CIS office on November, 22nd.  However, the search was more or
less like a visit. Let me quote the public prosecutor: CompuServe "was
quite cooperative". "We sat together talking about chances to kick
pornographic contents out of CompuServe's information system." The
police officers just collected a copy of the CompuServe association
contract and the address of the CEO.

Two days later, CompuServe's German managers published that they "will
do anything to support the work of German authorities fighting against
pornography in Cyberspace". On December, 8th, CIS was handled a list
of more than 200 newsgroups by the Task Force. In my opinion,
interpreting the prosecutor and the CIS spokeswoman, this list was
presented to CIS as containing "suspicious newsgroups". In the
attached letter from the prosecutor it is said: "... it is left to
CompuServe to take the necessary steps to avoid possible liabilities
to punishment."

So, if CompuServe should have ever had threats, it could have been
only very small ones. But there is no reason to their German
management to risk anything. CompuServe's approach is not to guarantee
for "freedom of speech and information" but  to make "money".

When i interviewed the prosecutor, it soon became quite clear that his
department had tried to bring CIS to court to get its legal position
checked by some judges. Because of CIS servile tactics they had to
give up their goal.

The ominous list itself shows, how ignorant the members of the Task
Force are about the Usenet. In my opinion, they just sampled all
newsgroups containing words like "sex", "erotic", "gay" and so on and
put the result onto the list.

We have two in depth articles on the whole affair on our web server.
One is an extended version of what i've posted here, the other deals
with the CDA and the actual political and legal situation concerning
the Internet. Unfortunately for US readers, these articles are in
German because we didn't found the time to translate them. But i hope
will can manage this until Monday 8th, 8:00 AM, EST. Then, you should

Subject: File 3--Court Rules in Pentagon Cit

In a case litigated by EPIC staff, the federal appeals court in
Washington, DC, has ordered the U.S. Secret Service to release
information concerning a controversial "hacker" investigation.
The January 2 ruling partially rejected the agency's three-year
attempt to withhold documents concerning the 1992 "Pentagon City
Mall Raid."  In November of that year, a group of young people
affiliated with the computer magazine "2600" were confronted by
mall security personnel, local police officers and several
unidentified individuals in the Virginia shopping mall.  The group
members were ordered to identify themselves and to submit to
searches of their personal property.  Their names were recorded
and some of their property was confiscated.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) filed suit
in federal court in early 1993 seeking the release of relevant
Secret Service records under the Freedom of Information Act.  The
litigation of the case has been handled by the Electronic Privacy
Information Center (EPIC).  In July 1994, U.S. District Judge
Louis Oberdorfer ordered the Secret Service to release the vast
majority of documents it maintains on the incident.  The
government appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, which partially affirmed the
lower court decision in the recent ruling.

The appeals court rejected the agency's attempt to invoke a
blanket claim of "source confidentiality" for all information
involving investigations of computer crime, noting that "the
Service offered no evidence that a fear of retaliation by hackers
is sufficiently widespread to justify an inference that sources of
information relating to computer crimes expect their identities
and the information they provide to be kept confidential."  The
court did, however, uphold the agency's claim that information
identifying particular individuals should be withheld from
disclosure.

decision, is available at:

Subject: File 4--CDT: Telecom Bill Overview and Proposal Text (FINALLY!)

From:  CDT POLICY POST Number 33                      January 4, 1996

 (1) TEXT OF LATEST VERSION OF THE CDA -- STILL UNCONSTITUTIONAL

 The House/Senate telecommunications reform conference committee has
 released a preliminary draft of the final telecommunications reform bill,
 which includes provisions which would impose broad government regulations
 on constitutionally protected speech online. The text of these provisions
 is attached below.

 The attached version of the CDA contains the changes approved at the
 December 6, 1995 conference committee meeting, where members voted to adopt
 Rep. Rick White's proposal but with significant changes, including a return
 to the unconstitutional "indecency" standard (See CDT Policy Post No. 32,
 12/6/95).

 The conferees have made several important changes to the legislation, none
 of them are particularly favorable to cyberspace-rights advocates. Among
 other things, the latest draft:

 * Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency"
   standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))

 * Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making
   indecent material available for display in a manner available to a
   minor (including world wide web pages, ftp sites, or usenet
   newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).

 * No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill
   prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the
   Internet or other interactive media.

 * Contains weaker protections for content providers who label content
   and enable others to block it (e.g., PICS) have been weakened (Sec 502
   (e)(5).

 * Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial
   activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers
   (Sec 502 (h)).

 * Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer,
   the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec
   508).

 The full text of the new proposal is attached below.

 CDT believes that this proposal threatens the very existence of the
 Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political
 discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by
 the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.

 NEXT STEPS: FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED, VOTE COULD OCCUR SOON

 As you know, the CDA is part of the massive telecommunications reform
 legislation, which is currently being considered by a House/Senate
 conference committee.

 The conference committee has not reached agreement on several key  issues,
 including whether the FCC should be permitted to regulate the Internet,
 broadcast ownership rules, and other issues. Reps. Rick White, Chris Cox,
 and others are currently fighting to retain the provisions baring the FCC
 from regulating online content. A final vote by the conferees to send the
 bill to the full congress will not occur until an agreement is reached on
 this and other outstanding issues.

 As of Thursday January 4, 1996, the conferees have NOT yet voted to send a
 version of the legislation to the Full House and Senate for a final vote.
 No vote has been scheduled, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has stated that
 no vote will occur until Congress finishes work on the Budget.

 CDT will continue to fight these provisions, and will work to remove them
 from the final telecommunications bill. We are also preparing to fight this
 issue in court, if necessary.

 WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

 The Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW) has organized an online coalition
