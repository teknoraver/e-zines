Subject: File 1--REMINDER - CuD is Changing Servers - RESUBS ARE NECESSARY

              *** CuD IS CHANGING SERVERS *** RE-SUB NOW

In about mid-January, Cu Digest will be moving to a new server
at weber.ucsd.edu. We're following the strong consensus of
readers and requiring that, to continue to receive CuD after
mid-January, you must RE-SUBSCRIBE.

Although the move will not take place for a few weeks, you can enter
your subscribtion before then, so WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUB NOW.

Re-subbing is easy. Just send a message with this in the
   "Subject:" line
           SUBSCRIBE CU-DIGEST

send it to:

   cu-digest-request@weber.ucsd.edu

Issues will still be sent out from the older server for a few weeks,
so the strategy is to collect the resubs first, and then make the
transition.

If you prefer to access CuD from Usenet, use
    comp.society.cu-digest

If you prefer archives, you can use the ftp/www site at
ftp.eff.org (or www.eff.org) or the CuD archives at:
http://www.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest.

We also hope to have a mail archive set up soon as well.

You can still contact the moderators at:
        cudigest@sun.soci.niu.edu
or      tk0jut2@mvs.cso.niu.edu

Please *DO NOT* send inquiries to the server at UIUC.

COMPUSERVE(R) SUSPENDS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC INTERNET NEWSGROUPS

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 28, 1995 -- During the past week, CompuServe
Incorporated temporarily suspended access to more than 200 Internet
newsgroups in response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor s office in
Germany.  Each of the newsgroups that was suspended was specifically
identified to CompuServe by the German authorities as illegal under German
criminal law.  CompuServe did not select any groups or determine the
nature of the newsgroups that have been impacted by this action.
        German government officials, as part of an investigation of
illegal material on the Internet, ordered CompuServe to do what was
necessary with respect to specified newsgroups in order to comply with
German law.  German authorities are investigating newsgroups and other
Internet content that may contain child pornography, other pornographic
material illegal for adults, as well as content that although not illegal
for adults is of such an explicit nature that it is illegal for minors.
        While access has been suspended, CompuServe continues to work with
German authorities to resolve this matter.  CompuServe cannot alter the
content on the Internet in any way and has only suspended access to the
disputed newsgroups through CIS.  The issues being investigated in
Germany, like those being addressed across the industry, need to remain
focused on the individuals and groups placing content on the Internet.
CompuServe, as an access provider, is not responsible for the origination
or nature of content on the Internet over which it has no creative or
editorial control.

        The global market is vital to CompuServe.  We currently have
500,000 members in Western Europe and anticipate doubling that number in
the next year. As the leading global service, CompuServe must comply with
the laws of the many countries in which we operate. However, laws in
different countries are often in conflict, and this creates new challenges
unique to the emerging online industry.  CompuServe is investigating ways
in which we can restrict user access to selected newsgroups by
geographical location.

I must admit that I am not familiar with _all_ of these newsgroups, but
this is reported to be an accurate list of the groups blocked by
CompuServe at the request of the Bavarian prosecutors.

---------- Forwarded message begins here ----------

Subject--Stop the Censorship!
Date--30 Dec 1995 23:51:35 GMT

Feel free to distribute or post the following letter where ever you see
fit:

Germany is setting the standards of free speech for the entire world,
and Compuserve is going along.  This is the first major case of
censorship on the internet, and it is important that it is also the
last.  The eyes of every internet provider, of the US Congress and other
governments are on this case to see how it develops.

German prosecutors threatened Compuserve for allowing access to Usenet
groups that they deemed to be unacceptable.  Compuserve responded by
censoring it's users over the whole world, by banning these newsgroups.
If Germany tried to threaten a US phone company for allowing people to
use dirty words on an international phone call the phone company would
refuse to comply.  Compuserve, given this same choice, chose to censor.
They have chosen to take responsibility for the content of everything
that crosses through their system, and to reject some of it.

One way to prevent such things from happening again is to make sure that
this censorship is not in the economic best interest of Compuserve, and
Germany.  If they want to interfere with First Amendment rights, then we
should exercise our First Amendment rights to not communicate with them.
A boycott can be a very effective tool, that can work even if you are
not a Compuserve user.  They have made a decision about community
standards for the world, if you agree that they do not have that right,
then do not accept their standards.  If you are a Compuserve subscriber
then cancel your account.

Germany and Compuserve have chosen to selectively cut themselves off
from the rest of the internet community, let's make it a complete
separation.  Do not send any E-mail to Compuserve or Germany.  Do not
reply to any newsgroup posts, and do not access any of their web pages.
If you receive E-mail, then simply ignore it, send a copy of this
letter, or your own explanation that you will no longer use a system
that censors.  If both Germany and Compuserve can be made into the
pariahs of the internet world then perhaps others will get the message
that censorship of the 'net is not acceptable and will only succeed in
destroying the 'net.

The World Wide Web should allow the exchange of any ideas around the
world.  It should not be limited to the minimum acceptable ideas that
are allowed in any one of the countries or companies.  If the
information that is available on the 'net is allowed to be only that
which is acceptable to people in Germany, Iran, Iraq, China and the US
Congress, then the net will be useless.  If any one government, company
or entity, large or small, is allowed that much control of expression
then the freedom on the internet is lost to everyone.

From--Brad Templeton <brad@alto.clari.net>

Alas, we were also pretty shocked to see some ClariNet e.news newsgroups
listed in the set that Compuserve announced it was banning from their
servers in fear of German censorship laws -- but mostly because Compuserve
isn't one of our subscribers, and they don't have any of our groups.

We've asked them why they listed them, and not yet heard back, but I
think this is actually a very good example of how capricious and dangerous
such laws are.  They send people into panics, banning anything that
looks dangerous, even things they don't even have!  If anybody needs a
lesson on why laws like the German laws (and the upcoming U.S. decency
act) have a chilling effect far beyond even their broad intent, this is it.

Had Compuserve carried our electronic newspaper newsgroups, banning these
ones would have been silly.   Here are the "lurid" headlines from the last
few days of clari.news.sex, a newsgroup that contains only professional
reporting on sex-related issues...

        Vatican: Sex education not okay
        Suspended Teacher To Return
        Australian Govt Porn Committee Calls For Action
        Beijing seizes one million porn, illegal books
        Time for the annual best and worst lists
        China customs crack down on pornography imports
        CompuServe suspends online sex topics
        CompuServe bans sex groups, sparking free-speech row

The most recent headlines from clari.news.gays as you can see are
equally non-lurid

        Failed Robbery Led To Gay Slay
        Killer To Sell Story
        Gays In Military Judge Quits
        Lesbian Wins Job Bias Suit

I wonder if the Germans thought this was worth banning or CIS made up
the list on their own.  Either way, the the idea that anybody might,
in fear of such laws or under the orders of such laws, ban legitimate
professional (and entirely non-lurid) coverage of issues like these
is really scary, and we hope our many legitimate subsribers in Germany
don't fall prey to this.  While the fact that CIS didn't actually have
our material makes this less interesting, a big part of the story is
that somebody was driven to remove stuff without even knowing what they
were removing.

Attached are excerpts from today's article in the Washington Post.
Compuserve is weaseling, implying German law forced them to censor not
just alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.*, but text-only political discussion
groups. And the Christian Coalition is supporting them, of course.

   "CompuServe must comply with the laws of the many countries in which
   we operate," said CompuServe spokesman William Giles. "However, laws
   in different countries are often in conflict, and this creates new
   challenges unique to the emerging on-line industry."

   "What CompuServe decided to do is a healthy thing," said Heidi
   Stirrup, [The Christian Coalition's] director of government relations.
   "I don't see that the Internet is going to be a lesser place" because
   access to hard-core sexually explicit material has been reduced.

Cyberporn Debate Goes International


   Germany Pulls the Shade On CompuServe, Internet

   By Kara Swisher
   Washington Post Staff Writer


   It's often been said that the Internet is a frontier where no one's
   laws apply. But last week, on one portion of the global computer
   network, German law took hold.

   CompuServe Inc., one of the largest on-line service providers in the
   United States, announced that it would temporarily ban access by all
   its customers worldwide to some sexually oriented material on the
   Internet in response to a request from prosecutors in Germany that the
   material be banned there.

   For technological reasons, CompuServe cannot block the access of just
   its 220,000 customers in Germany.

   "CompuServe must comply with the laws of the many countries in which
   we operate," said CompuServe spokesman William Giles. "However, laws
   in different countries are often in conflict, and this creates new
   challenges unique to the emerging on-line industry."

   The Christian Coalition, a church organization that has campaigned
   against pornography on-line, praised the service's move.

   "What CompuServe decided to do is a healthy thing," said Heidi
   Stirrup, the coalition's director of government relations. "I don't
   see that the Internet is going to be a lesser place" because access to
   hard-core sexually explicit material has been reduced...

   How far the restrictions will spread remains unclear.

   Margaret Ryan, a spokeswoman for America Online Inc., the Vienna
   on-line service that also operates in Germany, said her Virginia-based
   service had received no request to block the material to its German
   customers. She would not comment on what the service would do if asked
   to comply with such a demand. "We are investigating the situation,"
   she said. "But we have no ban."

   A spokesman for Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Network said it had
   received no request either, but noted that its network had built-in
   technology that allows parents to control what their children can
   reach.

   Both services said that unlike CompuServe, they have the technological
   means to block just in Germany. That way, U.S. customers' access would
   not be affected...

   The German government request is aimed at about 200 of the Internet's
   15,000 newsgroups, which are message boards covering topics as diverse
   as sailing, chess and the jokes of late-night TV show host David
   Letterman.

   The ones targeted by Germany in an ongoing investigation are sexually
   graphic and explicit in nature and include child pornography in a
   manner that German prosecutors consider illegal under their criminal
   law.

   If other countries follow Germany's lead, it could mean that on-line
   services might have to create a different offering for each country or
   only offer something to everyone that boils down to the lowest common
   denominator...

   Questions of which rules apply have been debated for decades
   concerning the print and broadcast media. "This is not unexpected,
   this conflict of laws, because it has gone on for all important
   emerging mediums," said Tony Rutkowski, executive director of the
   Internet Society, the Alexandria-based advisory body involved with
   Internet policy...

Below is the latest news from AOL.  Old trick, old news, but people still
fall for it, eh?

Subj:    ALERT: Password Security
Date:    95-12-31 07:40:09 EST
From:    Steve Case
To:      ZMacGordon

Dear Friend of America Online,

I want to raise your awareness about an issue that affects us all: the
importance of never revealing your password.

Recently there have been a few incidents where computer hackers have tried to
gain access to passwords by soliciting individuals online.  These hackers
have increased their level of sophistication so much that they have begun to
correspond in a style to make you believe they are representing America
Online.  Here's an edited excerpt from a recent e-mail attempt:


"Dear AOL Community Member:
AOL is experiencing major problems...Due to a virus that was recently
loaded...onto our main user database, containing most of our member
registration information, we are currently experiencing widespread system
failure. The problem originated...when our system was illegally breached by a
former AOL employee.
We believe the employee, who is currently being questioned by authorities,
loaded a virus into our database. Because we identified the problem quickly,
we were able to stop the problem before the entire database was deleted.
The files that were deleted, however, happened to be the database link
files...that link a user's password and screen name to the rest of their
account. We are currently...working with McAfee Associates (Anti-Virus), to
replace the lost files...
...Some of the effects as a result of not having the database link files
include: random log-off's, AOLnet runs slower, and Email may accidentally be
deleted. These problems are MAJOR inconveniences to our users, so we need
your help to fix the problem."


The letter continues, outlining the steps you must take to keep your account
active, and awarding you free online hours for your troubles.

Sending e-mail is just one tactic.  Another approach is by using IMs (Instant
Messages), where a hacker will notice you are online and try to pass himself
off as an employee.  Hackers sometimes scan chat areas and the member
directory for screen names.

Simply put, your passwords are like items in your safety deposit box.
 They're confidential.  YOU are the only person who should know your
password.  Giving someone (even unintentionally) your password -- especially
online -- is like handing over your wallet, keys, and other valuables to
complete strangers.

There is absolutely no reason why America Online would ever ask you for your
password! Be aware: NO EMPLOYEE OR REPRESENTATIVE OF AMERICA ONLINE WILL EVER
ASK YOU FOR YOUR PASSWORD, YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR TO VERIFY YOUR BILLING
INFORMATION ONLINE.  IF THEY DO, BE SUSPICIOUS AND TAKE ACTION--REPORT IT
IMMEDIATELY.

Here are some quick steps to keep your passwords secure:

1) Immediately change your passwords (at keyword PASSWORD) to at least 6
alphanumeric characters -- combination of letters and numbers -- for all of
your sub-accounts.  Delete unused sub-accounts.
2) NEVER use your screen name, first or last name, town, street, etc. as a
password. Do not use a common word.  Add a few digits to a word, or misspell
it.  Hackers use all kinds of programs that search for common words.
3) Inform spouses, children, and others who have access to your account to
take the same safety measures, and to NEVER give out passwords.
4) Report suspicious behavior at keyword STAFFPAGER immediately.

Computer hacking on America Online is not widespread.  But it's an activity
-- and an illegal act -- which hinders our ability to conduct business and
ensure a safe online community.

AOL will pursue all legal action and law enforcement protection within our
right to protect the security of our service.

We also rely on our members, partners, remote community leaders, and others
with overhead accounts much like a neighborhood watch program -- to help
crush hacking, to maintain confidentiality of the simplest personal belonging
(your password), and to report activity of this kind to AOL immediately.

If you have any questions, please discuss them with your contact at AOL.

Thank you, and have a Happy New Year.

Regards,

Steve Case

Subject: File 8--Reuters: Telecom Bill Nixed Until Budget Fixed

Earlier this afternoon, Reuters reported that Newt Gingrich says no
work will be done on the telecom bill until the budget mess is over:

       In response to a question about whether the telecommunications
       bill was on the table in talks with Senate leaders, Gingrich
       said there will be ''nothing on the telecom bill until we
       have a budget.''

Congressman Howard Berman
Briberspace
Washington D.C.

                  FROM CYBERSPACE TO BRIBERSPACE

"Religion:  The last refuge of scoundrels and politicians."
                                          -Mark Twain

I am taking this opportunity to write you from cyberspace in
vehement protest on this day--National Electronic Communications
Censorship Protest day.

Americans have fought and died for our guaranteed Constitutional
rights of freedom of speech, and now this Congress has decided
those sacrifices where made in vain--"we'll just wipe those away
... we'll do it for the kids."  The implication is--by some
perverse notion--that the kids will benefit with all americans'
free speech rights stripped away.  Someone's gone nuts in
briberspace.

Congressman, if you were an active Internet user, you would know
that Exon and his cronies have mis-characterized the perils of
cyberspace.  I have yet to find on thing obscene on the Net. If
cyberspace can't be free, and parents don't feel inclined to use
filtering technology or supervise their children, then the
Internet is not for those children--they are most likely lost
anyway through parental neglect.  The Internet, or government,
should not and cannot take the place of parents and teachers. The
government cannot censor information content.  You may know, we
already have laws against pornography and child abuse.  You know
it, I know it, the American People know it.  Don't think you're
going to get a extra vote from gutting the Constitution.  You saw
the front page of yesterday's Los Angeles Times I hope.  No
politician is going to spin this on into the "fighting
pornography" or "preventing Society's collapse."  The people are
brighter that this and you know it--by the 30% approval rating
Congress got two days ago.

I asked Senator Exon's office for a couple URL addresses for what
was in his blue book, and the address did not exist.  Perhaps the
Senator's staff put that stuff up?  Did you ask him where he got
the smut he was shocking everybody with? Perhaps he got his
information from Martin Rimm--the one who embarrassed Senator
Grassley?

There are kids killing each other in the streets of California,
and you want to send the BBS Sysop to prison for 2 years for
running a BBS that can possibly free people from their
hopelessness; because they might see an "indecent" word like
"tits" on a computer BBS, or by some fluke of filtering
technology, glimpse a picture of a naked woman.  I would have
hoped you efforts might have been a little less silly, and a
little more real-world productive--California kids are killing
each other in the streets, joining street gangs, engaged in
drive-by shootings, selling and using drugs.  But perhaps, during
the course of these activities, they are not hearing "indecent"
words, or aren't exposed to a picture of a naked woman?

The priorities in briberspace are upside-down.

I am talking about your support for Senator Exon's Communications
Decency Act.  There is nothing decent about this act--it is a
dark-ages political attempt at depriving your constituents of the
freedom of speech rights guaranteed them in the First Amendment
of the Constitution.

It amazes me how public servants in our secular government--with
its separation of church and state--can so easily embrace the
extremist political agenda of right wing religion zealots, hell
bend on lording-over speech and communications in the country,
like the Christian Coalition, and the Church of Scientology.  I
can only hope you did it for the PAC money, for any other
motivations for supporting unconstitutional law that I can think
of, is far worse.

Thus, I coin the space you work in--the halls of Congress--as
"briberspace:" That space where seemingly corrupt politicians
snidely ignore the people they are supposed to represent, and
meet in smoke-filed back rooms with the scoundrel political
action committees, taking bribes in return for their powerful
vote.

Make no mistake:  this IS the general scorn for Congress most
Americans feel.  In a recent poll only 30% of the public
gave Congress an approval rating.

The People are afraid of politicians like you--uninspired,
unthinking politicians--who think they are Kings or Queens meant
to lord-over the People of the land, protecting them from the
evils of information and thoughts that aren't government
approved: Politicians who at every turn, take yet another stab at
trying to take away that which the People have left--of any
value--their freedoms.

President Clinton said, "I can't understand how People can say
they love their country and hate their government."

It is the scoundrels and politicians held in deep scorn that the
People cannot stomach--I puked last Sunday night watching a scene
from the Movie "The Distinguished Gentleman" as the Congressman
took a PAC bribe. (I just wanted to share that with you.)  Yet,
the scoundrels and politicians seem to keep coming up with new
and innovative ways of stealing our liberty, at every turn, in
almost every back-room committee meeting.  Is it some new version
of fascism we're trying to secretly install?

Please think again, before you vote on the Communications Decency
Act that attempts to unconstitutionally deprive Americans (only)
of their free speech rights, with its "indecent speech"
provisions.  Government does not have the business trying to
regulate content in communications.  And, I don't think your
going to be willing to build a communications wall around the
borders. Have you ever thought of off-shore Internet Service
Providers?  Have you ever thought you might be destroying a
multi-billion dollar service industry that this country has the
lead in right now?

A recent A. C. Nielson survey found that there are now some 20
million americans now communicating on-line on the Internet.  I
predict that if this draconian dark-ages legislative agenda
you've backed, is forwarded; these millions from cyberspace may
materialize into briberspace--like the million man march--to help
the scoundrels of the PAC's and politicians beholding to the PAC
scoundrels--see the light of the errors of their ways.  And, if
they can't be shown the light, make them feel the heat.

You've offended a great many people with this proposed
legislation, and perhaps gotten some political gain with it--like
so many times before--from the ignorance of the unfortunate.
But, the People will ultimately not allow their communications to
be "dumbed-down" to a happy-face 5th grade level.  They will
fight for their rights to speak and think freely.

The ACLU will immediately challenge your CDA. There is also
promised civil disobedience, in on instance, by a Texas judge to
protest the law.  This law is a cruel joke that will backfire on
Congress.  Please rethink it.

Please work to solve our real problems.  Don't destroy the one
good think this country has.  You won't be able to spin-doctor
this travesty of legislation to your political advantage.

                                            Sincerely yours,


                                            Tom Klemesrud

PS:  You know I run a BBS with over 4,000 voters right in your
congressional district.  Yet, we haven't heard that you have an E-mail
address.  I'll be posting this letter to the public bulletin board
section.
