Subject: File 1--Class Action Notice in CCC BBS lawsuit

Editors -- I would appreciate it if you could include the following
notice in an upcoming edition of CUD.  I believe this lawsuit is the
first of its kind -- a class action brought by users of a 5,500-user
BBS against the government officials who seized it in a pornography
raid on June 16, 1995.  The Judge (at our suggestion) has ordered
that notice be distributed electronically, as there are some 500 plus
non-subscribers whose mail was seized from the BBS Internet gateway.
We have modelled this lawsuit after the Steve Jackson Games lawsuit
which I participated in back in 1993, but expanded it to a class
action on behalf of all users of the system.

I.  INTRODUCTION

1.The Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and the thousands
 of subscribers to the Cincinnati Computer Connection electronic bulletin board
 system, in order to redress the violation of their civil rights by Hamilton
 County Sheriff Simon L. Leis, Jr. and the other Defendants.
2.On June 16, 1995, the Hamilton County Regional Electronic Computer
 Intelligence Task Force (the "Task Force") raided at least five electronic
 bulletin board systems in the Cincinnati area, in a search for allegedly
 obscene materials.
3.During these raids, the Task Force seized the entire computer network
 comprising the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS, a computer bulletin board
 service with thousands of subscribers in Southern Ohio, Northern Kentucky, and
 beyond.  Robert Emerson owns and operates the Cincinnati Computer Connection
 BBS.  The target of the raid was some 45 computer image files allegedly stored
 on the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.  According to the search warrant,
 the Task Force already had obtained copies of these image files from the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
4.In pursuit of these 45 image files,  the Sheriff and Task Force raided and
 seized the entire bulletin board system.  In the process, Sheriff Leis and his
 Task Force seized the private electronic mail and communications of thousands
 of entirely innocent subscribers, they shut down an active, thriving,
 electronic community of average citizens, and they denied thousands of people
 access to their friends, neighbors, and business associates.
5.The named Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and the
 thousands of subscribers to the Cincinnati Computer Connection and all those
 whose electronic communications were seized and intercepted during the raid, in
 order to remedy this violation of their civil rights guaranteed by the First
 Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Ohio
 Constitution, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. '
 2510 et seq. and ' 2701 et seq.), the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act of
 1980 ( 42 U.S.C.  ' 2000aa et seq.), and Ohio common law.


II.  JURISDICTION

6.This action seeks to enforce rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws
 of the United States and is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '' 1983 and 1985.
 Jurisdiction is based upon 28 U.S.C. '' 1331 and 1343(3).  The substantive
 federal claims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  ''1983 and 1985, 18 U.S.C.
 ''2707 and 2520, and 42 U.S.C. ' 2000aa-7.  Declaratory relief is sought
 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ''2201-2202.  Authority to hear the pendent state claims
 is conferred by the Court's supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. '1367.
 This action does not raise novel or complex issues of state law, and the state
 law claims do not predominate over the federal law claims.
7.Venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, under 28
 U.S.C. '1391(b), because at least one Defendant resides in this District and
 Division and because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise
 to the claims occurred within this District and Division.


III.  PARTIES


A.PLAINTIFFS
8.PLAINTIFF STEVEN GUEST is a thirty-two year old resident of Clermont County,
 Ohio.  Mr. Guest is a computer consultant who uses the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection BBS to send and receive electronic communications, to conduct his
 consulting business, to exchange files with his business partners, to access
 shareware, and otherwise to engage in expressive and associational activity.
9.PLAINTIFF DENISE KELLEY is a sixty-nine year old resident of Hamilton County,
 Ohio.  She is employed by the Hamilton County Department of Human Services as
 an investigation coordinator and serves as the chief union steward for AFSCME
 Local 1768.  Mrs. Kelley, mother of three and grandmother of seven, uses the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS for political discussion, to download
 shareware files, to play some games, to send and receive electronic mail
 communications across the Internet, to "chat" with users, to write stories in
 an on-line conference, and otherwise to engage in expressive and associational
 activity.
10.PLAINTIFF BEN S. KELLEY is Mrs. Kelley's husband, a seventy-six year old
 retired machinist who resides in Hamilton County, Ohio.  Mr. Kelley, father of
 three and grandfather of seven, uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to
 send and receive electronic communications, play games, to read the discussions
 going on in various conferences, and otherwise to engage in expressive and
 associational activity.
11.PLAINTIFF NELDA STURGILL is a registered nurse in a local hospital who
 resides in Hamilton County.  In her thirties, Ms. Sturgill uses the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection BBS to send and receive electronic communications across
 the Internet, to access shareware programs, to keep abreast of information
 through the use of the Usenet newsgroups, and otherwise to engage in expressive
 and associational activity.  Ms. Sturgill particularly participates in the
 health-related conferences newsgroups, and has exchanged recipes and ideas with
 people from Australia, England and the United States.
12.PLAINTIFF DEBORAH CUMMINGS is a resident of Kenton County, Kentucky.  Ms.
 Cummings uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and receive
 electronic communications, to conduct her business, and to otherwise engage in
 expressive and associational activity.
13.PLAINTIFF RANDY BOWLING is a resident of Butler County, Ohio.  Mr. Bowling
 suffers from a head injury that makes speaking very difficult.   Mr. Bowling
 uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and receive electronic
 communications, to supplement his limited ability to speak, and to discuss his
 head injury and therapy, and to engage in the majority of his expressive and
 associational activity.  Mr. Bowling also uses the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection BBS to facilitate his current study of computer systems.
14.PLAINTIFF RICHARD KRAMER is a retired insurance agent who resides in Butler
 County, Ohio.  Mr. Kramer, who uses a wheelchair, uses the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection BBS to send and receive electronic communications, to supplement his
 sometimes restricted access to more traditional fora for expressive and
 associational activity, to access file-management and utility shareware, and to
 study computer systems.
15.Each named Plaintiff is a citizen of the United States.
16.At all times relevant herein, Plaintiffs were users of the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection BBS.
Class Action Allegations
17.The named Plaintiffs are proper representatives of a class within the
 meaning of Rule 23(a) and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
18.The members of the class are so numerous that the joinder of all of them is
 impractical.  Upon information and belief, the class consists of at least
 several thousand persons.  The exact size of the class is unknown because the
 Defendants have seized and failed to return the computer and/or documentary
 records needed to determine the exact number and identity of the class members.
19.The members of the class should be readily identifiable from records seized
 by the Defendants.
20.There are questions of law and fact common to the class; their class claims
 predominate over any individual claims.  Each class member shares the same
 federal and state constitutional protections of their right to speak, publish
 and associate.  Each class member shares the same federal and state
 constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  Each
 class member shares the same federal and state rights protecting the privacy of
 their electronic communications and subscriber records.
21.The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class.
 All class members suffered a similar violation of their common rights when the
 Defendants seized and shut down the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS, and,
 upon information and belief, reviewed their private electronic communications
 and subscriber records.  As alleged in greater detail above, the Plaintiffs'
 uses of the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS typify the uses of the class
 members generally.
22.The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
 class.  As of June 16, 1995, each named Plaintiff was a user of the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection BBS.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by counsel
 experienced in litigating federal and state civil rights lawsuits, including
 class actions, and who are familiar with the technology involved and
 experienced in litigating computer communications cases.  The representative
 Plaintiffs know of no conflict of interest among class members.  Plaintiffs
 will vigorously prosecute this action.
23.The class consists of all persons who, on June 16, 1995, were users,
 subscribers, or customers of the Cincinnati Computer Connection electronic
 bulletin board service, and all persons whose private electronic communications
 were resident on the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS when it was seized by
 the Defendants, but not including the actual provider of that electronic
 bulletin board service.
24.Plaintiffs do not propose class notice at this time, but belief that class
 certification and notice can and should be achieved promptly.

IV.  FACTS

A.The Cincinnati Computer Connection Community.
33.On June 16, 1995, and for many years before that, the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection ("CCC") was a thriving community.  The bulletin board system ("BBS")
 provided a forum for its users to speak and publish privately and publicly, to
 debate, to associate and recreate, and to exchange ideas and information.  On
 June 16, 1995, the faces of the CCC subscribers were the faces of Greater
 Cincinnati -- working men and women, retirees, mothers, fathers, grandparents
 and children, Republicans, Democrats and Independents.  The CCC community even
 included subscribers from around the United States and overseas.
34.Many of the subscribers to the CCC BBS have made personal acquaintances
 through the bulletin board community.   Subscribers have held dinner
 get-togethers to meet personally, to socialize, and to discuss matters of
 interest to the BBS community.  These meetings were organized by the
 subscribers by using the BBS itself.
35.On June 16, 1995, the CCC community included thousands of users and
 subscribers.  Because the CCC computers and subscriber records remain in the
 hands of the Defendants, the exact number remains unknown.
36.At all relevant times, the CCC BBS affected and operated in the stream of
 interstate commerce.

B.The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
37.Each user or subscriber to the CCC BBS selected a private password, which
 secured the privacy of his or her account.  The subscriber contacted the CCC
 BBS by using his or her personal computer, a modem, and a phone line.  The
 user's computer would call the CCC BBS over a phone line, and after "logging
 in" by using the confidential password, the user was given access to the CCC
 BBS.  Once connected to the BBS, the subscriber could do a whole range of
 things, including:
i.Private electronic mail or "e-mail."
38.The CCC BBS provided subscribers the ability to send and receive private
 electronic communications, typically known as e-mail.  A subscriber could
 compose private electronic messages either before "logging on" to the CCC, or
 while connected to the bulletin board system.  Just like First Class mail,
 e-mail messages are addressed to a specific person, and are confidential.
39.E-mail was sent and received in two manners on the CCC BBS.  E-mail
 exchanged between persons who had accounts on the CCC BBS was sent within the
 many conference areas on the BBS (see below).  If the sender designated a
 conference message "confidential," the message remained inaccessible to any
 user except the designated recipient.  The CCC BBS also provided an "Internet
 mail gateway."  This feature allowed subscribers to send and receive
 confidential electronic communications from persons who did not have an account
 on the CCC BBS, but who had an Internet address.  This Internet mail gateway
 allowed the users of the CCC BBS to send confidential electronic communications
 to, and receive them from, tens of millions of persons around the world.
40.This e-mail was not readily accessible to the public.  The users of the CCC
 BBS, and those who sent electronic mail to the CCC BBS from the Internet, had a
 reasonable expectation of privacy in those communications.
41.When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the CCC BBS, they seized
 all of the private electronic communications contained on the system, and cut
 off the subscribers' ability to send and receive e-mail.
ii.Conference areas.
42.In addition to e-mail, the Cincinnati Computer Connection provided its
 subscribers access to thousands of "conferences."  These conferences, like the
 sections of a library, are the main organizational units of the BBS.  Each
 conference area had a name and a topic.  For example, the CCC  BBS had
 conference areas dedicated to writers, game players, and computer
 professionals.  When a subscriber accessed the bulletin board system, he or she
 could "enter" an conference area.  Once in a conference area, the subscriber
 could read all the public messages posted by other visitors to the conference,
 post public reply messages or begin new public discussions on new topics.   The
 user could also send and receive private electronic communications within the
 conference.  The CCC BBS provided literally thousands of conferences for its
 users, including:
a.Local conference areas.
43.These conferences were unique to the CCC BBS, and included discussions and
 debates on topics ranging from local and national politics to sports and
 computers.  These conferences were the heart of the local CCC community
 interaction.
b.Private local conference areas.
44.The CCC BBS also provided conference areas that were restricted to
 particular users.  These restricted conference areas were used by subscribers
 for confidential business purposes, including exchanging confidential
 information.
c.BBS network conferences.
45.On June 16, 1995, the CCC BBS also provided to its users "feeds" from
 networks of similar dial-up bulletin board systems.  These networks provided
 dozens of additional conference areas, and allowed the users of the CCC BBS to
 engage in discussion on topics with users of a whole network of BBSs beyond the
 subscribers to the CCC BBS.
d.Usenet newsgroups.
46.The CCC BBS also received, via satellite feed, thousands of additional
 conferences from an Internet network known as Usenet.  Usenet is essentially a
 bulletin board system for the Internet.  Usenet is organized into thousands of
 separate "newsgroups" where people from all around the world can engage in
 discussion and debate on a huge variety of topics, ranging from computer
 science, philosophy, and law to pop music.  The CCC subscribers could read and
 participate in these newsgroups.
47.When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the CCC BBS, they seized
 all of the contents of all of these thousands of conference areas, and denied
 the subscribers to the CCC any access to the conferences.
iii.Live "chat."
48.  The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS also featured live chat "channels."
  Similar to CB radio channels, the "chat" function allowed subscribers to
 converse in "real time" with other subscribers who were logged into the BBS.
 One subscriber could invite another person to chat, and the two subscribers
 could exchange confidential messages by typing them in sequence to each other.
49.When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the CCC BBS, they shut
 down any chat taking place on the board and seized any captured chat file
 sessions.
iv.Games.
50.The game areas on the CCC were very popular.  Subscribers could play a
 variety of on-line games against the computer or against other subscribers.
 Some "games" were more like interactive creative writing, with different users
 of the BBS taking on personas and interacting with each other in a fictional
 world.
51.The Defendants' seizure of the bulletin board system of course included
 seizure of all the games, and cut off the subscribers' access to the games.
v.File transfer.
52.The CCC BBS offered its subscribers the ability to "upload" computer files
 from their home computer to the bulletin board system, and to "download"
 computer files from the bulletin board to their home computers.  Computer files
 can consist of anything from computer programs and other software, to the text
 of written material (such as this Complaint), to picture files and sound files.
  The CCC BBS had an enormous library of computer files for its users to access
 and use.  The Defendants seized this entire library of thousands of computer
 files when they seized the 45 allegedly obscene images they were after.
vi.The restricted adult file area.
53.Among the thousands of conferences on the CCC, there was a single conference
 area dedicated to adult-oriented computer image files.  Access to this area was
 extremely limited.  In order to gain access to this conference, a subscriber
 was required to verify his age and identity in person to the CCC system
 operator, Mr. Emerson.  After verifying the subscriber's age, Emerson would
 configure that user's account to give that subscriber access to the adult file
 area.  Only after a subscriber's age and identity was verified, and the
 subscriber's account given access to the adult file area, would the existence
 of the adult file area even appear on the user's screen when logged in to the
 CCC.  The "menu" of choices available to a subscriber who had not been verified
 and given access would not even show that an adult file area existed.
54.Even for those with access to the restricted adult file area, the adult
 image files could not be viewed "on-line."  In order to view a file, a
 subscriber with access would have to log onto the BBS, enter the restricted
 adult area, designate a file for downloading, download that file to the user's
 home computer, log off the system, and then run a separate computer  program on
 the home computer that interprets the image and displays it on the user's home
 computer screen.
55.The restricted adult file area comprised a very small percentage of the
 material on the CCC BBS -- no more than 3%, and upon information and belief far
 less than that.  The number of users with access to this area was also very
 small -- no more than 3% of the subscribers, and upon information and belief
 far less than that.  Many, if not most, of the CCC subscribers had no idea that
 an adult file area even existed.
56.Compared to the Cincinnati Computer Connection as a whole, the adult file
 area was like a tiny, locked, and largely unknown private room within a huge,
 bustling convention center.
C.Defendants Obtain A Search Warrant And Go Trolling for Computer Porn.
57.On or about June 15, 1995, the Defendants applied to the Municipal Court of
 Clermont Count for a search warrant for the premises containing the CCC BBS
 computers.  Municipal Court Judge James A. Shriver signed the search warrant at
 11:30 p.m. that evening.  Upon information and belief, Judge Shriver had never
 reviewed an application for the search or for the seizure of an electronic
 communication system such as the CCC BBS, and had never issued a search warrant
 for such a system.  The search warrant itself listed 45 particular image files,
 by name and description, that were the target of the search.
58.The Defendants obtained an order sealing from public scrutiny the search
 warrant affidavit that allegedly justified their application for the search
 warrant.   Plaintiffs have now obtained a copy of the single affidavit that was
 used to support the application for search warrant.
59.The warrant filed in support of the application for search warrant was
 signed by David L. Ausdenmoore.  The affidavit was false and/or misleading in
 at least the following respects:
a)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the CCC BBS was a forum for
 speech, publication and associated protected by the Privacy Protection Act of
 1980, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the Ohio
 Constitution;
b)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the Defendants intended to
 shut down that protected forum, and seize all the publications on that forum;
c)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the CCC BBS contained
 thousands of private electronic communications to and from the subscribers of
 the CCC BBS protected from unauthorized interception, seizure and disclosure by
 the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986;
d)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the Defendants intended to
 shut down this protected electronic communications system;
e)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the Defendants intended to
 seize, intercept and read these protected, private communications;
f)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the Defendants had no
 probable cause to believe that these private communications were relevant to
 the investigation of any criminal activity, let alone the criminal activity
 alleged in the Affidavit;
g)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that the Defendants had no
 probable cause to believe that the public communications contained on the
 system of the Plaintiffs were related to any criminal activity, let alone the
 criminal activity alleged in the Affidavit;
h)The affidavit failed to inform Judge Shriver that far less intrusive means of
 searching for the allegedly offending material were readily available to the
 Defendants, means that would not have involved the seizure of either the
 private electronic messages of the Plaintiffs or their publicly posted
 messages;
i)The affidavit falsely stated and/or implied that the allegedly obscene
 material on the CCC BBS was "concealed in violation of law," when, according to
 the Affidavit itself, the Defendants had already obtained copies of the images
 by accessing the CCC BBS themselves; and
j)The affidavit falsely stated that the images sought to be seized by the
 Defendants were downloaded from the CCC BBS "as a regular user of the BBS,"
 falsely implying that all users of the BBS had access to these images, rather
 than a very small number of users.
D.Defendants Shut Down the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS and
 Indiscriminately Seize Everything On It.
60.On June 16, 1995, purportedly acting under the authority of the search
 warrant signed by Judge Shriver, the Defendants seized the entire CCC BBS.  The
 Defendants made no effort to limit their seizure to materials or information
 related to the alleged offense under investigation; rather, they seized the
 entire system, shutting it down completely.  If not for a significant personal
 financial commitment by Mr. Emerson after the raid, the CCC BBS would have been
 permanently shut down.
61.The Defendants made no effort to return to the Plaintiffs or any other user
 of the CCC BBS their private electronic communications, or to assure that such
 communications reach their intended recipients.  Upon information and belief,
 the Defendants have already, or have every intention to, read the private
 electronic communications of the CCC BBS subscribers.
62.The Defendants made no effort to limit the scope of their seizure.  Prior to
 the raid, the Defendants knew the exact file names of the computer image files
 they were searching for.  In fact, the Defendants had already obtained those
 files prior to the raid.  The Defendants consciously chose not to use means at
 their disposal that would have allowed for a limited search and seizure of
 evidence relevant to the alleged offense.  The Defendants consciously refused
 to use narrower means of obtaining their investigative objectives that would
 have protected the privacy of the subscribers' communications and the integrity
 of their forum.
63.The Defendants knew, or should have known, that the CCC BBS was a forum for
 protected speech, publication and communication.  The Defendants knew, or
 should have known, that the CCC BBS contained materials being published
 electronically that were protected by the First Amendment to the U.S.
 Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, and the Privacy Protection Act.  The
 Defendants knew, or should have known, that the  BBS contained the private
 electronic communications of its users, and that such communications were not
 readily accessible to the public.  The Defendants knew, or should have known,
 that the users of the CCC BBS had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their
 electronic communications.
64.Reasonable law enforcement officers in the position of the Defendants, with
 the information available to the Defendants, would have known that the CCC BBS
 was a forum for speech, publication and communication protected by the First
 Amendment and the Ohio Constitution, and that the electronic communications on
 the CCC BBS were protected by the Fourth Amendment, the Ohio Constitution and
 federal statutory law from search and seizure and interception unless the
 officers had probable cause to believe that those communications were relevant
 to the law enforcement inquiry.
65.The raid on the home of Bob Emerson, the seizure of the entire CCC BBS
 system, and the examination and review of the contents of that system, were
 conducted under the direction of Defendant Leis, who is the policymaker for the
 Hamilton County Sheriff's Department, and/or pursuant to a policy or custom
 authorized, permitted and tolerated by Defendants Leis, Hamilton County
 Sheriff's Department, and the Task Force to, among other things:
a)indiscriminately seize and shut down entire electronic bulletin board systems
 without legal authority or probable cause;
b)seize and intercept public and private electronic communications and other
 private information of persons without legal authorization or probable cause;
c)deny innocent persons access to their public and private electronic
 communications, without legal authorization or probable cause;
d)apply for and obtain search warrants purportedly authorizing the seizure of
 computers, without informing the issuing magistrate or judge that the computer
 system operates an electronic communication system, contains public and private
 communications unrelated to the investigation, and that seizure of the system
 will result in the seizure and interception of electronic communications and
 the complete shutting down of an electronic communication system;
e)apply for and obtain search warrants purportedly authorizing the seizure of
 computers operating electronic communications systems, without informing the
 issuing magistrate or judge that the computers contain communications protected
 by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Privacy Protection Act of
 1980, the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and
 Ohio statutory and constitutional law;
f)exceed the authorization of search warrants in the seizure and examination of
 seized BBSs;
g)seize and examine BBSs and computer systems in order to search for evidence
 of suspected crimes without legal authorization or probable cause;
h)conduct searches and seizures outside the territorial jurisdiction of
 Hamilton County without legal authority;
i)seize and shut down BBSs in order to prevent further publication and
 distribution of materials presumptively protected by the federal and state
 constitutions, without any adversarial determination of the legality of such
 materials; and
j)knowingly fail and refuse to conduct investigations into suspected computer
 crimes without intercepting, seizing, or denying access to, the private and
 public communications and private information of innocent citizens.
66.The Class Members' injuries and deprivation of constitutional, statutory and
 common law rights were proximately caused by Defendants Leis, Hamilton County
 Sheriff's Department, and the Task Force's failure to adequately train their
 officers in the proper manner of conducting investigations of alleged computer
 crime, so that such investigations would be made without the violation of
 innocent persons' rights, and such failure to train amounted to a deliberate
 indifference to the Class Members' constitutional, statutory and common law
 rights.
