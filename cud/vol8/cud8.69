Subject: File 1--Poulsen Stifled by No-computers Probation Rule

             POULSEN STIFLED BY NO-COMPUTERS PROBATION RULE

Published: Sept. 23, 1996

BY BRANDON BAILEY
Mercury News Staff Writer

Convicted hacker Kevin Poulsen is out of prison after five years,
but he still can't touch a computer.

Facing a court order to pay more than $57,000 in restitution for
rigging a series of radio station call-in contests, Poulsen has
complained that authorities won't let him use his only marketable
skill -- programming.

Instead, Poulsen said, he's doomed to work for minimum wage at a
low-tech job for the next three years. Since his June release from
prison -- after serving more time in jail than any other U.S.
hacker -- the only work he's found is canvassing door-to-door for
a liberal political action group.

                     .......................

Poulsen now lives with his sister in the Los Angeles area, where
he grew up in the 1970s and '80s. But he must remain under
official supervision for three more years. And it galls him that
authorities won't trust him with a keyboard or a mouse.

U.S. District Judge Manuel Real has forbidden Poulsen to have any
access to a computer without his probation officer's approval.

That's a crippling restriction in a society so reliant on computer
technology, Poulsen complained in a telephone interview, after a
hearing last week during which the judge denied Poulsen's request
to modify his terms of probation.

To comply with those rules, Poulsen said, his parents had to put
their home computer in storage when he stayed with them. He can't
use an electronic card catalog at the public library. And he
relies on friends to maintain his World Wide Web site. He even
asked his probation officer if it was OK to drive because most
cars contain microchips.

                   ...........................

Legal experts say there's a precedent for restricting a hacker's
access to computers, just as paroled felons may be ordered not to
possess burglary tools or firearms. Still, some say it's going too
far.

"There are so many benign things one can do with a computer,"
said Charles Marson, a former attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union who handles high-tech cases in private practice.
"If it were a typewriter and he pulled some scam with it or wrote
a threatening note, would you condition his probation on not using
a typewriter?"

                         ................

According to Schindler, the probation office now will consider
Poulsen's requests to use computers "on a case by case basis."

In Article 5, Volume 8, Issue #66 of the Computer underground Digest,
David Smith <bladex@bga.com> raised an issue about potentially
misleading references to user preferences in our press announcement for
Internet Explorer 3.0
(http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/1996/aug96/1MILLPR.htm). The
press release stated that "four out of five users prefer Microsoft
Internet Explorer to Netscape Navigator." It should have stated that
"four out of five new Web users prefer Microsoft Internet Explorer to
Netscape Navigator."  We appreciate David pointing out the discrepancy
and are revising such references to the study results.

It is true that the subjects of the study
(http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie3/usability.htm) did not have any prior
Web browser experience. As the study indicates:

"The users had basic Windows 95 experience and understood Windows 95
concepts. All the users were individuals that had a strong interest in
learning about and using the Internet but no prior experience with a web
browser or the Internet. Users were not told who commissioned the study,
and they were screened to ensure that they were not prejudiced toward
either Microsoft or Netscape as a company."

We felt that this was an appropriate way to conduct the survey. It
provided an unbiased view of the browser product without the bias of
prior use, experience, or existing preference. It would have been
difficult to remove these biases if the study subjects had already been
using a given browser (e.g. Navigator) for any length of time.

As a test of first-time users, which the survey itself indicates, the
results are solid. We regret any confusion that may have been caused by
not indicating that the study was of new users in the August 19, 1996
Press Release. While it is too late for us to edit the Press Release, we
are modifying any other references to the study results on our Web site
to read ..."four out of five new Web users prefer Microsoft Internet
Explorer to Netscape Navigator."

Although the study results are valid for new users, we have been
receiving strong evidence that experienced users also like Internet
Explorer 3.0. (http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie3/readeu.htm)
Additionally, we have done extremely well in head-to-head comparisons by
the press with Navigator 3.0. (http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie3/read.htm)

We appreciate this opportunity to clear up any confusion on what we
genuinely feel to be an excellent product - Internet Explorer 3.0. We
welcome any comments (http://www.microsoft.com/ie/support/feedback/),
you have on our product and trust me - they get read!

INTRODUCTION

This is a busy last few days for Washington.  In the midst of it all,
the Judiciary committee held a hearing HR 3011, beginning the process of
educating Congress for next year, and bringing in the Administration for
a regular public drubbing about their antiquated encryption regulations.

The very same day, WWW.Crypto.Com was honored to have Netscape CEO Jim
Barksdale sign onto petition that supports legislation that would:

	-Relax export controls on encryption technology;
	-Prohibit the government from imposing "Key Escrow" solutions
	 domestically; and
	-Recognize the importance of privacy and security for the future
	 of electronic commerce, individual liberty, and the success of the
	 Internet.

Jim Barksdale is no stranger to the encryption debate.  He testified
at the July 25th hearing on the pro-encryption Pro-CODE bill (S1726).
You can hear him in his own words by listening to the RealAudio transcript
of the hearing cybercast at http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/

We'll be continuing the petition throughout the break and the election
and use it next year to support the encryption legislation that will
surely be introduced again.

Be a part of it by signing the petition with Jim Barksdale at
http://www.crypto.com/petition/  !

 ------------------------------------------------------
JOIN NETSCAPE CEO JIM BARKSDALE IN FIGHTING FOR YOUR PRIVACY!

The following petition can be signed onto at http://www.crypto.com/petition/

	The Information Revolution is being held hostage by an
	outdated, Cold War-era U.S. encryption policy.

	Current U.S. export controls and other initiatives are slowing
	the widespread availability of strong encryption products,
	endangering the privacy and security of electronic
	communications, harming the competitiveness of U.S. businesses,
	and threatening the future of electronic commerce and the
	growth of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII).

	We the undersigned Internet users and concerned citizens
	strongly support Congressional efforts to address this critical
	issue. Bills are currently pending in both Houses of Congress
	which would:

	-Relax export controls on encryption technology;
	-Prohibit the government from imposing "Key Escrow" solutions
	 domestically; and
	-Recognize the importance of privacy and security for the future of
	 electronic commerce, individual liberty, and the success of the
	 Internet.

	We urge Congress to act NOW to enact a U.S. encryption policy that
	promotes electronic privacy and security.

Subject: File 4--Banned Books Week 9/28-10/5

Just a reminder:

Banned Books Week is co-sponsored
by the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, the
American Library Association, the Association of American
Publishers, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and the
National Association of College Stores. As in the past, Banned Books
Week is also endorsed by the Center for the Book of the Library of
Congress.

The battle against those who would remove materials from libraries,
schools, and bookstores-- and now, the Internet-- continues, and in
many areas has escalated. Through the participation of thousands of
bookstores and libraries across the country, millions of Americans
learn about the critical importance of free expression and of the
perilous threats to First Amendment rights that exist in our country
today. Banned Books Week draws attention to the danger that exits
when restraints are imposed on the availability of information in a
free society. The message goes beyond the freedom to choose and to
express ones opinion; the message of Banned Books Week is the
importance of ensuring the availability of viewpoints, even
unorthodox or unpopular, to those who wish to read them.

A large listing of banned books and their circumstances, along with
additional links will be going up on http://www.bb.com shortly.

Subject: File 5--Computer Virus Hysteria/John McAfee Awards: plea for books

Crypt Newsletter and Computer Virus Myths guru Rob Rosenberger
have put their heads together to comb the media for
computer virus stories that have contributed the most to
computer virus misinformation and confusion in 1996.  Once they've
been compiled, we'll put them on display along with analyses of their
impact and faults and throw the nominees open to Netizens for their
votes on which are the best, or worst, depending on your point
of view.

Rob has puckishly named the contest the 1996 John McAfee Awards
after the 1992 watershed event of Michelangelo hype that catapulted
the anti-virus software developer to fame and fortune -- his
former company to a dominant position in the anti-virus industry.

But we want this to be an exercise in extending computer literacy
and to that end we intend to give away some prizes -- namely books!
Here's where you -- authors, publishers, the pure of heart and
philanthropic -- come in. Contribute one book on computer security,
computer viruses or reality and culture in cyberspace and we'll be
forever in your debt. You'll get publicity when we mention your
philanthropy and book during the nominations, voting and awards
ceremony.  Plus you'll have the satisfaction of knowing your book
is going to be placed directly into the hands of someone in the media
who needs it the most!

To contribute a book, contact me or Rob Rosenberger.

Rob Rosenberger: us@kumite.com

In late October we'll publicize the nominees and the prizes so the
voting can begin.  Watch this space for further details.

Subject: File 6--Jean_bernard_Condat PhD Musicologie

((MODERATORS' NOTE: Monday, CuD received a call from Mr.
Tariq Krim, who is currently working in the Silicon Valley.
Mr. Krim was upset with the following passage from CuD 8.67, File 5:

     Yesterday, I lost my job of senior consultant in the Smart
     Card Business Unit of Informix because  Mr. Tariq Krim of
     the ENST in Paris don't hesitate to call all my chiefs with
     some kind words on my life.

It appears that the above passage is less than accurate.

And, while CuD cannot always identify forged messages, we do
feel compelled to observe that the original post that Crypt
Newsletter editor George Smith identified as plagiarized from
him isn't normally the kind of forgeries that are sent, and
the plagiarized post was consistent with similar posts from
the same source that we published without complaint.

Below is Mr. Krim's response to the allegation that he called
"all my chiefs" that resulted in dismissal:

                       -------------

Usually when I hear about Jean Bernard Condat we tell me bad things. I've
heard that he claimed to be a computer hacker and specialist of
telecommunications.

A few years ago someone gave Condat a phone number and said "hack my
machine if you can". Jean Bernard Condat spent 15 days trying.
It was a Fax number ...

Now he claims to be on the Internet since 81. Hopefully for the net he's
around for a few years only  and is forbidden on all the french BBS and
french ISP.

Now I've never seen Mister Condat personnaly. I don't want to keep contact
with this person. I've just written this mail to tell all my friends and
the CuD readers that the story he told is completely false.

First: I don't know Condat.
second: I don't know the people of Informix France.
three: I don't know where he had my email
four: Your are responsible for what you say on the Internet and lying is not
a good thing as copying articles and books.
five: defamation has legal issues that I could exploit if this story is
not finished after this mail.
six: be polite on phone and don't tell another story than the one
published in CuD because it decreases your credibility ( if you still have
some)

And for the last time Jean Bernard Condat is a true Space "blaireau".

Well all this to say that I don't have yet the power to fire people in a
second, even people like JBC. I dont follow this guy 's life and
technically what he said is impossible as I live in the US. (hey you
didn't know that Mr Condat)

I don't want to be better than Jean Bernard Condat, I dont want to be Jean
Bernard Condat, and I dont want my name associate to this guy.
never ever....

Any way Jim I want to tell you that this e-zine that I read for soon 6
years is still the reference for underground computers issues.

(1) FBI Demands for Broad New Surveillance Power Rejected on Privacy
    Grounds

A telecommunications industry standards body on Thursday voted to reject a
demand by the FBI to create a national tracking system out of the wireless
telephone network.  CDT applauds this decision as a significant victory
for privacy and condemns the FBI's blatant efforts to subvert the specific
requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA, also known as "Digital Telephony").

"The FBI is demanding that every cell phone double as a tracking device,
providing instant and continuous location information not just when a
subject is talking but whenever a cellular phone is turned on. " said CDT
Executive Director Jerry Berman. "The FBI is demanding real-time tracking
of anyone suspected of committing a crime.  This is a clear violation of
the statute and the Fourth Amendment." Berman added

At issue are technical standards currently being drafted to implement the
1994 law. The FBI, which holds an influential position within the industry
standards process, has demanded that the wireless telephone network be
designed in a way that would allow real time tracking of individuals
suspected of a crime.

Specifically, the FBI is demanding that wireless networks be designed to
facilitate:

* Tracking of the physical location of a subject any time a cellular
  phone is turned on (even if no call is being made or received)

* Tracking of the physical location of a subject when a cellular phone
  moves within a service area or moves to another carrier's service area

* Tracking of the physical location of a subject when a cellular phone
  makes or receives a call

* Delivery of this information to law enforcement in real time (within
  500 milliseconds)

Although law enforcement currently has the authority to obtain certain
location information through a search warrant, the standards proposed by
the FBI would have allowed access to far more detailed location information
under a lower standard.

"The law was designed to freeze the FBI in time, not as a blank check to
the FBI to design the telecommunications network any way it pleased."
Berman said. "The FBI's demands go far beyond what's permitted under CALEA
and contradict statements by Director Freeh before Congress 2 years ago."

The drafters of CALEA specifically stated that the statute was not designed
to expand law enforcement surveillance authority. The Committee report on
the legislation notes:

 "The FBI director testified that the legislation was intended to
  preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law
  enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in
  the past. The Committee urges against over broad interpretation of the
  requirements."
   -- House Judiciary Committee Report to Accompany H.R. 4922. Rept.
      103-827 Part 1, Page 22

NEXT STEPS

In order to ensure public oversight and accountability over the FBI's
surveillance authority, CALEA requires the government to reimburse the
telecommunications industry for the costs of meeting the statute's
requirements.  Congress is currently considering a mechanism to fund the
implementation of the law.

CDT urges the Congress to exercise its oversight role to determine whether
the FBI is seeking to use CALEA to expand current surveillance capabilities
contrary to the specific intent of the law.  Unless and until the FBI
clarifies its intent and justifies its demands, Congress should not allow
the expenditure of any funds to implement CALEA.

CDT and a ad-hoc task force of other privacy organizations and
telecommunications industry representatives are currently conducting a
review of electronic surveillance issues at the request of Senators Patrick
Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA).  The task force report will cover the
implementation of CALEA and will be released within the next few months.
CDT stands ready to intervene again at the standards setting process and
before the FCC if necessary in order to ensure that privacy is protected as
CALEA is implemented.

public interest organization focusing on free speech and privacy issues in
new computer and communications technology.  CDT can be found on the World
Wide Web at:  http://www.cdt.org/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) CDT BACKGROUND MEMO ON THE FBI DEMANDS

FBI SEEKS TO USE CELLULAR TELEPHONES AS TRACKING DEVICES

The FBI is demanding the telecommunications industry design cellular
telephone networks in a way which would allow law enforcement to track
the physical location and movements of individuals in clear violation of
the law.  This effort by the FBI raises grave privacy concerns and must
be rejected by the telecommunications industry.

In ongoing discussions with a Telecommunications Industry Association
committee established to set technical standards to implement the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, P.L. 103-414,
also known as the "Digital Telephony" statute), the FBI is requesting
surveillance capability far beyond current law enforcement capabilities and
in clear violation of the scope of the law.

CALEA was not designed as a blank check from Congress allowing law
enforcement to design the telecommunications network to expand existing
surveillance capability. Rather, the statute was carefully balanced to
ensure that law enforcement maintain the status quo. This overreaching by
the FBI raises serious privacy concerns and clearly violates the balance
struck by CALEA.  CDT strongly urges Congress to refrain from approving any
funding for the implementation of CALEA until the FBI makes its intentions
clear.

FBI Demanding Location Information In Clear Violation of the Statute

The FBI's request is contained in a proposal called the Electronic
Surveillance Interface (ESI), which specifies the design of the interface
between the telecommunications network and law enforcement's own
surveillance equipment. The FBI has refused a formal request by CDT to view
a copy of the ESI.

However, documents obtained from a meeting of the FBI and the
telecommunications industry on September 12 indicate that the FBI is
demanding that cellular networks be designed to deliver location
information to law enforcement.  Specifically,  the ESI states that
cellular networks must be designed to provide the geographic location of a
particular subject:

The ESI states:

  R7-62     The SSM (Surveillance Status Message) shall be delivered to
            the LEA (Law Enforcement Authority) whenever the subject
            changes location or between systems and this location is
            available to the IAP (Intercept Access Point)

In short, the FBI is requesting that the cellular network be designed to
report the geographic location of an individual subject:

1. When a cellular phone is turned on (even if no call is made)
2. When a cellular phone moves within a service area or moves to another
   carrier's service area.
3. When a cellular phone makes or receives a call.

The FBI claims that location information has to be provided to law
enforcement under CALEA because it is part of  "call setup information."
However, in his testimony before a joint hearing of the House and Senate
Judiciary Committees on March 18, 1994, FBI Freeh director stated exactly
the opposite:

 "Several privacy-based spokespersons have criticized the wording of the
  definition (of call setup information)... alleging that the government
  is seeking a new, pervasive, automated 'tracking' capability. Such
  allegations are completely wrong.... In order to make clear that the
  acquisition of such information is not... included within the term
  'call setup information' we are prepared to add a concluding phrase to
  this definition to explicitly clarify the point: '*** except that such
  information [call setup information] shall not include any information
  that may disclose the physical location of a mobile facility or
  service beyond that associated with the number's area code or
  exchange.'"    (Testimony of FBI director Louis Freeh before a joint
  hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and
  Constitutional Rights and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on
  Technology and the Law, March 18, 1994. S. Hrg 103-1022).

The drafters of CALEA noted in the Committee report that the statute was not
designed to expand law enforcement surveillance ability:

 "The FBI director testified that the legislation was intended to
  preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law
  enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in
  the past.  The Committee urges against over broad interpretation of
  the requirements." (House Judiciary Committee Report to Accompany H.R.
  4922. Rept. 103-827 Part 1, page 22)

The FBI's demand that all wireless communications equipment provide the
physical locations of a subscriber at all times goes raises obvious privacy
issues and goes well beyond the scope of CALEA and the explicit statements
of the FBI.

No Funds Should Be Appropriated to Implement CALEA Until This Issue is Resolved

In passing CALEA, Congress sought to preserve law enforcement's ability to
conduct electronic surveillance as new communications technologies are
developed.  At the same time, Congress was very clear that the law was
designed to preserve the status quo and not to expand law enforcement
surveillance authority.  In addition, Congress took the extra step of
including substantial Congressional oversight and public accountability to
the implementation process in order to ensure that law enforcement did not
overreach and that privacy interests would be protected.

The law requires the telecommunications industry to set standards for
meeting the FBI's general requirements in an open process, allows
interested parties to challenge any standard before the FCC if it fails to
protect privacy, and requires Congressional oversight and accountability
over the implementation of the law by mandating government reimbursement
for expensive capability upgrades.

We urge Congress to exercise its oversight role to determine whether in
fact the FBI is seeking to use CALEA to expand its current surveillance
capabilities contrary to the intent of the law.  Unless and until the FBI
clarifies its intent and justifies its demands, Congress should not allow
the expenditure of any funds to implement CALEA.

We look forward to discussing this issue with you further.  If you have any
