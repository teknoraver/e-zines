                           InfoWarCon 5, 1996
            Electronic Civil Defense for the 21st. Century
 The Convergence of the Commercial and the Military Sectors:
              Vulnerabilities, Capabilities and Solutions
                          September 5-6, 1996
                            Washington, DC

 Historically, civil defense has meant to protect citizenry against hostile
military actions. Today, with the specter of Information Warfare representing
new challenges to late-industrial and information age nation-states, the rules
have radically changed. Societies are rapidly migrating to increased dependance
upon four critical interrelated infrastructures and adequate methods of
protection must be developed:

 	- The Power grid is the basis of most of modern society. With it gone,
not much else happens.  If you think this is just a matter of building more
generators, think again--what happens if the factories that *make* the
generators are taken down, too?

 	- The Communications infrastructure: land, sea, air and satellite. 95%
of
military communications go over the public networks, and 100% of all financial
and industrial communications. Is it worth protecting?

 	- The Global Financial structure depends upon the first two
infrastructures, and is perhaps the most vulnerable to theft and denial of
service attack.  99+% of all "wealth" is digital--what happens if it vaporizes?

 	- Transportation systems rely upon the other three. The air traffic
systems require both power and communications to manage the thousands of
airplanes in the sky.  What happens to the thousands of airplanes in the air
if air traffic control across an entire country goes down?

 Without all of these infrastructures properly and reliably functioning, the
private sector and the national security community cannot function. No heat, no
air conditioning, no food distribution, no light, no radio or TV, no Internet.
Are we prepared?  Do we have a a crisis response for the day money as we  know
it vanishes?

 Electronic Civil Defense will soon become a critical component of any nation's
well being while the needs of both the private sector and government converge.
The convergence of military and civilian interests that Mr. Schwartau predicted
two years ago is happening before our eyes. Defensive and commercial postures
have so intertwined as to make them indistinguishable.

 This Fifth International Conference on Information Warfare is an unclassified,
open source forum, and will examine the myriad questions of Electronic Civil
Defense from the US, International and multi-cultural perspectives.

 Our seasoned experts will work with InfoWarCon5 delegates to outline a
framework for the vulnerabilities, threats, risks and solutions for Electronic
Civil Defense.  From this conference participants will be able to draw critical
insights which will improve their own legislative, regulatory, financial, and
operational readiness and security.  Last year's Washington InfoWarCon brought
together over 600 people and was covered by CNN among other major media
organizations. This year key world players in information warfare from the
economic, military, and law enforcement communities of over 30 countries are
expected to participate.    Be prepared for highly interactive sessions with
plenty of audience participation.  Please bring  your opinions and be ready to
discuss them with us all!

 	but a predicted 200 civilian collateral fatalities within 30 days.
 	What do you do? The Ethical conundra of Information Warfare will
 	be examined from all perspectives.  Or: you have been attacked

Services,
					BankAmerica

					Preparedness, Bellcore

 	Experts from the major civilian infrastructures will discuss how
 	past cooperation between industry and government has echoed
 	economic realities. The bulk of the nations information
 	infrastructure is not under the economic or regulatory control of the
 	Federal government. So, how do we maintain a healthy balance
 	between private initiative and legislative and regulatory
 	actions? Today there is no "due diligence" standard which
	requires that communications and computing services be guaranteed
	in terms of security and data integrity.  Our panel will provoke
	an active discussion of remedial cooperative measures.

 	D4	"Understanding and Defending Against Industrial Espionage and 	
			Information Terrorism."
			Tom Fedorek, Managing Director, Kroll Associates New
York*
			Matt DeVost TITLE COMING

 	A look at how modern espionage and information is conducted, why it's
done and
 	who's doing it.  How much can it cost your company and how can you
 	tell if you're targeted? Do not miss this fascinating session
	which is expected to feature the Kroll Managing Directors
	from Paris, London, and New York.

 16:15 - 16:30	Break

 16:30 - 17:00		Wrap Up: "What is War?"

Subject: File 3--Time/Warner Merger; "Orchid Club/Porno"; Intel/MS (Noah/news)

FTC OKAYS TIME WARNER MERGER WITH TURNER
The Federal Trade Commission has indicated it will approve Time
Warner's $7.5 billion purchase of the Turner Broadcasting System,
which will create the world's largest media and entertainment
conglomerate.  The final settlement apparently will limit the
financial interest that John Malone's Tele-Communications Inc.
(TCI) can take in Time Warner, severely reduce various
concessions that would have been made to TCI, and would forbid
Time Warner from discriminating against competitors in the cable
industry.  (Washington Post 18 Jul 96)

"ORCHID CLUB" INDICTMENTS FOR PORNOGRAPHY ON INTERNET
A federal grand jury in San Jose, California, has indicted 16 people
from the U.S. and abroad for their participation in a child
pornography ring called the "Orchid Club," whose members used the
Internet to share sexual pictures and conduct online chat during a
child molestation.  A U.S. attorney says there are no free speech
issues involved:  "The thing that ups the ante in this case is that
allegations of distribution of pornography are coupled with serious
allegations of child molestation.  It's an issue relating to the
protection of children, not to the First Amendment."  (New York
Times 17 Jul 96 A8)

INTEL, MICROSOFT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT
Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have agreed to cross-license their
Internet communications technology in an effort to pursue
Internet-based telephone and videoconferencing business
opportunities.  The alliance, which will exploit Intel's Proshare
videoconferencing technology and Microsoft's NetMeeting and ActiveX
software, will also develop technology to allow users to find other
people to talk with on the Internet via a User Location Service.

Subject: File 4--Microsoft sues IRS; AOL goes AWOL (news from Noah)

MICROSOFT SUES IRS FOR EXPORT TAX BENEFITS
Microsoft has filed a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue
Service, in an effort to recoup about $19 million paid as part of
the company's 1990 and 1991 tax returns.  The legal action ups
the ante in the software industry's bid for favorable treatment
under a 1984 law that allows businesses to set up foreign sales
corporations, thereby exempting 15% of their export income from
U.S. taxes.  Similar industries, including exporters of films,
tapes and records, have benefited from the 1984 provision.  The
software industry has said it would save about $200 million over
five years if it were allowed the same protections.  (Wall Street
Journal 8 Aug 96 B4)

AOL GOES AWOL
America Online went off-line yesterday, stranding more than 6
million subscribers in the real world of snail mail and
"sneakernet," as one consultant who depends on e-mail described
it.  The AOL computers were shut down at 4:00 a.m. for routine
maintenance, and then were unable to resume function at the
scheduled 7:00 a.m. power-up.  While some people took the outage
with a dose of philosophy, others predicted this event was the
harbinger of more trouble in cyberspace.  "Clearly the
longer-term goal has to be for the Internet to become more like
the phone system is today," in terms of reliability, says a
director for AT&T's WorldNet service.  "The likely scenario is
