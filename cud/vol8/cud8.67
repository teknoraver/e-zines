Concern at attacks by hackers on Internet sites

Wednesday September 18 1996

By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco

   A rash of hacker attacks on commercial Internet sites - including one
   in which the services of Panix, a New York-based Internet access
   provider, were seriously disrupted - has raised new concerns about the
   security and reliability of the worldwide computer network.

   In these "denial of service" attacks, hackers have flooded Internet
   sites with false requests for information sent from fake addresses,
   tying up the computers and preventing access by legitimate users.

   In addition to the Panix attack, at least one large information
   technology company, which declined to be identified, has suffered a
   similar attack.

   Attacks have been "isolated incidents", said Mr Pete Solvik,
   vice-president of information systems at Cisco Systems, the leading
   manufacturer of routing equipment for the Internet. The company,
   however, is concerned that the problem could spread, disrupting
   Internet service for millions of users and effectively closing down
   large commercial sites on the Internet.

   With many banks and retailers now planning Internet services, the
   potential for financial losses as a result of such attacks is rising.
   Disruption of Internet service can also be a serious problem for the
   tens of thousands of businesses that now rely on electronic mail and
   sites on the World Wide Web to communicate with their partners and

[...]

   The Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York Computer Investigations
   Threat Assessment Center is understood to be investigating the attack
   on Panix. Computer Emergency Response Teams, a US organisation that
   collates information about security and technical problems on the
   Internet, are looking into the incident.

BBC to enter Internet market

Thursday September 19 1996

By Alan Cane and Raymond Snoddy in London

   The BBC plans to launch a service on the Internet which could promote
   greater acceptance of the global computer network in the same way that
   the BBC Computer popularised computing in the 1980s.

   Contracts have been signed between BBC Worldwide, the public
   broadcaster's commercial arm, and the multimedia division of ICL, the
   UK computer group owned by Fujitsu of Japan, to design and run the
   service.

   BBC Worldwide will announce the service within the next two weeks. It
   will feature news, weather and travel information as well as
   educational and entertainment material. It is expected to go live in
   the early part of 1997.

[...]

   The main selling points will be speed - compared with the frequent
   delays experienced by users - and ease of use. There will also be a
   "morality button" to reassure parents who might fear their children
   could use the service to view pornography and other unsuitable
   material available on the Internet.

   ICL declined to comment last night.

                   HACKERS VANDALIZE CIA HOME PAGE

  No security breach of private files, agency says

     September 19, 1996
     Web posted at: 10:00 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT)

     By Wayne B. Drash and Jim B. Morris

     ATLANTA (CNN) -- Hackers broke into the CIA's World Wide Web home
     page (http://www.odci.gov/cia/) Thursday morning, altered it, added
     obscenities and changed the agency's name on the page to the
     "Central Stupidity Agency."

     The CIA, which took down the site shortly after 7:30 a.m. EDT, said
     the hackers did not gain access to the agency's private files. "This
     (the publicly available CIA Web site) is on an entirely different
     circuit from everyone else at the CIA," agency spokesman Rick Oborn

     He said the CIA did not know who was responsible for the hacking or
     when the page would be restored. "A team is being pulled together to
     assess how many layers (of the site) were affected and how we can
     get it back on line," Oborn said.

  Anonymous call

     An anonymous phone caller tipped CNN Interactive to the break-in,
     saying Swedish hackers were responsible.

     The phone call was received about 5:45 a.m. EDT. When asked what the
     hackers had done to the page, the man said, "I think you should just
     take a look at it."

     He then hung up without further comment. He did not leave his name
     or identify a specific group.

Here's the real info on the Lexis thing:


This statement was issued today:
--------
STATEMENT FROM LEXIS-NEXIS   9/18/96

Incorrect information is being distributed on Internet newsgroups regarding
the data displayed in LEXIS-NEXIS' P-TRAK file.  P-TRAK is like an
electronic "white pages."  The only information displayed is the name of the
individual, current address and up to two previous addresses and telephone
number.  In some cases, the individual's maiden name may appear and as well
as the month and year of birth.  That is the ONLY information displayed in
the P-TRAK file.

Contrary to some messages that have been posted to some Internet discussion
and news groups, the P-TRAK file DOES NOT contain any credit histories, bank
account information, personal financial data, mother's maiden name or
medical histories.  This misinformation has been posted over and over again
to various news groups.

An example of a record appears below:

Name:  DOE, JOHN E
Current Address:  1066 Anywhere Drive, Dayton, OH  95454
Previous Address:  106 Somewhere Drive, Dayton, OH  92454
Birthdate:  9/1965
Telephone Number:  555-1212
On File Since:  6/1/1994

The information displayed in the P-TRAK file is the type of information
readily available from public information sources such as telephone
directories (in print and CD-ROM format) and public records maintained by
government agencies.

LEXIS-NEXIS markets the P-TRAK file to the legal community for use by
general legal practitioners, litigators and public attorneys, as well as law
enforcement agencies and police departments.  These professionals use the
P-TRAK file to assist in locating litigants, witnesses, shareholders,
debtors, heirs and beneficiaries.

LEXIS-NEXIS is aware of the sensitivities regarding the potential misuse of
information.  Business competitors of LEXIS-NEXIS have for some time made
Social Security numbers available to users of their services.  In addition,
Social Security Numbers and other information are available on the Internet
from a number of sources.  Despite this wide availability of Social Security
numbers in the market place, LEXIS-NEXIS discontinued the display of Social
Security numbers in the P-TRAK file as of June 11, 1996, eleven days after
the product was introduced.

Through its actions, LEXIS-NEXIS is balancing the privacy concerns of the
public with the legitimate needs of legal, business and government
professionals for access to accurate sources of publicly available
information.  By discontinuing the display of Social Security numbers in
P-TRAK and only providing information that is already available to the
public from other sources, LEXIS-NEXIS believes it has responsibly met the
expressed concerns of the public.

Individuals interested in having their names removed from the P-TRAK file
can e-mail their full name and complete address to:
p-trak@prod.lexis-nexis.com or mail this information to ATTN: P-TRAK, P. O.
Box 933, Dayton, OH 45401.

STATEMENT OF TIM O'REILLY, PRESIDENT OF O'REILLY & ASSOCIATES, IN
RESPONSE TO CONFIRMATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION OF
MICROSOFT

September 19, 1996, Sebastopol, CA--Tim O'Reilly, upon learning of the
confirmed investigation of Microsoft by the federal Department of
Justice, called for Microsoft to cease its anti-competitive behavior.
Mr. O'Reilly made the following comments:

"I'm delighted to hear about the Department of Justice
investigation. We don't know what they'll find, but we do know
that Microsoft's recent practices have been bad for users, and
they have demonstrated a pattern of anti-competitive behavior.
The fact of this investigation will further alert people to
Microsoft's activities. I believe in the marketplace, and think
that there can be a healthy impact on the marketplace from the
DOJ investigation.

"Each time O'Reilly & Associates has brought a particular fact about
Microsoft into the public eye, the response from Microsoft has been
deceptive and confusing.  In July, 1996, we complained publicly about
their 10-connection limit on Windows NT Workstation. In response,
Microsoft removed the 10-connection limit from the code, but then kept
it in the user license. Further, Microsoft made extravagant claims that
they were doing this for users: they claimed that NT Workstation was
just not suitable as a Web server platform.  That claim inspired our
Senior Editor Andrew Schulman's investigation into the actual
differences between NT Workstation and NT Server. He found that,
indeed, at the core, they are not very different at all.

"Microsoft doesn't need to win every battle to stifle innovation. As
powerful as they are, they can determine the terms under which software
development happens, and they can seriously limit important development
by their anti-competitive behavior. Here's an example: when O'Reilly &
Associates first developed and marketed WebSite(TM), Microsoft patted
us on the back, because we were legitimizing NT as a Web server
platform. But when Microsoft decided they wanted the Web server market
for themselves, they used their restrictive NT 4.0 Workstation user
license as a tool to frighten users against using any competitors' Web
servers on that platform.  Microsoft's actions have made it difficult
for us, as well as all other server vendors, to compete. So what kind
of industry does that create?

"Netscape has claimed that many people have been afraid to speak in
fear of retribution from Microsoft. Netscape has said that now, these
people will feel free to speak publicly, and I think that should prove
very enlightening. I hope the Department of Justice will vigorously
pursue this investigation. I also hope the public will hold Microsoft
to the same high standard of business practices to which our entire
industry should adhere."

Subject: File 5--Condat denies the Crypt Newsletter's editor accusations

This morning, I receive the Cu Digest #8.66 and carefully read the
file 3 with a complete surprise. I never send any article related to
computer viruses troubles during the US Army's Bosnian deployment
plagiarizing the well-knowned Crypt Newsletter.

After my publication of the Mark A. Ludwig's book "The Little Black
Book of Computer Viruses" with Addison-Wesley France ("Naissance
d'un virus" for the first volume and "Mutation d'un virus" for the
second one), I have had a lot of problems: night & day phone calls,
injures, public critics on French TV and/or magazines, etc. I stop
the crazy rumors immediately.  I don't writte any more computer
virus' articles; I don't participate to any security events; I don't
collaborate to any craking/phreaking/swapping actions. For example,
I don't participate to the French 2600 meeting in Porte d'Italie in
Paris last week.

As my understanding, this previous email under my name was send to
CuD editors from and unauthorized source.  As some of you know, I
have been having problems with the secret services in the past and I
got into a large battle with was France Telecom -vs- Me.  It is
stupid to get into an argument with that kind of corporation, and a
few words and threats were thrown, they locked all my phone
accounts. I wrote a letter in response of that and they proceded to
harass my company that put me immediately out. Also some lamers
posted some hoax letters in the French news groups and whatever.
They eventually decided to charge me and whatever, and to save me
time outta the Paris courts and crap like that I made an apology for
the threats, seeing that they could incriminate me. France Telecom
has done wrong and I probably won't be seeing alot of apologies
coming my way. If they didn't have certain info about me... they
could have me very well laughing at them but that is not the case.

At this time, I have some crazy guys that don't hesitate to put all
the scripts of my TV shows
(http://www.magic.be/InterieurNuit/SiteMars/Condat.html), or to put
my picture (http://www.condat.de/condat/jean-b/). Yesterday, I lost
my job of senior consultant in the Smart Card Business Unit of
Informix because  Mr. Tariq Krim of the ENST in Paris don't hesitate
to call all my chiefs with some kind words on my life. In France,
this type of action permit to put me out the company some seconds
after.

"Information wants to be free" is false. I have to many subjects to
writte on that to plagiarized Crypt News will be a "sincerest form
of flattery", like George Smith writte. But I prefer the unpolically
correct French-style-approach, the savoir-vivre of Paris. Accept all
my real excuses for all the French guy like Krim that prefer to
crash my career for having the pleasure to be the best! I read Crypt
News with pleasure and always respect the international copyright
notices.

Apologetically,

=============================================================================
CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.20
Original issue date: September 18, 1996
Last revised: --

Topic: Sendmail Vulnerabilities
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                *** This advisory supersedes CA-95:05 ***

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of two security problems in
sendmail that affect all versions up to and including 8.7.5. By exploiting
the first of these vulnerabilities, users who have local accounts can gain
access to the default user, which is often daemon. By exploiting the second
vulnerability, any local user can gain root access.

The CERT/CC team recommends installing vendor patches or upgrading to the
current version of sendmail (8.7.6). Until you can do so, we urge you to
apply the workaround provided in Sec. III.C. In all cases, be sure to take
the extra precautions listed in Sec. III.D.

For beta testers of sendmail 8.8: The vulnerabilities described in this
advisory have been fixed in the beta version.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information. Please
check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site. In
addition, you can check ftp://info.cert.org/pub/latest_sw_versions/sendmail
to identify the most current version of sendmail.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     There are two vulnerabilities in all versions of sendmail up to and
     including sendmail 8.7.5. The first vulnerability is a resource starvation
     problem and the second is a buffer overflow problem.

     Resource Starvation
     -------------------

     When email is forwarded to a program using a .forward file or an :include:
     statement within a .forward or alias file, that program is executed as the
     owner of the .forward file or the file referenced by the :include:
     statement. Similarly, if email is forwarded to a file, that file is
     opened as the owner of the .forward file or the file referenced by the
     :include: statement. The file owner is called the "controlling user."

     If the message cannot be delivered immediately, the name of the
     controlling user is written into the queue file along with the other
     delivery information so that the appropriate permissions can be acquired
     when the mail queue is processed.

     Only the name of the controlling user is written in the queue file. This
     name is derived by calling the system routine getpwuid(3) on the user id
     of the file owner. If getpwuid fails, the sendmail default user (defined
     by the DefaultUser option in 8.7 and by the "u" and "g" options in older
     releases) is assumed.

     In some cases, the system can be forced into resource starvation, thus
     forcing getpwuid(3) to fail even though an entry exists in /etc/passwd
     corresponding to that uid. Since getpwuid has no way of portably
     returning an error meaning "resource failure" as distinct from "user id
     not found," sendmail has no way of distinguishing between these cases; it
     assumes that the uid is unknown and falls back to the default user.

     By starving sendmail of specific resources, sendmail will create files
     owned by the default user. Once created, these files can be used to
     access other files owned by the default user. In addition, these files
     owned by the default user can be used to leverage access to other
     privileged users on the system.

     Buffer Overflows
     ----------------
     There are several buffer overflows present in sendmail version 8.7.5 and
     earlier. Some of the buffer overflows could result in local users gaining
     unauthorized root access.

     Significant work has been done on sendmail version 8.8 (now in beta
     test) to eliminate the problem, and the code changes originally planned
     for 8.8 have been backported to 8.7.6 to address these vulnerabilities.

II.  Impact

     Resource Starvation
     -------------------
     Anyone with access to an account on the system can run programs or write
     files as the default user. The danger of compromising the default user
     depends primarily on the other files in your system owned by that user.

     For example, on many systems the line printer spool directory (e.g.,
     /var/spool/lpd) is owned by daemon; because the line printer subsystem
     runs setuid root, it may be possible to gain additional privileges.
     However, some other systems have no files owned by user daemon on the
     default system, and the only files owned by group daemon are not
     writable by that group; hence, the danger is minimal.

     Buffer Overflows
     ----------------
     Anyone with access to an account on the system can gain root access.

III. Solution

     Install a patch from your vendor if one is available (Sec. A) or upgrade
     to the current version of sendmail (Sec. B). Until you can take one of
     those actions, we recommend applying the workaround described in Sec. C.
     This workaround addresses the resource starvation problem but not buffer
     overflows.

     In all cases, you should take the precautions listed in Sec. D.

     Note to beta testers of sendmail 8.8: The vulnerabilities described in
     this advisory have been fixed in the beta version of 8.8.

     A. Install a vendor patch.

        Below is a list of the vendors who have provided information about
        sendmail. Details are in Appendix A of this advisory; we will update
        the appendix as we receive more information. If your vendor's name
        is not on this list, please contact the vendor directly.

            Digital Equipment Corporation
            Hewlett-Packard Company
            IBM Corporation
            Linux
            Open Software Foundation
            The Santa Cruz Operation
            Silicon Graphics Inc.
            Sun Microsystems, Inc.

     B. Upgrade to the current version of sendmail.

        Install sendmail 8.7.6. This version is a "drop in" replacement for
        8.7.x. There is no patch for 8.6.x. If you are using version 8.6 or
        earlier, you need to upgrade to the current version and rebuild your
        sendmail.cf files. Upgrading to version 8.7.6 addresses both
        vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

        Sendmail 8.7.6 is available from

ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/ucb/src/sendmail/sendmail.8.7.6.tar.gz
ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/sendmail/sendmail.8.7.6.tar.gz

        MD5 (sendmail.8.7.6.tar.gz) = 4a1f2179c53c9106bc8d7738f4d55667

        Also in that directory are .Z and .sig files. The .Z file contains the
        same bits as the .gz file, but is compressed using UNIX compress
        instead of gzip. The .sig is Eric Allman's PGP signature for the
        uncompressed tar file. The key fingerprint is

                                Eric P. Allman <eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU>

        We strongly recommend that when you change to a new version of sendmail
        you also change to the configuration files that are provided with that
        version.

        Significant work has been done to make this task easier. It is now
        possible to build a sendmail configuration file (sendmail.cf) using the
        configuration files provided with the sendmail release. Consult the
        cf/README file for a more complete explanation. Creating your
        configuration files using this method makes it easier to incorporate
        future changes to sendmail into your configuration files.

        Finally, for Sun users, a paper is available to help you convert your
        sendmail configuration files from the Sun version of sendmail to one
        that works with sendmail version 8.7.x. The paper is entitled
        "Converting Standard Sun Config Files to Sendmail Version 8" and was
        written by Rick McCarty of Texas Instruments Inc. It is included in
        the distribution and is located in contrib/converting.sun.configs.

     C. Apply a workaround.

        Resource Starvation
        -------------------
        Eric Allman, the author of sendmail, has provided the following
        workaround to the resource starvation vulnerability.

        Using smrsh as "prog" mailer limits the programs that can be run as
        the default user. Smrsh does not limit the files that can be written,
        but less damage can be done by writing files directly.

        The damage can be almost entirely constrained by ensuring that the
        default user is an innocuous one. Sendmail defaults to 1:1 (daemon)
        only because that is reasonably portable. A special "mailnull"
        account that is used only for this purpose would be better. This user
        should own no files and should have neither a real home directory nor
        a real shell. A sample password entry might be:

           mailnull:*:32765:32765:Sendmail Default User:/no/such/dir:/dev/null

        A corresponding entry should be made in /etc/group:

           mailnull:*:32765:

        These assume that there are no other users or groups with id = 32765
        on your system; if there are, pick some other unique value. After
        creating this user, change the line in /etc/sendmail.cf reading

           O DefaultUser=1:1

         to read

           O DefaultUser=mailnull

        If you are running 8.6.*, you will have to change the lines reading

           Ou1
           Og1

        to read

           Ou32765
           Og32765

       Finally, if you are using the m4(1)-based sendmail configuration scheme
       provided with sendmail 8.7.*, you should add the following line to the
       m4 input file, usually named sendmail.mc:

           define(`confDEF_USER_ID', 32765:32765)

       The actual values should, of course, match those in the passwd file.

       Buffer Overflows
       ----------------
       There is no workaround for the buffer overflow problem. To address this
       problem, you must apply your vendor's patches or upgrade to the current
       version of sendmail (version 8.7.6).

D. Take additional precautions.

   Regardless of which solution you apply, you should take these extra
   precautions to protect your systems.

   * Use the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh)

     With *all* versions of sendmail, use the sendmail restricted shell
     program (smrsh). You should do this whether you use vendor-supplied
     sendmail or install sendmail yourself. Using smrsh gives you improved
     administrative control over the programs sendmail executes on behalf of
     users.

     A number of sites have reported some confusion about the need to continue
     using the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh) when they install a
     vendor patch or upgrade to a new version of sendmail. You should always
     use the smrsh program.

     smrsh is included in the sendmail distribution in the subdirectory
     smrsh. See the RELEASE_NOTES file for a description of how to integrate
     smrsh into your sendmail configuration file.

     smrsh is also distributed with some operating systems.

   * Use mail.local

     If you run /bin/mail based on BSD 4.3 UNIX, replace /bin/mail with
     mail.local, which is included in the sendmail distribution. It is also
     included with some other operating systems distributions, such as
     FreeBSD.

     Although the current version of mail.local is not a perfect solution, it
     is important to use it because it addresses vulnerabilities that are
     being exploited. For more details, see CERT advisory CA-95:02.

     Note that as of Solaris 2.5 and beyond, mail.local is included with the
     standard distribution. To use mail.local, replace all references to
     /bin/mail with /usr/lib/mail.local. If you are using the M4(1)-based
     configuration scheme provided with sendmail 8.X, add the following to
     your configuration file:

        define(`LOCAL_MAILER_PATH', /usr/lib/mail.local)

   * WARNING: Check for executable copies of old versions of mail programs

     If you leave executable copies of older versions of sendmail installed
     in /usr/lib (on some systems, it may be installed elsewhere), the
     vulnerabilities in those versions could be exploited if an intruder
     gains access to your system. This applies to sendmail.mx as well as
     other sendmail programs. Either delete these versions or change the
     protections on them to be non-executable.

     Similarly, if you replace /bin/mail with mail.local, remember to remove
     old copies of /bin/mail or make them non-executable.
