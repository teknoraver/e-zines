             Hacker posts nudes on court's Web pages
               By ROB CHEPAK of The Tampa Tribune


TALLAHASSEE - The Internet home of the Florida Supreme Court isn't
the kind of place you'd expect to find nudity.

But that's what happened Wednesday morning when a judge in
Tallahassee found a pornographic photo while he was looking for
the latest legal news.

A computer hacker broke into the high court's cyberhome, placing
at least three pornographic photos and a stream of obscenities on
its Web pages.

                          .............

The Florida Court's Web site is used to post information about
court opinions, state law and legal aid.  Thousands of people,
including children, use the court system's more than 500 Internet
pages each month, Waters said.

                          .............

Officials aren't sure how the culprit broke in, and FDLE had no
suspects Thursday afternoon. But court officials long have
suspected their Web site could be a target for hackers armed with
the computer equipment to impose photos on the Web. The Florida
Supreme Court became the first state Supreme Court in the nation
to create its own Internet pages two years ago.

                          .............

Without a clear motive or obvious physical evidence, FDLE
investigators, who also investigate child pornography on the
Internet, hope to retrace the culprit's steps in cyberspace.
However, Ponder said cases of Internet tampering are "very
difficult to solve."

Thursday, the state's top legal minds, who are used to handing out
justice, seemed unaccustomed to being cast as victims.

"No damage was done," Kogan said in a statement. "But this episode
did send a message that there was a flaw in our security that we
now are fixing."

SPA Files Copyright Suits Against ISPs and End Users

   Internet Anti-Piracy Campaign Launched


     _________________________________________________________________

   (Oct.10, 1996 --Washington, D.C.) -- The Software Publishers
   Association (SPA) announced today that it has filed five civil
   lawsuits for copyright infringement occurring on the Internet. Three
   of the lawsuits were filed against Internet service providers (ISPs),
   and the remaining two were filed against individual end users.
   Additionally, SPA launched its Internet Anti-Piracy Campaign, which
   includes education and enforcement components, in an effort to educate
   and work cooperatively with ISPs regarding copyright infringement.

   ISP lawsuits were filed on Oct. 7 and 8 against Community ConneXion of
   Oakland, Calif.; GeoCities of Beverly Hills, Calif.; and Tripod Inc.
   of Williamstown, Mass. The SPA members named as plaintiffs in all
   three suits were Adobe Systems Inc., Claris Corp. and Traveling
   Software Inc. In each case, SPA first contacted the ISP and requested
   that the infringing material be removed, but the ISP failed to respond
   and cooperate.

   SPA also filed suit against Jeffrey Workman of Auburn, W. V., and
   Patricia Kropff of Scottsdale, Pa, on behalf of Adobe Systems Inc.,
   Claris Corp., Corel Corp., Datastorm Technologies Inc. and Novell,
   Inc. In each of these instances, SPA received reports of alleged
   copyright infringement on certain Web sites, and with the assistance
   of the ISPs, tracked the individuals responsible for posting the
   infringing material.

   "These lawsuits send a clear signal to ISPs and end users that neither
   direct nor contributory copyright infringement will be tolerated. The
   Internet does not provide a safe haven for these types of activities,"
   said Ken Wasch, SPA president.

   SPA's Internet Anti-Piracy Campaign (IAPC), which is outlined at
   http://www.spa.org/piracy/iapc.htm, contains information explaining
   why ISPs may be liable for copyright infringement, the risks involved
   and seven warning signs that infringing activity may be taking place
   on the ISP's server. Additionally, ISPs may sign an ISP Code of
   Conduct to show they have adopted the operating practices encouraged
   under the copyright law.

   Upon receiving a report of alleged copyright infringement on the
   Internet, SPA confirms the unlawful activity and sends a letter to the
   ISP servicing the infringing user. In most cases, the ISP cooperates
   and remedies the situation. If the infringing user can be identified
   -- as alleged in the Workman and Kropff cases -- SPA may then choose
   to seek action against the end user. If the ISP is unwilling to stop
   the unlawful activity, SPA may choose to file suit against the ISP.

   "Our intentions are to work cooperatively with ISPs. A key element of
   the IAPC is the ISP Education Program devoted to alerting ISPs to
   their potential liability and providing them with the tools and
   guidance to protect themselves," said Joshua Bauchner, SPA's
   Litigation Coordinator.

   "The IAPC maintains SPA's traditional balance between education and
   enforcement. We first make contact in an effort to amicably resolve
   the matter, and only when absolutely necessary do we turn to
   litigation."

   An integral part of the cooperative effort between SPA and ISPs is the
   ISP Code of Conduct. This simple agreement asks that ISPs protect
   themselves from liability by stopping pirate activity on their
   systems. In return, SPA will attempt to contact the ISP if it receives
   a piracy report concerning it -- before initiating other action.

   Piracy has taken many forms on the Internet. These include making
   unauthorized copies of software available for download, the posting of
   serial numbers, cracker and hacker utilities and links to pirate FTP
   sites. Although many believe piracy is limited to "warez" or illegal
   copies of software, it extends beyond that narrow definition. Under
   the law, anyone who knows -- or should have known -- of the
   infringement and who assists, encourages or induces the infringement
   is liable for indirect infringement. In each of the actions SPA filed,
   at least two of the above infringements were present.

   For additional information please visit the Internet Anti-Piracy
   Campaign site at http://www.spa.org/piracy/iapc.htm. The ISP Education
   Program information is available at
   http://www.spa.org/piracy/ispinfo.htm. To report a case of piracy
   please contact SPA's hotline at (800) 388-7478, piracy@spa.org or
   complete an on-line intake form at
   http://www.spa.org/piracy/pirreprt.htm.

   SPA is the leading trade association of the desktop software industry,
   representing the leading publishers as well as many start-up firms in
   the business, home office, consumer, education and entertainment
   markets. Its 1,200 members account for 85 percent of the sales of the
   U.S. packaged software industry. SPA press releases are available

    COMMUNITY CONNEXION SUED IN FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT

For release: October 14, 1996
Contact: Sameer Parekh 510-986-8770

Oakland, CA - Community ConneXion, Inc, dba C2Net, condemns the
lawsuit served by Adobe Systems, Inc., Claris Corporation, and
Traveling Software, Inc. as a frivolous lawsuit. "As near as we can
tell," said C2Net President Sameer Parekh, "we are being sued for
being an Internet Service Provider."

C2Net is an ISP, providing shell accounts and web hosting
services. But the company is primarily a software vendor, selling
Stronghold, one of the most popular secure web servers on the
market. "We were looking into joining the Software Publisher's
Association, who filed the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs," said
Parekh, "but it's not very likely to happen at this point."

The lawsuit appears to charge C2Net with liability based upon
allegations that C2Net's customers provide links to pirated software
on other machines and "cracker tools" that allow users to beat
copy-protection mechanisms like software serial numbers.

"It's completely outrageous that the SPA has nothing better to do
than to file frivolous lawsuits against hard-working Internet Service
Providers," said Parekh. "We are not aware of any such links on our
pages or our customer's pages, and if our customers are breaking any
laws, we want to know about it so we can terminate their accounts."
(The lawsuit provides no specific examples.)

The lawsuit was apparently filed after a single attempt to contact the
company with a form-letter e-mail. The copy of the alleged e-mail
included as an attachment to the suit shows the SPA's real
motive. "They want us to sign a 'Code of Conduct'," said
Parekh. "Among other things, we'd have to agree to routinely monitor
our customer's web pages, which we won't do. We deal with complaints
about our customers on a case by case basis, and we have a firm and
clear policy against illegal activity of any sort. We've shut down
accounts for less than what they're alleging in this lawsuit."

"This is clearly a frivolous lawsuit," said Terry Gross, counsel for
C2Net. "The plaintiffs know that an ISP can only be liable if it
participates in and has knowledge of the improper activity, and it is
clear that they have no such basis."

Although the lawsuit does not mention the "Code of Conduct", it
appears that most ISPs who received the e-mail ended up signing it,
largely to avoid legal action from the much-feared SPA. Those that
didn't kowtow got sued.

"The terms of the 'Code of Conduct' are completely unacceptable," said
Parekh. "It basically gives the SPA the right to go on an ongoing
fishing expedition through our customer's files, and requires us to do
the same as their agent on a regular basis.  The Code would classify
us as 'publishers', and we would become responsible for everything our
customers do. We've built this business on a solid foundation of
respect for our customer's privacy. Monitoring their activities
without grounds for suspicion is completely inconsistent with
maintaining their privacy."

"This lawsuit is grossly unfair, and it's going to cost us a lot of
time and money, but we don't have any choice but to fight it," said
Parekh. "What we have here is three giant software companies and their
well-funded bag of lawyers trying to bully a smaller software company
into adopting costly policies that invade customers' privacy."

A coalition is currently being formed to fight this case and make sure
that this form of legal terrorism does not occur in the future against
internet providers. The coalition will probably include the three companies
that have been served in the suit and other organizations with a stake
in creating a rational legal enviroment for ISPs and their customers.

For Release October 24, 1996

	    LAWSUIT DROPPED; SPA STILL DEMANDS MONITORING

Oakland, CA - In an ongoing attempt to force Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to monitor their customers' web pages, the Software
Publisher's Association (SPA), acting on behalf of three member
software companies, dropped a lawsuit against Community ConneXion,
Inc., dba C2Net, but reserved the right to bring the suit again if
C2Net failed to adopt a policy of monitoring their users' web pages
for copyright infringement.

The three plaintiffs, Adobe Systems, Inc., Claris Corporation, and
Traveling Software, Inc., seemed surprised to find that they had filed
the lawsuit, and sought to distance themselves from the action. For
instance, Adobe's PR department maintained that Adobe has definitely
not filed any such lawsuiT. (Contact Carol Sacks -- (408) 536-4033)

C2Net, a small, Oakland-based ISP and software company, has always
forbidden illegal activity on its servers. This includes copyright
infringement and contributory copyright infringement.  "We're very
aware of the problems that software companies face from piracy; most
of our revenue comes from software and we have our own problems with
people pirating our software," said C2Net President Sameer Parekh. "I
just don't think that bullying hard-working ISPs into embracing a
highly questionable set of policies does anything constructive about
the problem of piracy."

The Software Publishers Association wants ISPs to sign a 'Code of
Conduct' which would force ISPs to actively monitor users.  Under
current case law, this greatly increases the ISP's liability, in
addition to being extremely expensive, time-consuming, and distasteful
to users.

"The telephone company isn't required to monitor all their users to
make sure they're not saying illegal things," said Parekh. "How can we
be expected to do that for our customers' use of the Internet?"

Of the over twenty ISPs contacted by the SPA, many caved in and signed
the 'Code of Conduct', fearing a lawsuit from the SPA more than the
future expense and liability problems that result from ongoing
monitoring. A coalition of ISPs and other concerned parties, the ISP
Defense Coalition, has formed to oppose these bullying tactics by the
SPA.

"The SPA thought they could bully small ISPs, but they didn't
realize we had principles and couldn't be cowed," said Parekh.

Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation
said, "My personal view is that the Software Publishers Association
has forgotten that it is the legislature, not the courts, that is the
primary avenue for seeking changes in copyright policy.  What we see
here is a perversion of the notion that the courts should be used to
seek justice -- SPA seems to have picked defendants in the hope that
they'd be too weak to resist. I find that decision morally
objectionable. Speaking as a lawyer, I have to say that this is the
kind of tactic that justifiably confirms in people's minds whatever
low opinions they may have of lawyers."

The suit alleged that C2Net users were providing tools to get around
copy protection in the plaintiffs' software, and were providing
pointers to other sites that actually contained pirated software. The
SPA provided no examples, and did not allege any direct copyright
infringement on C2Net machines.

"Despite our best efforts to get specific information," said Parekh,
"the SPA did not provide us with any specifics about our customers
engaging in infringing activity. We suspect that they had no evidence
of infringement, but acted merely on vague reports of questionable
conduct on the part of a few users."

Novell Brings Largest Ever Internet Piracy Case

Swiss Police Swoop On  Internet Pirate In Dawn Raid

        Following months of undercover investigation by Novell's
Anti-Piracy Group, on 15th October 1996, Swiss Police executed an
early morning raid in Zurich on the home of a 27 year old computer
technician calling himself *The Pirate'.
        *The Pirate' was offering $60,000 of unlicensed Novell products,
along with commercial software from other Business Software Alliance
(BSA) members, to anyone with a connection to the Internet. During the
enquiry, Novell Anti-Piracy investigators also found files containing bomb
making recipes and instructions for defrauding credit cards.
        During the raid officers from the Swiss Police Commercial Crime
Unit seized an extensive collection of computer hardware and software.
*The Pirate' who was taken into custody, could face a maximum prison
sentence of 3 years and/or a fine of up to SFR 100,000 (USD80,000) if
convicted.
        In a related action on the same day, the Swiss police raided the
M-E-M-O Bulletin Board System (BBS) run by a systems operator calling
himself *The Shadow'. The M-E-M-O BBS was believed to have close
connections with *The Pirate' and in addition to making available
unlicensed Novell software via the telephone network, also offered a CD
and DAT tape writing service.
        Martin Smith Novell's Licensing Manager for Europe Middle East
and Africa says, *This is a landmark case for the software industry. For
the first time today, individuals and organisations distributing unlicensed
software on the Internet know that they can be caught and prosecuted.
This case is the first of a series of Internet related actions which will be
brought by Novell and the BSA in Europe in the coming months.*
        Smith continued *Novell is committed to working with law
enforcement groups throughout Europe to halt the supply of illegal
products on the Internet. Electronic distribution of illegally duplicated
software poses a threat both to the industry and consumers. In many
cases the software available from such sites has been passed around
the world, each transfer exposing it to potential corruption and viruses.
For the end-user this inevitably leads to system down time or loss of
data.*

hotlines, a list of which accompany this release.

Subject: File 8--AOL - Breaking Spam News

CNN is reporting that today the FBI "hinted" they were close to making an
arrest in the child pornography spam.

Stories have appeared in Reuters, the Associated Press, CNN, and the
Washington Post.  Reuters reported that AOL was "deluged" with complaints,
and said the FBI observed tips came to their offices "around the country".
More interesting, an AOL officer told Reuters the account holders were not
the ones who sent the mail.

Hackers have been boasting about the capability to access any AOL
account--without a password--since last spring.  Some speculate hackers
had moles in AOL's customer service department--when the editor of
Internet Underground magazine contacted hackers for a story, they offered
to recite his credit card number as proof.  In July the Florida Times-
Union reported AOL's Florida customer service building housed an employee
who helped "hijack" customer credit card numbers.  When arrested and
convicted, he implicated two other employees [7/7/96].  AOL caught 38 of
their own staffers in a June raid on the Warez chat room.  And to this
day, one hacker's web page contains screen shots of AOL's internal
software. (http://www.netvirtual.com/blank/aol/)

Even Reuters has picked up on AOL's low-security climate.  Their story
noted that "Hackers have in the past established bogus America Online
accounts using stolen credit card numbers and the signup disks the service
widely distributes..."  The Washington Post reported 370,000 fake accounts
were created between March and June [9/16/96]).

That lends an odd context to the child pornography spam.  Earlier this
year AOL's postmaster collected the tens of thousands of messages
Cyberpromotions sent to invalid addresses--then bounced them back, all at
once.  Cyberpromotions saw this as a vindictive prank, and took AOL to
court, but some netizens lauded AOL for their effective retaliation.

But today a University of Maryland graduate student told the San Francisco
Examiner he received ten pieces of spam advertising a program called
AKIMA--giving the same address in Jackson Heights.  The student said he
believes the child pornography mail was retaliation for the earlier spams
advertising AKIMA--a program which, ironically, allows mass e-mailing to
AOL subscribers.

This raises the question:  was the child pornography spam a variation of
the postmaster's prank, perpetrated by someone within AOL?  Their customer
service department's ties to the hacker community beg the question.  In
September, speaking about unwanted spam, Steve Case said "this is the
number one complaint we hear from our members."

Either way, the event is being used to push pre-existing agendas.  In an
interview with the San Francisco Examiner, a federal law enforcement
official "said it is apparently not against the law to pull a hoax on the
Internet."  And CNN took this opportunity to link to their "related"
story, "Pedophiles stalk internet for victims".  In September they had
interviewed two customs agents, reporting that the two "said they become
suspicious when someone offers pictures of celebrities--often a code word
for child pornography."

Coincidentally, CNN cites them as the agents who arrested Robert Green and
Richard Russell--the school teachers running the child pornography ring on
America Online (mentioned in a previous update).  The Customs agents told
CNN the teachers had "used computers to lure children to a certain
location, where they would be molested."  The Phoenix Gazette reported the
men would then produce videotapes of the children they met on America
Online.  One of the boys was 11, the other 15; they were paid $15 each.

Ironically, news of the account breach came from AOL's public affairs
officer William Burrington, who was last seen at the Philadelphia trial
for the Communications Decency Act, where Declan McCullagh's dispatch said
he characterized AOL "as a 'resort pool with lifeguards' next to the wild,
untamed ocean of the Internet".  Current events don't bear that out.  Part
of the problem is their resort pool offers an unlimited supply of fake
screen names--and apparently, the security on them isn't foolproof.  (Even
with the "lifeguards"...)

In 1995 Burrington also testified before Congress about AOL's child
pornography problems. He attributed the trafficking to "a very small
percentage of its customers."  An article in the Boston Phoenix, noting
Burrington's "wind-tunnel-resistant hair", suggested the obvious follow-up
question would be, "what percentage of members who traffic in child
pornography is acceptable to AOL?"

     Earlier today an AOL user e-mailed hundreds of people, announcing "I
     have pictures, VHS tapes, posters, audio recordings, and games
     based on child pornography."

     The notorious mail included a price-list and an address in Jackson
     Heights, New York. Several hundred students at the University of
     Oslo reportedly received copies, as did students at Yale. The
     message was e-mailed to Oregon, Georgia, Illinois, and New York, as
     well as England, Australia, Holland, Finland, Germany, and Canada
     (according to Usenet posts). The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
     received several calls, as did Interpol. One ISP reported 10 of
     their 1,000 users received copies--close to 1%.

     Even some net personalities received copies. Ron Newman, formerly
     of the MIT Media Lab, received the e-mail at five different
     accounts. Joe Shea, editor of the American Reporter, received a
     copy; Philip Elmer-DeWitt, author of Time magazine's "Cyberporn"
     cover story, received two. The authors of "The Stalker's Home
     Page," and "Why AOL Sucks" also received the e-mail.

     Responding to complaints, AOL stated "we have closed the accounts
     involved, and our legal department is taking action." Postmaster
     David O'Donnell posted to Usenet, "Please do not send in more
     reports of this abuse". Over 50 people complained to the New York
     police department, who investigated the location--a P.O. Box--with
     the FBI. (On a mailing list Brock Meeks noted that AOL has a
     "working relationship" with the FBI.)

     A reporter for the New York-based Newsday says the newspaper will
     probably carry a story about the event in Tuesday's edition.
     (http://www.newsday.com) According to one Usenet post, the
     address belongs to one of AOL's "disk dancers". The mailing address
     of the (presumably-framed) New Yorker is for sales of a program
     that lets AOL users spend time on the system without being charged.

     This is not the first time AOL's hacker community has cross swords
     with child pornography. The documentation for AOHell contains a
     section called "Why I made AOHell." "I'm sick of all the God damn
     pedophiles," the program's author states. "AOL constantly closed
     the 'Hackers' Member room, but refuses to do anything about all the
     pedophilia rooms...If AOL is going to do nothing about this type of
     sick behavior then I will do everything I can to screw AOL up."

     Instead, users signing onto AOL tonight received an advertisement
     for hardware that can "grab color images right from your camcorder,
     VCR, or TV." This December marks the five-year anniversary of the
     first child pornography scandal on AOL. In 1991 Newsweek reported
     that one subscriber posing as a child "received pictures of what
     appear to be youngsters involved in sexual acts." AOL's members
     didn't find out about the incident until the story turned up on
     CNN. (Mainly because the outraged user went straight to the
     network.)

     In 1993, ten-year-old George Burdynski disappeared from Brentwood,
     Virginia. He was never seen again--but his disappearance launched
     the largest child pornography investigation in FBI history. In
     September of 1995, the FBI raided the homes of 120 AOL users, and
     in July the FBI raided 100 homes just in Cincinnati. Days before,
     one agent told the Cincinnati Enquirer "there are new people being
     identified daily." The FBI had information on more than 3,000
     users--which at the time constituted one out of every 1,200 AOL
     subscribers; "FBI and America Online records revealed that during
     one 25-minute span when an illegal photograph was made available on
     the computer service, about 400 people nationwide downloaded the
     picture to their computers." Jean Villanueva stated that AOL
     contacted the FBI "upon receiving the material, and verifying that
     it was in all likelihood illegal". (At least one children's rights
     activist questioned the legality of the delays "verification" added
     to AOL's response.)

     Earlier that year U.S. Customs Officials cracked a child
     pornography ring operating on America Online. In February of 1995
     two teachers in Florida were charged, and a third suspect arrested
     in Salt Lake City. A Customs official said photographs were being
     downloaded directly from AOL's shareware section, which apparently
     wasn't monitored round-the-clock. The first guilty verdict from
     that investigation was handed down in February of 1996--for
     photographs a user transmitted in July of 1994. In August an AOL
     user in San Francisco was indicted for his involvement in a
     13-year-old Kentucky girl's 2-week disappearance; in November of
     1995, a New Jersey man was sentenced for actions with a young boy
     in July of 1994.

     The San Francisco Chronicle suggested problems were exacerbated by
     AOL's fully-anonymous screen names. In fact, up until September of
     1995, AOL wasn't even verifying the full authenticity of the credit
     card information users input. That created an entrenched subculture
     of disk dancers that persists to this day. The Washington Post
     reported that between March and June, over 370,000 fake accounts
     were created with bogus credit card information.

     Ironically, the ten-year-old boy who disappeared lived just miles
     from AOL's headquarters in Vienna, Virginia. One children's rights
     advocate is considering setting up a fund in the boy's name.

>The only customers who will be affected are those who:
>
>     * Run Solaris 2.4 systems, with kernel patch 101945-37 or later
>       (for x86 systems, that's kernel patch 101946-35 or later); and

>     * Require accurate timestamps for system log entries and events

>
>The bug involves the C library calls which translate system time into a

>exact effect of the bug is that localtime(3)-format strings will revert
>to "Standard Time" at a moment indicated by GMT, not local time. This
>means, for example, that starting at 0200 hours GMT, Sunday, 27
>October, system logs and other timestamps recorded in local time will
>be off by one hour. The system will continue to record bad timestamps
>until 0200 hours local time, when the real world and the computer's
>calculations will once again agree.
>
>In the Pacific time zone, then, the problem will start at 1800 hours
>PDT and last for eight hours. In the Eastern time zone, the problem
>will start at the same moment (which is 2100 EDT) but only last for
>five hours--0200 comes earlier there! Affected systems in the European
>MET zone will experience the problem only for one hour--and the
>erroneous time will be one hour later than the real time, not earlier,
>as in the U.S.
>
>Note that it is in fact possible to avoid the problem behavior, by
