LOD UPDATE (May 9, 1990):
----------
 
The legal fate of Craig Neidorf (Knight Lightning) is still uncertain.
Motions are currently pending to dismiss the case, and the defense
attorneys are also waiting for rulings on their discovery motions. They
hope to have responses by the end of the May. A status hearing has been set
for May 29, and the trial is scheduled for June 18.  Barring something
dramatic, it appears there will be nothing to report for at least three
more weeks.  The case is in Illinois' Northern Federal District (Chicago),
and the docket number is 90-CR-70.
 
The trial of Robert Riggs and Adam Grant was originally scheduled for
June 4 in Atlanta, but has been delayed, according to court sources.
They indicate that the new trial date will likely be in July or August.
Rumors of a plea bargaining arrangement *HAVE NOT* been confirmed, and
sources indicate that the prosecution is currently intending to procede to
trial. However, this was an "official" position, and did not preclude the
possibility of a bargaining arrangement being negotiated.
The case number in Georgia's Northern District is:  1:90-CR-31
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
FTP PROBLEMS:
----------
 
As many noticed, a bitnet site cannot actually be an FTP site.  The bitnet
address was intended as the source by which users could be steered over to
a workable site. It may not work as well in practice as conceived in the
abstract. We are working on the problem, and will have more information
in the next issue.
requests as we can and then place the files on a central BBS that
accomodates 9600 baud. For those with the new HSTs, this take about 10
minutes for a one-meg download (at a cost of about $1.25). For those still
using 2400, it would cost about $11.00. This isn't ideal, but it's
workable.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
BBS INFO WANTED
-----------
 
We've had some interesting responses to our query about BBSs.  In coming
issues, we'll try to do a series on the history of CU bulletin boards, when
they started, what happened to them, and what's going on now. If you were
(or are) the sysop of a CU board that has been around for a few years, or
if you were a user of one, drop us a note on when it started, what it
caters to, what it's like, or any other information you think relevant.
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR BBS ADS, so don't send any. The intent is to trace
the rather dymanic and rapidly changing nature of this form of social
interaction.

Dear Jim,
 
Nancy and I, uh... I mean Barbara are really proud of the great job you are
doing with all these hackers.  These are dangerous kids that need to be
kept off the street, I mean phone.
 
These kids don't have much of a chance in life without people like
yourself.  Without the care that you show them, they would probably live to
grow up as computer literates.  What a terrible way to live in this day and
age.
 
You know Jim, I have several United States Secret Service agents to protect
me from the holligans in the world, but whenever I can lend a few away to
bust up these hacker-types, I feel proud to be an American.  Keep up the
good work, and tell Gordon hello too.

Re: Observation of Robert Morris Sentencing
 
On Friday May 4th, I went up to the federal courthouse in Syracuse to
witness the sentencing of my fellow Cornell graduate student, Robert T.
Morris, Jr.  I'm not acquainted with Morris, but I've followed the case
closely through the media, Usenet, etc.
 
It seems that every U.S. courthouse has the same airport-style security
system: the walk-through metal detectors, the package conveyor belt.  My
friend and I passed through this and were just about to step on the
elevator when we hear the guards laugh, saying "Here comes Robert!", and
around the corner of the building comes a grim-faced, hands-in-pockets
Morris Junior, surrounded by a cloud of dozens of microphone and camera
wielding reporters.  "Pack journalism," sniffs my friend; the grinning
guards let our elevator go, and we reach the third floor ahead of the mob.
 
Apparently Judge Munson's sentencings were handled routinely every Friday
at 2:00 PM.  This particular Friday, only two are scheduled; besides
Morris, there's a contractor who underpaid his employees on a Federal
construction project (sitting in the pew behind me, the contractor's lawyer
says to his client: "Don't worry, these people aren't all here for you.").
Ironically, the contractor's basic sentence (three years probation) is the
same as what is later pronounced on Morris; the contractor, however, is
required to make restitution to the aggrieved employees, and is prohibited
from bidding on federal contracts for some period.
 
With the contractor out of the way, the main show begins.  First, the
defense attorneys (Guidoboni and O'Brien), always referring to their client
as "Robert," make lengthy statements.  He's a "decent kid," they urge, who
has taken responsibility for his actions and is properly repentant.
 
Guidoboni, in particular, spends a good deal of time arguing about the
sentencing guidelines.  Though I am not familiar with the Federal
sentencing guidelines, I have worked with Michigan's version, and they
basic concepts are the same.  Fundamentally, the idea is to limit what used
to be unfettered judicial discretion over sentencing, under which people
committing similar crimes -- indeed, two partners in the same crime --would
routinely get radically different sentences, depending on which judge was
presiding and how he felt that day.
 
Given the stories they wrote, most of the reporters were completely
befuddled by the argument over the guidelines.  Suffice it to say that the
new Computer Fraud and Abuse statute had been classified (presumably by
court rule) as a "six," a "fraud and deceit" crime.  The pre-sentence
report applied this guideline, adding extra points for "special skills,"
and came up with a sentence of just under two years (I don't recall the
specific numbers offhand -- I think it was 21 months).  Guidoboni argued
that fraud and deceit (and motivating greed) were not part of "Robert's"
crime; at most, it should be classified under "destruction of property,"
which was a "four" and carried correspondingly lower sentences.
 
Judges are allowed to depart from the guidelines, but they are required to
make clear why the guidelines were inadequate to determine the sentence in
the particular case.  When I was practicing law in Michigan, one judge's
failure to make such a statement enabled me to get a client's sentence
reduced.
 
The prosecution surprised me by saying very little.  Essentially, he said
he understood that the judge might want to depart from the guidelines in
this case, but hoped that he would sentence Morris to *some* jail time.
Then he sat down.  If all the editorial-writers who have been yelling for
Morris' blood had seen it, they would have been appalled: this was the
opportunity for a fire-and-brimstone speech about national security and
billions in damages.  Suddenly, it became clear that "severe punishment"
was *not* in the cards.
 
The judge called a five-minute recess and disappeared into his chambers to
craft his answer.  When he returned, he asked if the defendant had anything
to say; Morris said "no" (the only word he spoke during the entire
proceeding).  The judge then announced that NONE of the sentencing
guidelines applied to this case, and none were even analogous.  Hence, he
was free to use his discretion, and he did: three years probation, $10,000
fine, 400 hours community service, no restitution required.
 
The hearing over, Guidoboni turned to the assembled media, with an air of
contempt and condescension, and said "I'll make it easy for you: Robert has
nothing to say, and he's not going to change his mind."  He announced that
he would make a statement and take questions when he got outside.  The
press assembled on the plaza outdoors, waiting for Guidoboni to make his
appearance.  Most of what he said has been quoted elsewhere.  Afterwards,
we ransomed the car (three bucks for 2 hours parking) and drove back to
Ithaca.
 
What was really striking about all this was the contrast between the fairly
widespread view (among editorial writers and lay people, especially) that
Morris deserved severe punishment and a long prison term, and the reality I
saw in the courtroom.  Even my fiancee had argued that Morris "is guilty
and should go to jail."  I think that people who are unfamiliar with the
legal system don't tend to consider how *good* Morris looks compared to the
more typical criminal defendant who has a history of (a) prior crimes, (b)
drug use, (c) violence, (d) greed, and (e) predatory behavior.  Retribution
is not usually foremost on a sentencing judge's mind; rather, he or she
tries to look toward the impact of the sentence on the defendant's future
behavior.  It is hard to imagine Morris doing anything like the Internet
worm again, so the need to lock him up is anything but pressing.

==================
THE EDITOR SPEAKS:
==================
 
by Alan R. Bechtold
 
"Attack From Above..."
----------------------
 
It's happening all over.  Telephone companies in Texas and Michigan and
Indiana are exerting their power over bulletin board operators, trying to
extort business rates out of anyone who runs a BBS -- whether the bulletin
boards are businesses or not.  It could happen in YOUR state next.
 
A couple of weeks back I wrote about Variety 'N' Spice BBS in Michigan.
Michigan Bell decided that Variety 'N' Spice should pay business rates for its
phone lines and I agreed.  They ran their system on a multitude of lines,
switched in rotary fashion, and in every sense of the word operated the BBS as
if it WERE a business.  It was even listed as a "subdivision" of a publishing
company responsible for a regional computer magazine in the area.
 
I know the sysop of that board and like him a lot.  This wasn't an easy stand
for me to take.  Now I have a copy of the actual regulations covering
classification of telephone customers as business users and a letter from a
Michigan Regulation Officer at the Michigan Department of Commerce, explaining
those regulations in English (thanks, Dennis -- and to everyone who sent me
info on this).
 
It appears I was right.
 
Variety 'N' Spice, operating as a "subsidiary" of an actual company that
published a for-profit magazine, SHOULD have to pay business rates for the
telephone lines it used.
 
BUT, according to the letter I have, from Deborah Phipps, a Regulation
Officer in the Customer Complaint Section of the Michigan Department of
Commerce, "If bulletin boards or access to bulletin boards is provided to
calling parties at no charge other than that which may be associated with the
telephone call, and are not provided in conjunction with a business, a
profession, an institution or other occupation, then it would appear the
service should not be classified as a business."
 
The letter goes on.
 
"If, however, there is a charge associated with any level of access to the
bulletin board, whether the charge is rendered to cover costs or produce a
profit, then the service would be considered a business and classified as
such."
 
This means that if you run an open, free bulletin board in Michigan and it's
strictly a hobby and not associated with a business or organization of any
kind, you have a legitimate complaint if Michigan Bell tries to charge you
business rates for the phone lines you use.
 
To register specific complaints regarding such classifications, call the
Consumer Services Division of the Michigan Public Service Commission at
800/292-9555 or 517/334-6424.
 
Which brings me to Indiana.
 
Last week, Charles Bowen's A NETWORKER'S JOURNAL (right here in INFO-MAT)
reported that Indiana BBS sysops were being hit by GTE with a required
business rate charge for phone lines, regardless of whether the boards are run
as businesses or not.  This is hitting many BBSes with a nearly 200 percent
increase in phone bills.  It's an increase most can't afford or justify.
 
In specific, Bowen mentioned Indiana sysop Randy Wilson, who was among the
first to receive notice of the new increased rates.
 
This week, Bowen quotes CompuServe's Online Today, which quoted Wilson as
saying he has discontinued using Sprint (a GTE long-distance company) and
"strongly urges" his BBS users to discontinue their Sprint service and "go
with one of the other long-distance carriers."
 
Wilson operates a hobby BBS for which he makes NO charge for access.  He told
Online Today that GTE refused to discuss the forced increase in business rates
so he no longer has any interest in their long-distance services.
 
I think Wilson's reaction is perfectly rational.  We as bulletin board
operators and users must NOT back down on our resistance to paying business
rates for telephone lines just because a bulletin board is on them.  They must
be BONA-FIDE BUSINESSES first, and not all BBSes are BUSINESSES!
 
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is telling sysops that "business
rates for home computer lines were approved in January."
 
Read that line again -- CAREFULLY.  It sounds to me like the telephone
companies, if allowed to continue, don't intend to stop with just charging
business rates to bulletin boards.  They eventually plan to charge business
rates to EVERYONE with a computer attached to their phone lines.  That means
you won't be able to set up a separate phone line for your computer without
paying business rates for the line.  That stinks.
 
So.  I back Wilson's idea to boycott GTE (remember -- this is ME talking
here, not INFO-MAT or BBS PRESS SERVICE or any of our affiliate BBSes that
carry INFO-MAT).  I personally support his idea and recommend that you follow
it.
 
If you disagree with GTE's stand against BBS operators in Indiana, Cancel
your SPRINT and GTE long-distance service and switch to other companies not
currently engaged in attempts to gouge computer users for use of their lines.
It will certainly make a strong statement of your feelings, in no uncertain
terms.
 
Also, if your local phone company is trying to charge bulletin board
operators (especially FREE hobby boards) business rates for the use of their
lines, let your local utility regulatory commission know you are outraged.
Lodge a formal protest if possible.
 
And -- I think it's time for us to put our money where our mouths are.  I
have long advocated the need for a true national Modem Users Association.  We
modem users -- sysops and BBS users alike -- are scattered far and wide,
linked by a variety of electronic mail systems and local and regional
associations, but not truly linked into a single, unified voice.
 
I've called for the formation of an organization that not only would link
with existing local and regional groups but also would stretch far beyond
their capabilities, and I've been waiting too long for it to happen.
 
I'm saying let's DO IT.  NOW.
 
I'm willing to coordinate it, but it takes money to put something like this
together and all of you must be willing to come up with some money to get this
off the ground.
 
The organization I propose would act as a central clearing house for
information of interest to BBS users and operators, act as an umbrella linking
local and regional modem user groups into a nationwide network, and unify all
modem users and the services and systems they use.
 
It would also establish a lobbying effort in Washington to push for
legislation favorable to modem users and would fight, state-by-state, against
outrages rate increases and demands from telephone companies and other
entities.
 
Membership in such an organization would be open to individual modem users,
bulletin board sysops, publishers of telecommunications software,
manufacturers of modems and providers of commercial online systems.
 
The organization I envision would require an attorney for the group, a
Washington D.C. lobbyist and a Coordinator for each state.  We would publish a
monthly or weekly electronic newsletter that would be posted on each and every
bulletin board and online service that is a member, and a quarterly newsletter
that would be mailed to each member by U.S. Mail.
 
The organization would establish criteria for operation of online services
and for conduct by online service users, and would consider ways to network
nationwide, tracking down sources of known viruses and "Trojan Horse"-type
software so action can be taken against the perpetrators.
 
Other activities could include discount buying power for software and
hardware, low-cost group health and accident insurance, low-cost insurance for
computers, and, really, all the benefits of any large group.
 
Initial yearly membership in such an organization would be:
 
Individual -- $15
Hobby BBS Operator -- $25
Commercial BBS Operator -- $50
Software Publisher (Shareware) -- $100
Software Publisher (Commercial) -- $250
Hardware Manufacturer -- $500
 
Now let's put this to a vote.
 
I said I would be willing to take on the formation of such an organization
and I meant it.  If you would be willing to support such an organization,
considering the fact that it would be formerly incorporated as a non-profit
organization, and would dedicate itself to the goals and objectives I have
listed above (in addition to others as it goes), send a check to the address
below.
 
Yes, I said SEND A CHECK.  Make it payable to MODEM USER'S ASSOCIATION of
AMERICA, for the appropriate amount from the above list.
 
I will collect the checks and report here every week how much has come in.  I
figure it will take a minimum of $10,000 to start this organization and WILL
NOT CASH ANY CHECKS until at least that amount has been received.  If the
amount necessary to start this organization isn't raised, I will mail a
postcard to everyone who sends a check, letting you know the organization
didn't fly and the check has been destroyed.
 
Now $10,000 sounds like a lot of money but it's only the bare-bones minimum
needed to get an attorney, to incorporate the group as a non-profit
organization, retain a lobbyist in Washington and start things rolling.  It's
a LOT of money but that's reality.
 
So, if you REALLY want it to happen, mark your check with the level of
participation you're signing up for, and mail it, along with your name,
address and telephone number, to:
 
MODEM USER'S ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA
Alan R. Bechtold, Coordinator
8125 S.W. 21st Street
Topeka, KS 66615
 
I hate to sound pessimistic, but this is a challenge I'm betting we won't be
able to meet.  I don't think enough of you REALLY WANT THIS to make it
happen.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I DO believe that what I've proposed is the
way to get things done and protect modem users in the future.  If you agree,
then you now have your way to let me know.  If you don't, just sit there and
watch it all go away.
 
This is drastic stuff -- and I stand willing and ready to take on the
challenge of putting this organization together and getting things done if
you're willing to stand behind me with the dollars it will take to do it
right.
 
Also, feel free to pass this article around.  Copyright is hereby waved and
you are encouraged to upload this to any and all bulletin boards and other
online services you wish.  I WANT you to prove me wrong!
