In This Issue:
 
Issue #1.04 is long--over 2,100 lines--so we have broken it down
into four smaller files.
Keith Henson sent these public documents to us describing how one
organization filed suit against agents for allegedly confiscating
electronic mail illegally. The case raises a number of important issues to
computerists, including the status of E-mail as private communication, the
scope of investigatory authority of law enforcement agents in confiscating
computer "symbols," and other facets of investigation of the use of
computers when an alleged crime has occured.
 
We encourage article-type responses to the any of the many issues raised
here.

Dear Mr. Heller:
 
 
I was astounded at the refusal of the FBI to even make minimal
 
inquiry into a citizen`s complaint of a clear violation of a
 
Federal law. Your advice that I take my complaints to Riverside
 
County is hard to fathom; to the best of my knowledge, the county
 
has no laws regarding intercepting electronic mail.
 
 
Your argument that having an unrelated warrant to take a computer
permits interception of the electronic mail of all people who
were using that computer would (I think) generate great concern
among the staff and members of the House Committee on the Judi-
ciary which held extensive hearing on this law only two years
ago.
 
 
Your reluctance to investigate another law enforcement agency is
understandable, but if the federal government won`t protect citi-
zens from local officials who break Federal laws and violate our
Fourth Amendment rights, who will?
 
Sincerely,
 
H. Keith Henson

Los Angeles, CA  90012
 
 
Dear Mr. Emick:
 
 
This letter is to complain about the refusal of the FBI office in
Riverside to investigate a clear violation of Federal law.
 
Mr. Heller did not pass on the enclosed letter to Alka Sagar of
your office, and she had no recollection Monday of his verbal
arguments for the FBI's inaction.
 
 
I looked into the legislative history of the particular House
Bill which eventually became law and found that James Knapp (who
was then Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
and has since moved to a higher position in the Justice Depart-
ment) had a number of things to say about the impending legisla-
tion. He was particularly interested in forestalling the need for
court orders to obtain access to stored electronic communica-
tions. I quote from his written testimony of March 5, 1986
before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the
 
Administration of Justice:
 
  "The authorization to intercept the communications should be
accomplished by a statute mandating a judicial authorization
based on probable cause akin to that which can now be secured
with a Fourth Amendment search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This procedure is based on
the premise that the interception of electronic mail generally
should be accorded no more protection than that accorded to
regular mail. At the present time regular mail can be seized
with a Rule 41 search warrant. . . .
 
  "The search warrant . . . should be based on a sworn affidavit
establishing probable cause to believe that a crime has been, is
being or is about to be committed. The affidavit and judicial
authorization should sufficiently specify the people involved,
the facility in question, the specific offenses involved, and the
type of information sought to be intercepted. . . ."
 
Congress went along with the Justice Department in requiring
 
search warrants rather than the more cumbersome court orders,
 
with the understanding that they would watch for abuse.
 
 
Michael Emick             -2-                    April 25, 1988
 
 
Now in the case at hand, there was a search warrant, but it was
clearly inadequate to seize electronic mail since it was directed
to the computer rather than its contents and the people who put
 
the contents into it.
 
The correct analogy according to Mr. Knapp's testimony would be a
search warrant obtained against a private postal service in which
all mail in private boxes was confiscated, opened, and read.
 
The search warrant under which the computer was taken was based
on incredible half-truth distortions, and simply irrelevant
information. For example, the prime item presented under oath to
the judge who issued the warrant was verbal testimony about a
copy of a receipt for equipment sold to UCLA, shipped to a
Florida address, and authorized by an Alcor officer who works at
UCLA. In the first place, the coroner's office has no business
investigating theft. If they found something suspicious in the
course of other investigation, they should have turned it over to
the police. In the second place, *taped to the front of that
invoice was a canceled check on the officer's account for the
full amount on the invoice.* If this isn't perjury, it skates
within a hair of it.
 
This may seem to be an unpopular cause to the FBI, but this is
the first time (to my knowledge) that a law enforcement agency
has violated the provisions of this law. As a result, there is a
great deal of interest by a number of people in the electronic
mail industry. If local law enforcement officials demonstrate
that they can get away with ignoring this law, there may be
considerable pressure on Congress to require more stringent
provisions for law enforcement agencies to obtain access to
electronic communications.
 
If you have any questions, please give me a call.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
H. Keith Henson

Dear Representative Mineta:
 
 
I am writing to ask you to intercede with the FBI on behalf of
 
myself and two other San Jose constituents, Thomas K. Donaldson
 
and Roger Gregory. We believe a Federal Law, Section 2701, et
 
seq. of Title 18, was broken by local law enforcement officials in
 
Southern California. We would like you to make a request of the
 
FBI that they determine if this is true, and if it is, ask the
 
U.S. Attorney to file charges.
 
 
All of us used (and paid for through membership fees) an elec-
 
tronic mail facility owned by the Alcor Life Extension Founda-
 
tion. On January 12 of this year, the computer containing our
 
confidential personal communications was seized by the coroner`s
 
office in Riverside under a warrant issued against Alcor and
 
obtained on the basis of gross distortions. Regardless of the
 
validity of this warrant, <2703 requires a warrant naming the
 
individual whose mail is to be seized, and stating probable cause
 
as to the need to invade the individual`s privacy. No warrants
 
have been issued which would permit these officials to access or
 
deny us access to our electronic mail.
 
 
The FBI is understandably reluctant to investigate a fellow law
 
enforcement agency. In my first telephone conversation with Ron
 
Heller he strongly discouraged me from complaining. While it may
 
have been inadvertent, his office lost my first letter (sent by
 
Express Mail), did not pass on the enclosed letter to the U.S.
 
Attorney`s office, and suggested (when he called after 5PM last
 
Friday) that my only recourse is to the same local officials who
 
have violated the law.
 
 
The cited section of law, the Electronic Communications Privacy
 
Act of 1986, and the cases which develop from it are of great
interest in Silicon Valley, where the local volume of electronic
mail may be approaching that of First Class mail. There is a
considerable interest expressed by several computer publications
in the case. I can direct the reporters who are calling me to
your office if you wish.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
 
H. Keith Henson

Dear Representative Mineta:
 
Thank you for pursuing an inquiry for me into the FBI's disinter-
est in an apparent violation of the Electronic Communication Pri-
vacy Act, and for forwarding a copy of Mr. Floyd Clark's letter.
 
In that letter of June 3, the FBI excused their unwillingness to
investigate because the US Attorney declined prosecution. Alka
Sagar, the US Attorney in Los Angeles who Mr. Heller told me had
made the decision to decline prosecution, based her decision
entirely on a short telephone conversation with FBI represen-
tative Mr. Heller. When I contacted her on the Monday after Mr.
Heller told me that no investigation was going to be made, she
told me that my letter to the FBI had not been forwarded.  She
could not remember either the subject or the reason for declining
prosecution. If I could speculate on the conversation, Mr. Heller
may have told her he had a case he did not want to work on, and
her response may have been something like "Well, if you don't
want to work on it, the U.S. Attorney isn't interested." This is
hardly an independent evaluation of the merits of my complaint.
I then wrote to Michael Emick,  Ms. Sagar's boss. He is Chief  of
Criminal  Complaints  for  the  U.S.  Attorney's  Office  in  Los
Angeles. One  of Mr.  Emick's  assistants called  a week  or  two
later  and told me that virtually no cases except those involving
large amounts  of cocaine  are  being accepted  for  prosecution,
regardless of the merits.  I have received no written response to
my letter of April 25 to date (copy enclosed).
 
 
There may be a need  for remedial legislation on electronic  pri-
vacy.  Mr. Heller, a San Jose  FBI agent, and two representatives
of the District Attorney's office  in Riverside all believe  that
the requirements for obtaining warrants against individuals found
in 1986 law can  be safely ignored if  a warrant can be  obtained
against  the  computer on  which the  electronic mail  is stored.
They use the analogy  that if they obtained  a warrant against  a
Post  Office, they could open and read any mail they found within
the walls of  the Post  Office. I doubt  this was  the intent  of
 
 
Representative Norman Mineta   -2-                 July 31, 1988
 
 
Congress, but if it was, the fact would be of great interest in
this area.
 
In his closing sentence, Mr.  Clark recommends that I contact  an
attorney  to see what civil remedies  are available to me. I have
already contacted  several.  I find  that  while there  are  pro-
visions  (Section 2707) for  civil actions at  law, they are use-
less. If a  jury found  that my  privacy rights  had indeed  been
violated,  I  could  be  awarded  $1,000.  The  attorneys  I have
contacted tell me that  the case could be  made, and likely  won,
but  the cost to do so would  start at $100,000 and range upwards
of $500,000.
 
If this  were an  isolated incident,  I would  feel better  about
ignoring  the decay  of civil rights  in this  area. But recently
Riverside county officials  used a search  warrant to  confiscate
television news tapes in violation of federal and state laws pro-
tecting freedom of the  press.  Limits on law enforcement activi-
ties  are as important  as limits on criminals.  Although it is a
lot of trouble for a citizen  to oppose high handed law  enforce-
ment agents, it has to be done to prevent the loss of our rights.
 
I  would appreciate your inquiring of the Justice Department what
reasoning they used  to decline enforcing  the law Congress  made
regarding  electronic communications. Perhaps  they would respond
to a letter from you  in less than three  months. I know you  are
sensitive  to  shortcuts in due process, and I could use your ad-
vice on what, if anything, I should do.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
H. Keith Henson

     Your May 18th inquiry of the Department of Justice on behalf
of Mr. H. Keith Henson has been referred to FBI Headquarters.
 
     Mr. Henson's concerns have been reviewed both here and by
our Los Angeles Office.  The facts have been presented to the
United States Attorney's Office and prosecution was declined.
Mr. Henson has been advised of the declination and that our
investigation is closed.
 
     It has been suggested to Mr. Henson that he contact an
attorney of his choice to pursue possible civil remedies
available to him.

Dear Congressman Mineta:
 
 
 
     This is in response to your letter dated September 22, 1988,
 
on behalf of your constituent H. Keith Henson.
 
     The Unites States Attorney's office for the Central District
of California considered twice whether prosecution was warranted,
taking into account the information provided by Mr. Henson.
However, there is no competent evidence upon which to base a
federal prosecution.
 
     Since Mr. Henson's letter addresses a matter currently
being prosecuted by the State of California, this office
recommends that you refer Mr. Henson's inquiry to the District
Attorney's office, Los Angeles, California.
 
 
                                    Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Boyd:
 
 
 
Representative Norman Mineta passed on your undated letter to me
 
responding to his letter of September 22, 1988.
 
 
 
It is a violation of federal law (Title 18, Section 2701 et seq.)
 
to seize a person's electronic mail without a warrant against the
 
person's mail. My  electronic mail was  seized without a  warrant
 
being  sought against it. Could you  tell me how these simple-to-
 
determine facts fail to provide  "competent evidence on which  to
 
base  a federal prosecution." Could  you tell me what constitutes
 
"competent evidence" or provide a reference?
 
 
 
Could you clarify the last paragraph of your letter.  To the best
 
of  my knowledge  there is nothing  related to any  letter I have
 
written which  is "currently  being prosecuted  by the  State  of
 
California" by the District Attorney's office in Los Angeles.  If
 
there is, this would be of intense concern.
