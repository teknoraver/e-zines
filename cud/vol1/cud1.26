LEN ROSE UPDATE
+++++++++++++++++++
 
As of Friday, Aug. 3, Len Rose's case awaits trial in federal court in
Baltimore. According to one source, Len was offered an arrangement in which
he could plead guilty to one count of computer fraud and receive at least
some prison time, but would have his computer equipment returned, or take
the case to trial and take his chances.
 
Len is currently represented by a public defender because of lack of
resources to retain a specialist in computer crime cases.  He remains
unemployed, and has moved into a motel with his family.  He told us that,
because his equipment and crucial files were seized, his business was
essentially shut down and he was deprived of his livelihood. This means that
he not only cannot support his family, but cannot retain legal counsel of
his choice.  He said he was feeling isolated and "abandoned" and wasn't
sure what his legal options were.
 
We will present a detailed update of Len's situation in CuD 1.27.  Len's
public defender can be contacted at (301)-381-4646.

On March 1, 1990 the United States Secret Service raided the offices of
Steve Jackson Games (SJG) in Austin, Texas.  The raid was in conjunction
with an ongoing investigation into the activities of a computer underground
group known as the Legion Of Doom.  In the process of the raid at Steve
Jackson the agents seized files, computer equipment, and other assorted
materials, including the soon-to-be-released book entitled GURPS CYBERPUNK.
 
As of this writing (July 19, 1990) the majority of the material seized has
been returned, but the four month lag time cost the company much in revenue
and development time.  The financial impact has been said to have caused
lost income in the several thousand dollars range, and the layoff of nearly
half the SJG staff.  In spite of the difficulties of re-creating the book
from notes, draft copies, and comments from beta testers, SJG released
GURPS Cyberpunk approximately ten weeks ago.  Sales thus far have been
good, according to author Loyd Blankenship, and the reaction has been
positive to "the most realistic cyperpunk game on the market".
 
WHAT IS GURPS CYBERPUNK?
 
This "review" is being written for the purpose of exploring a book that was
confiscated, prior to publication, by the United States Secret Service. It
is not a critique of the book itself.  My intent is to discuss GURPS
Cyperpunk in a framework that examines what it contains in general, not in
specific, and most certainly not from the perspective a Role Playing Game
aficionado.  When the Secret Service confiscated GURPS Cyberpunk they
remarked it was actually a "handbook for computer crime" (p.5). Thus giving
us an excellent ideal-type by which we can (with tongue-in-cheek) define
the essential elements, if not the specific contents, of a government
identified "crime manual".
 
GURPS Cyberpunk is but one module of the General Universal Role Playing
System ("GURPS").  Role Playing Games (RPG) are complex simulations where
players role play the actions and persona of a character in a mythical
world.  Many RPG's are written for one specific setting, such as "Dungeons
and Dragons" (not a SJG product by the way) where play takes place in a
medieval world of magic, wizards, and (naturally) dragons.  GURPS, on the
other hand, is an award-winning system whereby nearly any type of world or
setting can be simulated based on the same set of GURPS rules and
guidelines.  GURPS Cyberpunk is a supplement to the GURPS Basic Set, giving
the players specific rules and background material needed to play a game
that takes place in a "cyperpunk" setting.
 
CYBERPUNK?
 
A discussion of "cyberpunk", as a genre and movement in and of itself,
would eclipse this review.  For our purposes we'll define cyberpunk as a
science fiction genre where the world is presented as gritty, corrupt, and
unfair, yet infused with rampant high technology being used for personal
and corporate gain.  Loyd Blankenship, the author of GURPS Cyberpunk and
managing editor at SJG, describes it like this:
 
     The cyberpunk future is vibrant - pulsating with life, from the
     streets to the high-rises. Paradoxically, however, that life is cheap,
     perhaps because there's so much of it - there might be twenty million
     people in Tokyo or New York.
 
     Cyberpunk is a style defined by two elements.  The first is
     interaction of man with technology. Computers are as common as
     dishwashers in the cyberpunk future, and the dividing line between man
     and machine is sometimes blurred....The second element found in most
     cyberpunk work is that of struggle. The world is divided into two
     groups - the haves and the have-nots - with a vast chasm between them.
     Those with power wish to keep it; those without, want to get it. (p.4)
 
In discussing the role playing aspects of a cyberpunk world Blankenship
writes:
 
     The conventional gaming morality of good versus evil has a limited
     role in the genre. What are the reference points? Characters in
     cyberpunk literature are constantly committing unethical, illegal or
     immoral acts, but they sometimes do so for purposes we could define as
     "good."  Conversely, a repressive government may define behavior as
     "good" that stifles the human spirit and grinds individuals into the
     dust. In cyberpunk, there are rarely blacks and whites, but there are
     many shades of gray. (pp.4-5)
 
If one considers GURPS Cyberpunk to be a literary work, rather than a
"mere" rule book for gaming, it becomes a valuable reference work for
exploring the cyberpunk genre.  Blankenship has even thoughtfully included
a selected bibliography of distinctive cyperpunk novels and movies. Those
interested in learning more about the cyberpunk future will find
bibliography quite helpful.
 
THE GURPS CYBERPUNK WORLD.
 
The book is divided into six sections, covering each element that the "Game
Master" (the person who, in essence, referees and directs the game for the
other players) should consider when planning his game or scenario.  These
sections, which will be discussed in turn, are:
 
        Characters Cyberwear Technology and Equipment Netrunning World
        Design Campaigning
 
CHARACTERS:
 
The inhabitants of the GURPS Cyberpunk world, and thus the personas players
can choose to adopt in game play, are many and varied.  Consistent with the
overall theme of the genre they primarily consist of low-life and/or
corrupt individuals interested mostly in personal gain.  Some of the
characters types discussed in the book include Assassins (which can be
associated with a particular mega-corporation or freelancers), Bodyguards,
Brokers (legitimate resellers, black marketeers, etc), Celebrities, Cops
(corrupt and otherwise), Corporate (good, bad, or indifferent the corporate
worker will always put company and career interests first. These characters
are also known as "suits"), Drifters, Mobsters, Reporters, and Slicers
(doctors who specialize in installing artificial supplements to the human
body. See "cyberwear" below).
 
There are many more roles and occupations that players can adopt.  The
GURPS Cyberpunk world is rich in options and offers something at every
level of social strata.
 
 
CYBERWEAR:
 
In the cyberpunk world science and medicine have met, mated, and forever
changed the meaning of "cosmetic surgery".  In this section the various
"optional equipment" players can purchase or obtain for their characters is
discussed. Cybernetic implants or replacement parts, such as eyes with
infrared or microscopic abilities, are available providing the player has
enough money and chutzpah to risk the surgery.  The cyberpunk body shops
offer everything from razor sharp retractable blades that fit under your
fingernails, to ROM chips and computer interfaces grafted directly onto the
cerebral cortex.  This section is a must read of "gadget freaks" of the
future!
 
TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT:
 
This section discusses the weapons (such as slugthrowers, lasers, and
grenades), equipment (such as ROM burners, batteries, vehicles), and drugs
(both legal and illegal), that are found in the game's world.  The
accessories found here are consistent with the overall theme, and in many
cases represent logical extensions of present day technology.
 
NETRUNNING:
 
The unifying concept of most Cyberpunk stories is the existence of a
world-wide computer network, know simply as "the net".  As GURPS Cyberpunk
points out, certainly the seeds for this network were already in place in
the late 1980's. The fact that so many of your are able to receive CuD on a
timely basis is testimony to this. GURPS Cyberpunk extrapolates the present
net into a future where it is a pervasive element of everyday life.
 
"Netrunners", the player characters who are specialists in the art of
penetrating the security of computers on the net, can be highly valued
members of the player team. The net and it's computers play such a large
role in the cyberpunk society that the skills of a "hacker" are often
needed to successfully complete a scenario.  (Other player character types
available are "console cowboys" or "interface jocks" who are essentially
netrunners-for-hire, plying their skills at freelance system penetration.)
 
Because so much of the cyberpunk future depends on computer interaction the
bulk of the "Netrunning" chapter is dedicated to describing the equipment
and layout of the net.
 
The computers described in GURPS Cyberpunk are futuristic, but not
unrealistically so.  They range from "dedicated computers" performing one
task, to "Megacomputers" which can control the traffic, sewage, power, and
all other maintenance functions for an entire city.
 
The net itself is, in some ways, much like the existing networks of today.
It consists of Government, Banking, Military, Educational, and Private
systems linked together through interconnections and gateways.  Three
different types of nodes are available for "jacking into" the net (public,
normal, and secure) with each protected (or not protected in some cases)
with various degrees of "ICE" (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics), the
security software of the future.
 
The net is accessed using a "cyberdeck", a small dedicated computer that
connects directly to the users neural system allowing the network and its
data to be visualized as it is transversed.  Thus when a netrunner is
jacked in she is virtually cut-off from the outside, totally immersed in
the experience of using the net.
 
For the netrunner, the visual experience of being "jacked in" is one where
the information is "seen" floating in space before ones eyes.  The image,
which is being electronically projected onto the optical nerve, can be one
of three styles. Marquee style, where all information appears in text form,
"Icon style" similar to the graphical user interface used in today's
machines, or "Environmental style" where the net appears to be a complete
and fully defined landscape with nodes, computers, and data appearing as
physical structures which can be entered and explored (perhaps somewhat
like that presented in the movie TRON).
 
If a Netrunner wishes to penetrate the ICE protecting a corporate computer
he can use one of several techniques which may (depending on luck and the
attributes or skills the character has) prove successful.  Some of the
techniques discussed in the GURPS manual include guessing passwords,
bluffing information out of inside sources (also known as "social
engineering"), and using specialized Cyberdeck programs to distract or
disable the security system.
 
If a Netrunner character successfully obtains access they must then take
actions to secure their goal...whatever that goal may be.  The GURPS
Cyberpunk manual includes a brief discussion of several things the player
may attempt such as copying or downloading information, monitoring other
users, remote execution of programs, and searching a database.  Note that
these discussions are quite brief, and merely explain in conceptual and
atmospheric terms what each action might entail.  For example, here are two
such sections in their entirety:
 
     Creating New Accounts: This can only be done from a superuser account.
     A fictitious entry is made in the system user file - the creator
     chooses whether to set it up as a normal account or as a superuser.
     Normal users are less powerful, but tend to attract less attention; a
     new superuser can do anything, but may be noticed quickly. If the
     netrunner can accomplish his goal with a normal account, or if he has
     confidence in his Promote program, he should stick with a standard
     account.  The decker should keep in mind that everything he does is
     probably being logged - unless he has a very trustworthy Erase
     program, he should plan on abandoning an account after using it for
     any noticeable scams.  Each week there is a chance that the fake
     account will be discovered by routine system administration. The GM
     [game master] should secretly roll 3d [dice] for each bogus account.
     If the machine is public a result of 4 or less indicates discovery;
     this increases to 6 or less on a normal machine and 8 or less on a
     secure machine. Increase these numbers by 2 if the fake account has
     superuser privileges.  Possible actions upon discovery range from
     simple deletion of the account to heavy Alarming and a Trace program.
     (pp.79-80)
 
     TRANSFERRING COMMODITIES: With the advent of electronic fund
     transfers, money is shuffled by communication lines instead of armored
     trucks. By shuffling the appropriate numbers a good netrunner can give
     himself "legitimate" access to millions of dollars in cash, precious
     metals, products or anything else that is used in commerce.
     Transferring commodities is simple - the exact appearance depends on
     the Environmental Interface being used [marquee, icon, etc. see above
     discussion], but the decker basically "picks up" the commodity with a
     Computer hacking roll [of the dice], and then "carries" it with him to
     another node, or uses a Transfer program to move it. What really
     happens is that he netrunner steals the routine codes and invoice
     number for the valuta, then erases them from the true owner's system.
     he must then arrange for delivery.  (p.82)
 
Other topics included in this chapter include detailed instructions on how
the GM can determine the structure of the network before the game begins by
using dice to randomly decide such things as number of nodes, contents of
the systems, complexity of the security, and so on.  This information is
later used in game play when a netrunner player attempts to access
individual nodes on the net.
 
Finally, throughout this chapter (and much of the book) there are numerous
"sidebar" articles containing background and supportive information which
is intended to add to the realism of the game.  The sidebar topics in this
chapter include a discussion of Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN),
Types of pseudonyms used by netrunners, Tempest surveillance equipment,
Data encryption, The Social Consequences of Neural Interfaces, Phreaking,
Strange Protocols, Trashing, and a list of current (1990) network names
around the world.  As an example here is the complete entry for "Chat
Systems":
 
    One of the most popular types of system on the net will be realtime
    conference centers - commonly called chat systems. These are nodes with
    a high number of incoming lines which allow users to communicate (both
    publicly and privately) with each other.  Hackers commonly use chat
    systems to discuss targets, or to trade information. The anger is that
    one is never sure of the identities of the other callers.  Hacker chat
    systems on current networks (such as Altgers or tchh in West Germany
    and QSD in France) have evolved elaborate protocols for hackers to deal
    with each other. These include the use of coded phrases to initiate
    conversation, avoidance of "real" names, and many other methods to
    ensure security.  The second danger of a chat system is that the users
    must trust the management.  Any time that a netrunner is using an
    unfamiliar chat system, the GM should roll 3d. On a 7 or less, the
    conversation is being monitored and possible recorded.  What happens
    after that is up to the GM. (p.69)
 
The other sidebar topics follow a similar pattern.  The topic is discussed
briefly, with some historical and a smattering of specific information
thrown in, then the specific instructions on how this information can be
incorporated into game play.
 
THE REST OF THE BOOK:
 
The remaining chapters in the book are "World Design" which discusses
considerations such as political climate, economic system, Urban Settings,
etc., and "Campaigning" which covers others items the GM will want to
consider such as setting the atmosphere, pace of the game, group dynamics,
and determining the theme.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
The bulk of this overview has focused on the "netrunning" chapter since it
is the information contained therein that the Secret Service was probably
most interested in.  Having placed the chapter within the framework and
intent of the book as a whole it become obvious that the discussion of
"hacking" is far from the instructional text book the government believed
it to be.  What GURPS Cyberpunk has done is to take a pre-existing science
fiction genre (cyberpunk) and create descriptions and guidelines that allow
role playing gamers to adopt accurate and realistic scenarios.
 
The question remains, however, if GURPS Cyberpunk has given away any
so-called "Secrets of the Computer Underground".  The answer is most
certainly that it has not.  Even the sidebar discussions about access
levels and backdoor programs reveal little more than "Superusers have the
most power of any account" and "Some programs may have secret passwords
that bypass regular system security".  Hardly information one couldn't
obtain from many other sources, including mainstream books on computer
security.
 
In fact, one group that may find this book to be helpful in the real world
is the computer security community.  Various members of the CU have often
suggested that computer facilities shred their trash, prohibit default
passwords, and other simple security measures.  If one concludes that this
is indeed a handbook for breaking into computers then it follows that it is
also a handbook on preventing hackers from doing so.
 
The audience of role playing games is a difficult crowd to please.
Successful games must offer excitement, intrigue, and logical consistency
in detail and rules.  As Blankenship noted while discussing GURPS
Cyberpunk, "A role playing game requires the suspension of disbelief.  The
closer a game is to reality the easier it is to suspend."  All things
considered, Steve Jackson Games has done an admirable job of bringing
realism and coherence to the cyberpunk world.
 
POSTSCRIPT:  Steve Jackson Games has set up a BBS for discussion and
questions about its products.  The Illuminati, once closed by the Secret
Service as a part of the raid on SJG, is now back online and awaiting your

***  CuD #1.26: File 3 of 5: Cyberspace & Real Life (M. Godwin)***
********************************************************************
 
Date: 29 Jul 90 06:30:19 GMT
To: alt-society-cu-digest@CS.UTEXAS.EDU
From: mnemonic@WALT.CC.UTEXAS.EDU(Mike Godwin)
Subject: Cyberspace Subculture in Real Life
 
I think it ought to be of particular interest to sf-lovers and other folks
interested in the interaction between technological advance and society
that Craig Neidorf, the major Legion of Doom defendant, had his case
discharged on Friday, when it became apparent that BellSouth, in their
eagerness to help the federal government, apparently contrived an
outrageously high valuation for the information that Neidorf and others are
alleged to have "stolen."
 
The case resonates with cyberpunk fiction for a couple of reasons.  The
first is obvious: the federal government's crackdown this winter and spring
has been aimed at stamping out an underground subculture of technically
proficient but non-mainstream computer hackers, a few of whom are genuinely
amoral, but all of whom are regarded by government and industry as
potential threats.
 
The second concerns the extend to which a corporate entity, BellSouth,
manipulated the government into terrorizing more than a hundred--and
intimidating thousands more--computer hobbyists. It's an exercise of
corporate dominance that an sf fan is tempted to describe as "Gibsonesque."
 
Has justice triumphed? Only in a sense. Neidorf had the advantage of being
the editor and publisher of PHRACK, which meant that his actions had First
Amendment implications that even the technophobes can understand. But even
with that advantage, it took a lot of effort to publicize the case, much of
which is attributable to John Barlow and Mitch Kapor of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, and Neidorf's family has been emotionally and
financially oppressed by the burden of his defense.
 
Nor is this the only social cost exacted by the federal crackdown; it's
also the case that countless BBSs and individual system owners have either
ended or limited public access to their systems for fear of having their
property seized as evidence.
 
Gibson's future is shaping itself right now, and it behooves those of us
who are interested in shaping that future to get involved right now.  Those
who are computer professionals should consider associating themselves with
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a group that has received
a grant from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. CPSR can be contacted by

which appears in the August issue of WHOLE EARTH REVIEW, and the Julian
Dibell article "On Line and Out of Bounds," which appears in the July 24
issue of the VILLAGE VOICE. There was a small newspaper article on the
dismissal of the Neidorf case in Saturday's NEW YORK TIMES; there should be
an article of some sort on the dismissal in Monday's issue of NEWSWEEK.

***  CuD #1.26: File 4 of 5: Update on RIPCO BBS & Dr. Ripco***
********************************************************************
 
Date:    Mon, 30 Jul 90 22:54 CDT
From:    Moderators (TK0JUT1.cs.niu.edu)
Subject: Update on RIPCO BBS and Dr. Ripco
 
 
One forgotten victim in the Sundevil sweeps has been Dr. Ripco, sysop of
RIPCO bbs, which was considered one of the top CU hangouts and text file
boards in the country. Dr. Ripco's equipment, including numerous disks,
several computers, and telecom equipment, was confiscated by Secret Service
agents with a seizure warrant on May 8. Although no computer-related
charges have been filed, no equipment has been returned.
 
When we caught up with DR a few days ago, he explained that local (Chicago)
police who accompanied federal agents on the seizures found several pistols
in the storage building where the computer equipment was located. Under a
Chicago ordinance, possession of weapons is a misdemeanor, and DR was cited
for failure to register the weapons.  The guns were new, never fired, and
still in their box.  If we caught the details correctly, he entered a
guilty plea, they took away the guns, and he was given six months
supervision and will not have a record.
 
The Doc indicated that he himself did not participate much in the modem
world, and one reason he has been silent is because he isn't fully aware of
all the digests and e-mail connections that exist, and depends for his news
on local media (good luck on that one, DR) and word-of-mouth from friends.
He has not yet retained an attorney to re-acquire his equipment, because he
believed it would be given back relatively soon. Now, nearly three months
after the seizure, he is concerned.
 
DR indicated that, unlike the experience of others, the SS was relatively
polite, if ignorant about technical matters. Although wearing bullet proof
vests, their guns were not drawn and they did not attempt to hassle him
(despite some snide comments by one agent).  He emphatically indicated that
the searches and confiscations were not necessary, because if they had
contacted him, he would have cooperated fully.
 
The Doc claimed that, to his knowledge, little illegal activity occured on
the board. He thought that perhaps some of his files might be considered
"bad taste," but they were not in his judgment illegal.  Public message
logs from mid-1988 to May 7, 1990, support his claim.  Despite some
posturing, few of the over 600 users abused the board.
 
In many ways, the situation is like that of Steve Jackson, whose equipment
was confiscated and board shut down because of some vague notion of
"possible wrong-doing."  RIPCO seems to have been targeted in part because
of its longevity and in part because it had one of the better text file
collection in country. It was a gathering point for many of the most active
computer underground types, and the number was reportedly blocked by at
least one telecom LD server because of phreaks calling.
 
If we are correct in our reasons for why RIPCO was shut down, it further
indicates the chilling effect of Sundevil. Providing textfiles as a
resource is not illegal, nor, to date, has the government claimed that Dr.
Ripco in fact did anything illegal.  Yet, his equipment is gone and the
modem world lost a fine board.
 
The moderators emphasize to those who think that RIPCO was nothing more
than a phreak/hacker board that it provided some of the best chat we have
seen. Discussions ranged from current events to sophisticated philosophical
issues. Despite the usual number of dolts one might expect in a community
of over 600, the users were generally well-informed, articulate, and
stimulating.
 
The closing of RIPCO is symbolic for two reasons.  First, as one of the
longest running CU boards, it served as a cultural meeting place.  The CU
community is transitory, with participants coming and going as their
interest fades and is rekindled.  RIPCO served as place to reunite old
friends and meet new ones.  Although most of the "elite" CU didn't frequent
RIPCO regularly, they would often "stop in" just to check their e-mail or
see what the latest text files were.  Thus, RIPCO was functional for
entering and maintaining contact with the CU community as a whole.
 
It is also interesting to note that RIPCO had long suffered under a sort of
"common knowledge" that it was highly "infested" with law enforcement
agents.  This assumption was fed both by it's longevity and openess to the
public.  When it was closed down, the general CU reaction was one of sorrow
(because it was such a familiar part of the community) and confusion
(because of its reputation for being legal and above board).  There was
also some question as to why the "feds" would shut down what was assumed to
be a source of information they were using to obtain leads into the
activity of the CU.
 
 
There is a chance that Dr. Ripco might resume the board, and we encourage
him to do so. RIPCO was an asset to the modem world and many of us miss it.
Dr. Ripco's account of his experience will appear in CuD 1.27.

***  CuD #1.26: File 5 of 5: The Current TAP (TAP Editors)  ***

TO: CuD Editors
FR: Aristotle, TAP Editor.
 
It had some to my attention that you may be confused about what TAP
Magazine is all about.  In this mail, I will aid you by explaining how TAP
came into our hands and why it is printed.  If you should have any further
questions, feel free to e-mail the address that this is sent from.
 
HOW WE CAME INTO PRINTING TAP.  Since the first time I came into the
techno-underground scene, I had always heard of a 'cool' magazine called
TAP in New York.  After searching for a set of issues, my friend and I came
into purchasing a complete set.  At that time I had been reading 2600 for
about three years and my friend and I agreed that what the
techno-underground needed was a publication (in hardcopy form), that would
print article concerning all corners of the techno-underground.  We liked
2600 and the other magazines (when they came out), but we just felt that
info on telephones and computers was not enough.  There are a multitude of
ways someone can hack.  To us, hacking computers, phones, cable systems,
satellite systems, and LIFE, were all equally interesting.  Well since
there was no current magazine that we knew of which dealt with all the
above things, we decided TAP had been the perfect magazine for the
situation.  After pondering on what we could do with it, we tried to
contact the last editors.  We admit that we did not get a hold of the past
editor until we had complete an issue, Number 92.  We did though, get in
touch with both Cheshire Catalyst and Tuc after our first issue was done.
Cheshire Catalyst was sent a copy for his 'approval' and he proceeded to
give us permission to resume TAP where he had left off.  Tuc expressed his
approval after seeing 92 and speaking with us at Summercon 89, in St.
Louis.  Cheshire, at first, decided he would let us print but he would not
openly admit that we had his permission until we were established as a
reputable publication.  Well, after we showed Tuc and Cheshire the
magazine, Cheshire gave his full cooperation with our production of TAP and
even offered some helpful words of wisdom on running TAP.  I am not going
to get into the debate of whether we are the original TAP, but I would like
to say that you could not get any closer to the original than we are.  TAP
never had one consistent editor.  Many people edited TAP and published it.
The way we see it is that we are just following in the footsteps of the
original editor.  I suppose you could call it a tradition, TAP WAS HANDED
DOWN TO ME PERSONALLY BY THE LAST EDITOR.
 
WHAT TAP IS ALL ABOUT.  TAP is printed for the sole purpose of promoting
the free distribution of useful information concerning the
techno-underground.  Every so often we will print articles concerning
politics or human rights but that is part of the flavor of TAP.  If we
decide that some info fits the format of the magazine, we print it.  The
staff of TAP has always believed in opposing any and all censorship.
 
SUBSCRIPTION RATES. One of the major reasons for our deciding to print TAP
was that there was a gaping hole in the market.  The only popular
hack/phreak publication that we could find was 2600.  With 2600 asking $18
for four issues, we felt something had to be done for the people that could
not afford something that expensive.  Therefore, we decided to give TAP
away.  Everyone should have the ability to access TAP.   Since TAP is free,
we also decided against copyrighting our magazine.  Anyone if free to copy
any part of TAP at their own free will.  The only thing we ask is that we
get credit in their reproduction for what we produced.  To get a copy of
TAP, all a subscriber has to do is send us a 25 cent stamp to cover
postage.  We will pay all other costs.  The price might go up to 50 cents
soon as we are using larger envelopes which cost more to mail.  If someone
wants to get a subscription, he/she only needs to send the correct amount
of postage for the amount of issues he/she wants to receive.  We like to
get subscriptions in lots of 10 or less issues.  Anything over 10 issues is
considered a donation.  Back issues of all 100 issues are also being
offered now.  These will cost actual money.
