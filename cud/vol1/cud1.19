This issue is the concept outline of one section of a paper to be submitted
to the Midwest Sociological Society's annual meetings in 1991 and will
ultimately be submitted for publication. The intent of the paper is to
develop a discourse analysis of how "social facts" are given "legal
meanings." The saliency of the current crackdown on alleged "computer
crime" seems an excellent way of tapping the clash between new meanings and
old definitions, and how courts become the battlefield for over these
meanings.
This draft is not copy-protected and may be used as appropriate.
The prose and ideas here remain tentative and incomplete,  and will be refined.
It is circulated for conceptual, theoretical, and bibliographic

      THE SECRET SERVICE, E911, AND LEGAL RHETORIC:
                  MALICE IN WONDERLAND?
 
   "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful
   tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor
   less."
 
   "The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean
   so many different things."
 
   "The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be
   master--that's all" (Carroll, 1981: 169).
 
 
  Law is more than simply assuring public order.  It is also, as White (1984)
  argues,  "action with words."   The rhetoric of law is played  out in the
  drama of the courtroom,  and the denouement of the play is scripted by the
  language of statutory  and case law,  indictments,  and the  talk of the
  courtroom performers (Nichols, 1990; Thomas, 1983, 1989).
 
                          - 1 -
 
 
  Part of this  language game involves a battle  over competing definitions,
  meanings,  and  nuances that may be  unrelated to "facts,"  and instead
  replaces facts with rhetoric,  or a style of persuasion.   The language of
  indictments and how evidence is presented provides one window through which
  to observe this rhetorical battle.   Indictments  are the means by which a
  "bad act" is  transformed into a formally sanctionable  one by creatively
  linking the act to the law that it ostensibly violates.   A recent federal
  indictment of an alleged computer hacker provides on example (U.S. v.  Rigs
  and Neidorf, 90-CR-0070, Northern District of Illinois,  Eastern Division).
  (For a background on the issues involved,  see especially Barlow,  (1990),
  Denning, (1990), Goldstein, (1990), Markoff, (1990), and Schwartz (1990).
 
  This outline is divided into two parts.  Section one first presents formal
  "indictment talk" and that to which  it speaks.  The second section,  not
  included here, will provide a semiotic/deconstructionist analysis.
 
  The indictment begins with a degradation game, one in which the credibility
  and character of  the defendant is attacked because of  a presumed deviant
  behavior and association with deviant groups.    The goal is to stigmatize
  hackers such  that prejudicial meanings are  imposed.   It is  a clever
  linguistic trick that  creates a tautology that defines the  guilt of the
  defendant by  recursing  back to the allegation in a  manner that produces
  linguistic "evidence  of guilt."  This would  be analogous to  calling an
  alleged murder a "murderer" in court,  rather than requiring that the label
  must first be demonstrated to be true.  In short,  the "thing" becomes the
  "name:"
                          - 2 -
 
 
 
 5.   _Computer Hackers_ - As used here, computer hackers are
  individuals involved  with the unauthorized access  of computer
  systems by various means.    Computer hackers commonly identify
  themselves by aliases or "hacker handles" when communicating with
  other hackers.
 
  The rhetoric first attempts to transform the conventional and broader image
  of "hacker" into  one that is malignant  in a way that  will allow anyone
  associated with the label to be, by definition,  stigmatized as a criminal.
  Yet,  there is considerable evidence that  the term does not,  in itself,
  refer to  an illegal activity,  and  that many who  consider themselves
  "computer hackers" do not engage in computer trespass, whether unauthorized
  or not.
 
  The assumption that all computer hackers  are intent on committing criminal
  trespass or fraud  distorts the nature of the activity.    Only the most
  extreme examples come to the attention of law enforcement officials and the
  public, and this obscures the complexity both of hacking and of the CU.  In
  its broadest sense,   hacking is the dual process of  obtaining and using
  sufficient mastery  of computers and programs  to allow resolution  of a
  computer problem for which no previous knowledge or guidance exists.   The
  Hacker's Dictionary, a text file widely circulated on BBSs,  provides this
  definition:
 
 
                          - 3 -
 
 
          HACKER {originally,  someone who makes furniture with an axe} n.
          1.  A  person who enjoys  learning the details  of programming
          systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
          users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
          programs enthusiastically,  or who enjoys programming rather than
          just theorizing about  programming.   3.  A person  capable of
          appreciating hack value (q.v.).   4.  A  person who is good at
          programming quickly.  Not everything a hacker produces is a hack.
          5.  An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does
          work using it or on it; example: "A SAIL hacker".  (Definitions 1
          to 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)  6.  A
          malicious  or  inquisitive  meddler who  tries  to  discover
          information by poking around.   Hence "password hacker", "network
          hacker".
 
  A computer programmer's attempt to help a  colleague enter a system when a
  password has  been lost or  forgotten,  de-bugging a  copyright software
  program,  or testing a system's security  are examples for which a benign
  form of hacking is both required and considered acceptable.   Nonetheless,
  this deceptive definition was successful,  for it convinced Judge Nicholas
  Bua that the prosecutor's definition was the most common, would be unlikely
  to confuse a jury,  and was not  prejudicial (See Memorandum Order in CuD
  1.16).
 
  Another rhetorical ploy in this same passage  is the attempt to connect the
  use of aliases with deviant activity.   Pseudonyms are widely used on BBSs,
  and their use reflects a cultural  practice including,  but hardly limited
  to, members of the computer underground.   Yet,  clever rhetorical twists
  distort the cultural  meaning and impute to  it one totally at  odds with
  reality by playing  on the myth that pseudonyms reflect  attempts to hide
  "bad acts."
 
                          - 4 -
 
 
  A third rhetorical  ploy in this section of the  indictment associates the
  defendant with a loosely connected group  known as "Legion of Doom," which
  was a small  collection of people who shared  technical knowledge between
  themselves and others.   Without presenting any evidence whatsoever,  and
  without citing an indictment, on-going case, or justifying the claims,  the
  indictment asserts  that the  group was "closely  knit" and  involved in
  disrupting telecommunications,   bank fraud and other  serious felonious
  behavior.   Because  of its amorphous  nature and  ambiguous boundaries
  defining "affiliation," the  indictment's language offers little  means to
  resist the imposition of its "legal meaning:"
 
        6.    _Legion of  Doom_ - As used here the  Legion of Doom
        (LOD) was a closely knit group of computer hackers involved in:
          a.   Disrupting telecommunications by entering
               computerized telephone switches and changing
               the routing on the circuits of the computerized
               switches.
          b.  Stealing proprietary computerized information
              from companies and individuals.
          c.  Stealing and modifying credit information on
              individuals maintained in credit bureau
              computers.
          d.  Fraudulently obtaining money and property from
              companies by altering the computerized
              information used by the companies.
          e.  Sharing information with respect to their
              methods of attacking computers with other
              computer hackers in an effort to avoid law
              enforcement agencies and telecommunication
              experts from focusing on them, alone.
 
 
                          - 5 -
 
 
  The indictment itself focuses on the  alleged "theft" and dissemination of
  an E911 document from Bell South. Although those close to the case indicate
  that only a small portion of a training document was at issue, the language
  of the indictment  attempts to link this document and  its possession and
  dissemination to severe threats to the commonweal:
 
          22.         It was further part of the scheme that on or about
        February 24,  1989 defendant NEIDORF  disseminated the disguised E911
        text file in issue 24 of "PHRACK" newsletter.
 
          23.         It  was further  part of  the scheme  that the
        defendant NEIDORF would disseminate and  disclose this information to
        others for their  own use,  including to other  computer hackers who
        could use  it to  illegally manipulate  the emergency  911 computer
        systems in the United States and  thereby disrupt or halt 911 service
        in portions of the United States.
 
  Such rhetoric  raises the spectre of  people dying,  and one  news story
  actually wrote that there  was no evidence of any deaths  as the result of
  the behavior,  thus re-inforcing the apparent danger to the public.   The
  rhetoric sounds serious.  But, what in fact is the evidence?   The PHRACK
  file reprinted here is as it appeared in the original issue. The indictment
  indictates it is the same as the one that has been stolen,  because it has
  been "edited," "retyped," and "disguised."

E911 - Enhanced 911:  Features available include selective routing,
       selective transfer, fixed transfer, alternate routing, default
       routing, Automatic Number Display, Automatic Location
       Identification, night service, default routing, call detail
       record.
 
End Office - Telephone central office which provides dial tone to the
             subscriber calling 911.  The "end office" provides ANI
             (Automatic Number Identification) to the tandem office.
 
Tandem Office - Telephone central office which serves as a tandem (or
                hub) for all 911 calls.  Must be a 1AESS type of
                central office.  The tandem office translations
                contain the TN/ESN relationships which route the 911
                call to the proper SAP.  The tandem office looks up
                the ANI (TN) that it receives from the end office and
                finds the ESN (routing information) which corresponds
                to a seven digit number ringing in at a PSAP.
 
PSAP - Public Safety Answering Point, usually the police, fire and/or
       rescue groups as determined by the local municipalities.  A
       "ringing" will not have ANI or ALI capabilities, but just
       receives calls or transferred calls from another PSAP.
 
ESN - Emergency Service Number (XXX) that is assigned to the
      subscriber's telephone number in the tandem office translations
      The ESN represents a seven digit number by which the tandem
      office routes the call to the proper PSAP.  PSAPs with ALI
      capabilities also receive a display of the ESN information which
      shows which police, fire and rescue agency serves the telephone
      number calling 911.  An ESN is a unique combination of police,
      fire, and rescue service for purposes of routing the E911 call.
 
ANI - Automatic Number Identification corresponds to the subscriber's
      seven digit telephone number.  The ANI displays at the PSAP on
      the digital ANI display console.
 
ALI - Automatic Location Identification provides for an address
      display of the subscriber calling 911.  With ALI, the PSAP
      receives the ANI display and an ALI display on a screen.  The
      ALI display includes the subscriber's address, community, state,
      type of service and if a business, the name o the business.  The
      PSAP will also get a display of the associated ESN information
      (police, fire, rescue).
 
Selective Routing - The capability to route a call to the particular
                    PSAP serving the address associated with the TN
                    making the 911 call.  Selective routing is
                    achieved by building TN/ESN translations in the
                    tandem central office.  These translations are
                    driven by the E911 data base which assign the ESN
                    to each telephone number based on the customer's
                    address.  Service order activity keeps the E911
                    data base updated.  The E911 data base, in turn,
                    generates recent change to the tandem office
                    (through the SCC or RCMAC) to update the TN/ESN
                    translations in the tandem data base.
 
Selective Transfer - Provides the PSAP with the ability to transfer
                     the incoming 911 call to a fire or rescue service
                     for the particular number calling 911 by pushing
                     one button for fire or rescue.  For example, if
                     an incoming 911 call was reporting a fire, the
                     PSAP operator would push the fire button on the
                     ANI console; the call would go back to the tandem
                     office, do a lookup for the seven digit number
                     associated with fire department, for the ESN
                     assigned to the calling TN, and automatically
                     route the call to that fire department.  This
                     differs from "fixed" transfer which routes every
                     call to the same fire or rescue number whenever
                     the fire or rescue button is pushed.  The PSAP
                     equipment is optioned to provide either fixed or
                     selective transfer capabilities.
 
Alternate Routing - Alternate routing provides for a predetermined
                    routing for 911 calls when the tandem office is
                    unable to route the calls over the 911 trunks for
                    a particular PSAP due to troubles or all trunks
                    busy.
 
Default Routing - Provides for routing of 911 calls when there is an
                  ANI failure.  The call will be routed to the
                  "default" ESN associated with the he NNX the caller
                  is calling from.  Default ESNs are preassigned in
                  translations and are usually the predominant ESN for
                  a given wire center.
 
Night Service - Night service works the same as alternate routing in
                that the calls coming into a given PSAP will
                automatically be routed to another preset PSAP when
                all trunks are made busy due to the PSAP closing down
                for the night.
 
Call Detail Record - When the 911 call is terminated by the PSAP
                     operator, the ANI will automatically print-out on
                     the teletypewriter located at the PSAP.  The
                     printout will contain the time the call came into
                     the PSAP, the time it was picked up by an
                     operator, the operator number, the time the call
                     was transferred, if applicable, the time the call
                     was terminated and the trunk group number
                     associated with the call.  Printouts of the ALI
                     display are now also available, if the PSAP has
                     purchased the required equipment.
 
ANI Failure - Failure of the end office to identify the call and
              provide the ANI (telephone number) to the tandem office;
              or, an ANI failure between the tandem office and the
              PSAP.
 
Misroute - Any condition that results in the 911 call going to the
           wrong PSAP.  A call can be misrouted if the ESN and
           associated routing information are incorrect in the E911
           data base and/or tandem data base.  A call can also be
           misrouted if the call is an ANI failure, which
           automatically default routes.
 
Anonymous Call - If a subscriber misdials and dials the seven digit
                 number associated with the PSAP position, they will
                 come in direct and ANI display as 911-0000 which will
                 ALI as an anonymous call.  The seven digit numbers
                 associated with the PSAP positions are not published
                 even to the PSAPs.
 
Spurious 911 Call - Occasionally, the PSAP will get a call that is not
                    associated with a subscriber dialing 911 for an
                    emergency.  It could be a subscriber who has not
                    dialed 911, but is dialing another number, or has
                    just picked up their phone and was connected with
                    the PSAP.  These problems are equipment related,
                    particularly when the calls originate from
                    electromechanical or step by step offices, and are
                    reported by the E911 Center to Network Operations
                    upon receipt of the PSAP inquiry reporting the
                    trouble.  The PSAP may get a call and no one is
                    there; if they call the number back, the number
                    may be disconnected or no one home Again these are
                    network troubles and must be investigated.
                    Cordless telephones can also generate "spurious"
                    calls in to the PSAPs.  Generally, the PSAP will
                    hear conversation on the line, but the subscribers
                    are not calling 911.  The PSAP may report spurious
                    calls to to repair if they become bothersome, for
                    example, the same number ringing in continually.
 
No Displays - A condition where the PSAP ALI display screen is blank.
              This type of trouble should be reported immediately to
              the SSC/MAC.  If all screens at the PSAP are blank, it
              is an indication that the problem is in the circuits
              from the PSAP to the E911 computer.  If more than one
              PSAP is experiencing no display, it may be a problem
              with the Node computer or the E911 computer.  The
              SSC/MAC should contact the MMOC to determine the health
              of the HOST computer.
 
Record Not Found - If the host computer is unable to do a look up on a
                   given ANI request from the PSAP, it will forward a
                   Record Not Found message to the PSA ALI screen.
                   This is caused by service order activity for a
                   given subscriber not being processed into the E911
                   data base, or HOST computer system problems whereby
                   the record cannot be accessed at that point in time.
 
No ANI - This condition means the PSAP received a call, but no
         telephone number displayed on the ANI console.  The PSAP
         should report this condition immediately to the SSC/MAC.
 
PSAP Not Receiving Calls - If a PSAP cannot receive calls or request
                           retrieval from the E911 host computer,
                           i.e., cable cut, the calls into that PSAP
                           must be rerouted to another PSAP.  The
                           Switching Control Center must be notified
                           to reroute the calls in the tandem office
                           E911 translations.
 
MSAG - Master Street Address Guide.  The MSAG ledgers are controlled
       by the municipality which has purchased the E911 ALI service,
       in that they assign which police, fire or rescue agency will
       serve a given street an number range.  They do this by
       assigning an ESN to each street range, odd, even, community
       that is populated in the county or municipality served.  These
       MSAGs are then used as a filter for service order activity into
       the E911 computer data base to assign ESNs to individual TN
       records.  This insures that each customer will be routed to the
       correct agency for their particular address.  In a non-ALI
       County, TAR codes are used by the Telephone company to assign
       ESNs to service conductivity and the County does not control
       the ESN assignment.  TAR codes represent the taxing authority
       for the given subscriber which should correspond to their
       police, fire and rescue agencies.  The MG method, of course, is
       more accurate because it is using the actual service address of
       the customer to route the call and provides the county with
       more flexibility in assigning fire and rescue district, etc The
       Customer Services E911 Group maintains the E911 computer data
       base and interfaces with the County (customer) on all MSAG or
       data base activity.

  What in fact is this document?  It  is simply a partial glossary available
  from other sources,  and hardly of  any technical value.   It presents 22
  terms, six of which are found in at least one public book (e.g.,  Ambrosch,
  Maher and Sasscer,  1989),  and the rest found either in the text of that
  work (see esp.  Chapter 9) or readily found elsewhere.   Further, if this
  document can be deciphered as potentially  dangerous,  then what is one to
  make of the Amborsch,  Maher and  Sasscer volume itself,  which not only
  provides several hundred definitions,  but also includes detailed technical
  information and  diagrams about  the operation,   administration,  and
  functioning of Bell systems? There is nothing in the PHRACK document, or in
  any of the  so-called "phreak/hacker" magazines that is  not available in
  more detail from any work found in the classroom or library.
 
  A cursory reading  of Ambrosch,  Maher,  and  Sasscer (1989)  provides
  references to many of these definitions,  and  we have seen others in the
  "chat" section of public BBSs.   Below we provide a sample of terms readily
  available to the public.  Those without a reference are either common terms
  or are readily deducible from the referenced items:

  Despite the  banality of these  terms,  the indictment's  discourse was
  sufficiently clever to convince Judge Bua  that the information was indeed
  "valuable," and "confidential," and despite  its public availability,  is
  "property" that deprives Bell South of "something of value."  However,  the
  judge seems  taken in  by the chicanery  of the  prosecutor's linguistic
 
                         - 15 -
 
 
  distortion that  manipulates the symbols of  PHRACK's style to  create an
  alternative reality that is, at best, questionable.  Consider, for example,
  the following passage.   First assume it appears in  a scholarly article
  explaining the basic service of E911:
 
        With the non-IN  Emergency Response Service (ERS),   the caller
        dials a special  emergency number (very short,   usually three
        digits) which is uniform within a country, (for example,  911 in
        the USA, and in West Germany 110/0110 for police and 112/0112 for
        fire or ambulance) (Ambrosch, Maher and Sasscer, 1989: 162).
 
  Now, re-frame the same passage, but preface it with a sentence like:   "At
  the last hackers'  convention,  Holly Hackwood described  the E911 basic
  service like this:  (and now re-read  the passage)."  Is the E911 document
  illegal when published in PHRACK (for that is what the indictment charges),
  but legal when published in a library book or a research paper?   The point
  is that it  is not only possession  of public information that  is being
  prosecuted, but the manner in which the symbols are packaged.
 
  In CuD 1.17,  we cited a California law  that makes it a felony to merely
  POSSESS certain types of information,  whether that information is used or
  communicated to others or not.  The "crime" of the "hacker" seems to be not
  only possession of information freely available to the public,  but also of
  presenting  relatively innocuous  information in  the  discourse of  an
  anti-establishment ethos.   More simply, the "crime" is that of speaking a
  different language  than law enforcement  officials who seem  willing to
  distort that language with rhetorical ploys of their own.

  White (1984) suggest that, in legal discourse,  "words lose their meaning"
  and that  law is as much  a language game  as it is the  application of
  statutes and cases  to behavior.   The resulting danger  is that language
  becomes a weapon to subvert freedom of speech.  In an era when most people
  are not "culturally literate" in the nuances of techno-speak,  the ease of
  distortion puts defendants at risk in bench  or jury trials where a common
  framework of meaning is intentionally obscured  in the battle over symbolic
  terrain.   In the next  section the language of law as  reflected in the
  indictment will be  "deconstructed," and the logic and  imagery made more
  apparent.
