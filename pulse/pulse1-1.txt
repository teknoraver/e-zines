"Your UNIX Services"

Some people consider the etc directory to be the most important thing in thier
lives. This can be very true if you haven't found out about women, drugs,
alcohol, good music and buddism.(Well I haven't ever met a Buddist UNIX
Maven). 

However, nowadays, it's not just the passwd or opasswd files that we are 
interested in. The file I'll discuss now is /etc/services. The services file is
one of the most important files that a machine on the net has, unfortunately it
is constantly overlooked by the casual browser.

So, what's so good about the services file? huh?

Well the services file contains the portmap for any UNIX system on the Net.

Here is a heavily edited sample of an /etc/services file: (due to size and
some other less significant reasons... ;) )

It goes on and on

Pretty ain't it!?! To explain what each and every one of these ports did would
literally take for ever, luckily most of them are fairly self-explainitory. 

Anywayz, to realise the potential of this document u must first understand that 
in all cases here, for a port to be active, someone or something must be 
running a daemon or process which will create the port. The /etc/services is 
merely a map as to what number the port should be for which process.

For example:

The finger daemon uses p 79, unless the finger daemon (fingerd) is running
(run by root), that port won't exist and the machine will refuse aby
attempted connections to that port number. However it is still listed in
the services folder in case it is run.

(Many net nodes have shut down their fingerd, for sekurity reasons.
However if you are on the machine, and have the right shell ax-s, you can
still run the fingerd because it doesn't need to create an externally
accessable port.) 
 
How to use this info:
To connect to a port on a machine is easy to initiate, u just telnet there, for
example, this should give you the time:

/>telnet 127.0.0.1 37


Are there any /etc/services alternatives: 
There used to be TCPMAP utilites, however they are mostly disabled these days,
for "sekurity reasons". 

Official NcP /etc/services Tour Of Duty:

"News Hack."

    Okay here's how to post a news item without anyone being able to tell you
posted it.. You can also make it appear someone else posted it too, that way the
lamer will cop any flames your newspost causes.

#    First step is to create a file in you home dir.

touch kcahswen

#    Then edit this file.

vi kcahswen

#    Put in the following headings

From: Eddie Vedder
Newsgroups: alt.binaries.warez.ibm-pc alt.test
Subject: ALiVE
Message-Id: <pearl.jam@your.domain.gov>

#    Now leave a blank line and enter the body of your post.

Oh she walks slowly, across a young man's room.
She says "I'm ready... to fuck you"
Now I can't remember anything to this very day.
Except love..

# Obviously after the From: heading you should stick in who you want the message
# to have appeared to have been posted by.
# In the Newsgroups area you put in the names of the newsgroups you wanna post 
# to.
# For the Subject: you simply stick in your subject..
# and for message-id you put in the id for whoever you want.. the account DOES
# NOT have to be a real account.. but it should be from your site... (ie if you
# are doing this from netcom then stick in <user@netcom.com>

# okay..  save that and then have to find the binary inews on your particular
# machine... It's usually in the /usr/bin/news directory.. but it may be 
# different on your site.. Once you've found it then from that path type.

inews /home/username/kcahswen

# Where /home/username is your home workspace. ($W)
# And the message is away...
# This method is much safer than simply tweaking your news configuration..
# Happy hacking.. and be sure topost a binary on a.b.w.i..

"Mail Phraud"

SMTP spoken here

Any external connections to a net.node require the use of a port. This file 
explains a simple method by which almost any net.user can use the basic 
functions of port 25 to their advantage. Port 25 is the mail port. (e-mail). 
This is only a sample file, as to how this trick might be performed. This 
information is not actually meant to be used.

#type this:
/> telnet
telnet> open victim.com 25

# Where victim.com is the victims machine (must be running sendmail daemon.)
#This should appear:

Trying......
Connected to victim.com 
Escape character is '^]'
220 victim.com Sendmail AIX 4.1/UCB 5.64/4.03 ready at Wed,
xx Mar 199x 12:08:36 -0x00

#x's inserted by me! ;)
#Then u type this:

mail from:faker@faker.com

#this will send the mail from: faker@faker.com (phunny that...) insert your own
#version.
#you should get this back:

250 faker@faker.com... Sender is valid.

#Next u define the recipient (person who gets the mail).
#This has to be a real address, it checks. (not much point in sending it 
#otherwise either)

rcpt to:victim@victim.com

#it replies:

250 victim@victim.com... Recipient is valid.

#Cool, now for the mail message, type 'data' , then press return. Now enter the
#mail message, you can't go back up a line however, so be careful or you'll 
#have to re-start:

data
354 Enter mail. End with the . character on a line by itself.
This is only a Test.
.

#It'll say:

250 Ok

#Now, it's time to say goodbye.
#You type:

quit

221 victim.com: closing the connection.
Connection closed.

telnet> 

Other p25 functions:

Of all the other SMTP functions, the two most useful are EXPN and VRFY, or
expand and verify. These two commands simply enable you check on a users 
existence and mail aliases:

expn user1
250 Mr_K-rad <user1>

Also, always remember, if u get stuck, or want to try something else, type 
HELP, most sendmail versions even have help on help:

help help
214-Usage: HELP [Topic]
214-The HELP command gives help info.
214 End of HELP information

Hmmmmm.

Q: How traceable is fake-mail?
A: This is exactly how traceable fake-mail is: (where real.site.com is 
the REAL machine used to send the mail )

Things to notice here are that they have the actual sitename that u bounced 
the mail off, so if u intend to send death threats to someone, u can actually 
be traced back over numerous system logs to your mail alias and login times, 
if u aren't careful (and if ESMTP isinvolved).

"ESMTP spoken here"

If you see this, then u have witnessed the end of an era. ESMTP is the new and
improved SMTP, it sends your domain name regardless of whom you tell it the 
mail is from. Look out for NcP solutions to this problem coming to a release 
near you.

"IRC Hack"


	This  hack allows you to enter irc as any user (either real or
completely fabricated) from your domain. This is good if you know someone
from your site is auto-oped by a bot.. or is on someone's friend-list.
You just pretend to be them and get the opz... anyway.. here's how.

	This is another application of telneting to selected ports.

###
# from your shell..

telnet

open irc.domain.com 6667

# where irc.domain.com is the irc server you would like  to hack.. ie
# jello.qabc.uq.edu.au ... then whenyou have connected to port 6667..

USER dexter@offspring.com.au 0 0: Dexter BSc

# depending on what sort of identd your machine and the irc server use
# this will tell irc that either you are dexter@offspring.com.au or
# dexter@your.domain. With Jello it is of the latter version.

nick DeXTeR

# The irc server will now talk to you.. giving you information about the
# server  status. Youare now using  RAW irc.

join #channel

# with raw irc  you don'thave to /  before a command.. in fact you CAN'T
# /command. If you wanna say something then you have to privmsg it to the
# channel.

privmsg #warez opz!?!

# you can op others and use mostother commands normal irc uses..
# youjusthave to get used to this  raw form.

mode #warez +o NcP-BoT

notice #warez ^B Packs Offered:^B

kick #warez MiND-9 ^BNarc^B

# etc.. enjoy.

# This may not work on SOME servers.. there is this evil thing called an
# identd which identifies you to the irc server. It can be hacked but it's a
# long and slow process (see future editions) People with no identd get a ~
# before their username (ie ~dexter@offspring.com.au) and this helps irc ops
# and chops identify us hackers..  but windblows irc clients and amiga irc
# clients are yet to support identd.. so this hack is still applicable.

"NcP News"
Mar/Apr 95

-----OXYGEN MEMBERS IN JAIL!!!-------------------------------------------

	Yes, two of oxygen's former whq sysops are currently in jail on
phone fraud charges along with other charges.. such as the possesion of
illegal narcotics.

	Unique-1 and X-Cell were arrested on the afternoon of Tuesday the
28th of March on phone fraud charges.. the police also found trips and
dope on them and these charges were added after the arrest.
	
	The trial is on the 18th of April.

	Unique-1 (17) and X-Cell (18 - Formerly known as Refract) are
charged with using $148,000 worth of phree phone calls by manipulating
telephone exchanges and boxing tones.. Both were under 18 when the 'crime'
was commited so they're pretty safe.. but it's a warning to phreakers.

	X-Cell (refract) was the sysop of Digital Dreams BBS.. one of the
fastest and most elite BBS's in the state.. he was also the guy who helped
me out quite a bit when I was first starting out with the elite scene.. I
did some favours for him.. plugged a few security leaks in his system..
and he gave me a disabled ratio.. we smoked some drugs together.. we were
mates... Good luck man... and remember to say "Sir, I have no clear
recollection of those events" lots.

	Unique-1 was a founding member of the super-elite OXYGEN and also
the sysop of The Rave System. Another fast warez and hpavc board here..
probably more exclusive than any other. I fondly remember phonecalls
(phreaked of course) from him where he would offer me bulbz and threaten
to come over and rape my cat if I didn't come down to Zone-3 and do some
bulbz with him.

	Good luck. And don't sell out.
