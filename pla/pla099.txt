        Here it is kiddies.  What you have been waiting for.  The gnu PLA and
guess what.  It isn't written by that looser redb0xchillipepper mainly because
i felt like fucking writing.  If you have a problem with it then go and harass
someone because i really don't care.  So without further adieu here is the
lamest PLA to date (well maybe that one about hacking bbs's was gayer).
Oh and the reason this is pla099.txt is just because i wanted to confuse
you and make your little puny brain hurt.

|The Granite City Waffle House Harassment (just unprovoked good harassment)
|______________________________________________________________________________

<cashier>Granite City Waffle House
<dhate> Yea what kind of waffle's do you guys have?
<cashier>Regular and pecan waffle's sir.
<dhate>What's the difference?
<cashier>One has Pecan nuts and the other doesn't
<dhate>How much is a pecan waffle?
<cashier>$1.75 sir
<dhate>$1.75 for a fucking waffle!!?
<cashier>yes sir one pecan waffle is $1.75
<dhate> that better be one big fucking waffle
<cashier> It's slighty larger then a regular waffle sir
<dhate> you guys don't put bourbon or anything like that in it?
<cashier> Nope, just pecans sir.
<dhate> what kind of pecans?
<cashier> well, uh, i don't know sir.  Just regular pecans i think
<dhate> you are charging me $1.75 and you don't know what kind of pecans are
in it?
<cashier> maybe you should talk to the chef sir
<dhate> yea i think so too
        The cashier goes and gets linda<the chef> and me and zak are just
busting up laughing the whole time.
<linda> hello?
<dhate> Hi, what kind of pecans do you put in your pecan waffles?
<linda> Just run of the mill pecans
<dhate> you don't pay some mexican to pick them in brazil or anything?
<linda> no sir, just regular pecan nuts
<dhate> well how do i know that the pecan nuts you are serving are sanitary?
<linda> sir you have my guarantee, all of our food is clean.
<dhate> how do i know you didn't shoot those pecan nuts out your clit?
<linda> sir i think that's kinda disgusting
<dhate> well i want to be sure i am getting sanitary pecan nuts.  After all I
am paying $1.75 for one god damn waffle
<linda> sir i assure you the waffle's are clean
<dhate> well i don't believe you
<linda> i'm sorry to hear that sir
<dhate> if i bring in my own pecan nuts, could you cook me up some waffles
using those?
<linda> sir we can't do that
<dhate> why the fuck not?
<linda> it's against policy
<dhate> yea but my pecan nuts are sanitary and i don't think yours are.
<linda> sir i'm sorry but you can't bring in your own nuts
<dhate> ARE YOU SAYING MY NUTS ARE UNSANITARY!?
<linda> no sir i'm not, it's just against policy
<dhate> SO YOU ARE SAYING MY NUTS ARE UNSANITARY AREN'T YOU?!
<linda> *sigh*, no sir i didn't say that
<dhate> WHY ARE MY NUTS UNSANITARY?
<linda> (getting just a tad bit pissed) sir i did NOT say that, i just can't
let you bring in pecan nuts
<dhate> SO WHY DO YOU THINK MY NUTS ARE UNSANITARY?!
<linda> SIR I DIDN'T SAY YOUR FUCKING NUTS WERE UNSANITARY YOU LITTLE FUCKHEAD
AND I DON'T THINK YOUR VERY FUNNY AT ALL.
<dhate> I DEMAND TO KNOW WHY MY NUTS ARE UNSANITARY!
<linda> (Linda kinda went nuts after that.  I heard a bunch of nawty werds and
her yelling with other employees.  She was yelling so loud me and zak heard
some one tell her to shut up and then we hung up.)

        After a lot of calling up the waffle house and yelling "MY NUTS ARE
UNSANITARY!" we finally stumbled upon linda's home fone #.

<cashier> Granite City Waffle House
<dhate> is linda working?
<cashier> No she isn't sir
<dhate> Damn!  Do you know when the next time she will be working?
<cashier> not for another two days
<dhate> oh great, i need to get ahold of her very badly and all i have is her
work number.
<cashier> would you like her home fone # sir?
<dhate> (FUCK WOULD I!)  If you could give it to me it would be appreciated
<cashier> no problem, just don't tell any one i gave it to you
<dhate> Don't worry i won't

        And that's how we got her home fone #.  Easy wasn't it.  So we called
her up at home and got this really cool guy.

<husband> Hello?
<dhate> is linda home?
<husband> yes just a second
<linda> hello
<dhate> Hi linda i was calling in regards to why YOU THINK MY NUTS ARE
UNSANITARY!
<linda> Fuck off asshole, you little cock sucker(linda went more berserk this
time then the first time)
<husband> I KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS, IF YOU DON'T LEAVE MY WIFE ALONE I'M GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS
<dhate> oh is that so pecan boy
<husband> yea you think you are so funny, why don't you come down here and see
how funny you really are
<dhate> was that a physical threat pecan boy?
<husband> GOD DAMN RIGHT IT WAS
<dhate> you're so sexy when you're mad cupcake
<husband> Oh you just laugh now funny boy, when i find you you're gonna wish
you never got a fone!
<dhate> oh is that so?
<husband> leave my wife alone!
<click>

        The next day they changed their number.  I think that's a record.
Even Glen Danzig let us call him twice.  Well after awhile they said that
linda didn't work there any more until one night i tricked them a good one!

<cashier> Granite City Waffle House
<dhate> can i speak to linda please
<cashier> She doesn't work here any more
<dhate> tell her this is her husband
<cashier> Oh!  hold on one moment(you can here linda yelling about why am i
calling so late in the background)
<cashier> she want's to know why you are calling so late
<dhate> it's an emergency
<cashier> OH!
<linda> hello?
<dhate> HEY PECAN BITCH, WHY ARE MY NUTS UNSANITARY?
<linda> fuck you little punk
<dhate> tricked you a good one didn't i?
<linda> (once again she went berserk and we hung up the fone to her yelling at
the top of her lungs)

        I'm gonna be moving up to Illinois soon and the first place i'm going
is the waffle house so i can harass linda in person.  So be expecting another
file on linda!

ansering the fone and then we finally broke her.

get angela all i have to do is say "say it" and she does.  One of the perks of
being a phone looser)

|        Awhile ago i stumbled upon DisneyLands vmb system.  It was fun for a
|few days but got old real quick since all they talk about is stuffed animals
|and felching.  So i scanned some boxes and found the number to Disneyland
|security.  Which was rather keen i thought.  So here is a log of me and Zak
|harassing the most wonderful place on earth. Oh if you want to harass
|them too then just dial 714-999-4330 and remember to say that you are Roy.
|______________________________________________________________________________


<officer> Disneyland security, may i help you
<Zak> Yea this is Roy at the tiltawhirl.  It seems we have a major problem.
<officer> And what is that sir?
<Zak> One of the tiltawhirl cups went haywire and flew off and landed on some
poor old lady.  I think she's dead.
<officer> Oh is that so?
<Zak> Yes it is
<officer> Sir we don't have a tiltawhirl inside the park.  Stop playing on the
fone.
<Zak> No!
<Click!>

<officer> Disneyland Security
<Zak> Hi, this is Roy the janitor.
<officer> What can i do for you Roy
<Zak> There's this guy that is making people watch him take a poo.
<officer> He's what?
<Zak> He's making people watch him take a poo.  He just grabs them and shoves
their head down there and he takes a poo!  Some poor old lady is tramautized.
<officer> What did this man look like?
<Zak> He was 5'7, black hair, black eyes, and he's wearing a trenchcoat.
<officer> Ok
<Zak> He's making people look at his poo for god's sake!
<officer> Were did you spot him at?
<Zak> By it's a small world
<officer> We'll send somebody out right now
<Zak> Thanks!
<Click!>


<officer> Disneyland Security
<dhate> Hi
<officer> uh hello
<dhate> we are inside the underground tunnels and you can't do anything about
it!
<officer> Just what are you doing down there?
<dhate> Urinating in the corner
<officer> that's all?
<dhate> Yup what are you gonna do about it mister!
<officer> You aren't terrorists or anything?
<dhate> Nope, i'm just a fone loozer!
<officer> Can you hold for a moment?
<dhate> Sure, i'll give you some time to pull my ani
...
<officer> Sir, you're not calling from inside the park
<dhate> It sure looks like i am
<officer> well you aren't
<dhate> and just how do you know that?
<officer> because it says so right here
<dhate> Well read off my ani then

<dhate> Yea this is Roy at the castle, some guy is sitting on top of the
castle and throwing spam at passerby's!  He almost got me that time!
<officer> Are you serious?
<dhate> Oh quite serious.
<Zak> OH SHIT HE JUST KNOCKED OUT A KID WITH SPAM!
<dhate> i think you better do something quick.
<officer> what do you suggest?
<Zak> Can you bring out the helicopters and scuba divers?
<dhate> don't forget the ninja's!
<officer> why would we need all that?
<Zak> Because the guy is dangerous!
<officer> Well just keep on talking to us guys
<dhate> why's that?
<officer> so we can get your fone number
<dhate> why would you want that?
