Welcome to my first TEk Zine! These are my first writtings.. I will start with
a bit about myself. I am ExiSt, Founder of The Elite Krue. Our "krue" is also
known as Three Elite Killaz.. The group was started, based on the fact that
there was a group of us here in our hometown, all very much into h/p, that
did shit together all the time, the creation of TEk was just a formality, to
give us a name. TEk is: ExiSt, Mind Flayer and Elektrik Tide. Although our
group tends to lean very heavily towards the Phreaking Scene, we still relate
as a H/P group. Our skillz combined have brought us close to ownership of our
local TelCo, and our city.


                _,.-ø'^'ø-.,_,.-øArtikleø-.,_,.-ø'^'ø-.,_


Hmm, it's hard for me to really choose a certain oNE thing to write about,
because our group is into so much. But, I decided to write about Social
Engeneering, because it is a quality of mine that I enjoy.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING:

What is it? Okay, lets say you need some info, ie: You just scanned a bunch
of 800 numbers, and, while listening to the scan, you heard a voice say
"Welcome to the AT&T Conferencing Service" blah blah blah..

Cool, you have the conf number... but, now what to do? Do you have to be an 
AT&T member? Do you need an AT&T Calling Card? Visa? Master Card? Do they 
need your name? How about your address? These are all possible questions that 
operators can and WiLL ask you.. so, you social engineer.. Call them up, ask 
them, "What kind of information will I need to setup a Business Conference, 
later this evening?" blah blah blah

Now, I must warn you, social engineering isn't for everybody. Think about
yourself. Are you a friendly person? Do you like to talk to people? or are you
shy? Do you have a clear, confident voice? Or haven't you hit puberty yet? It 
takes some courage at first.. You're not going to be talking to a Computer..
they won't give you a "NAME PLEASE" prompt.. you will be talking to a live
operater (or whoever you're calling), and they get suspicious, and they ask
questions.. So, now that you're ready, here's some pointers:

Obvious Pointers:

-Get a real sounding name.. Objew Jahosaphat just doesn't cut it, neither does
Jow Smith.. get real.

-Make sure your address sounds smooth.. none of this 1117 Milk Way or #2, 110
Main Street.. look it up in a fone book or something..

-REAL Phone Number.. make sure you give them a Real Pre-Fix for the Area Code
you give them.. don't say 815-290-4312, because 290 isn't an 815 Pre-Fix, and
they just might realize that..

-If you're giving a CC Number, and it's a Real Info card.. for heavens sakes
make sure it's someone of YOUR Sex.. nothing sux more than being ³->³ this
close to a conf, and then realizing your CC Card is for Jolene McBirstene..it
gets really annoying, trying to tell the operator she's your wife, G/F etc..

My Pointers:

-If you're setting up a conf, get a Real business, and make sure it's a GOOD
business.. would Fannies Flowers really be setting up a Conf? I didn't think
so.

-Try, if possible, to get a Real, Full Info CC Number.. generated are a hassle.

-Be friendly, talk to them about stuff, don't try to be all "eleet" infront of
friends.. If you sound like you have a bad attitude, then the operators will
have a bad attitude.

-Have all the info on you, on a piece of paper, or in your head.. don't be
last minute scrounging for an address or fone number..;)

					
                 _,.-ø'^'ø-.,_,.-øOutroø-.,_,.-ø'^'ø-.,_

Well, that was fun.. hope you learned some shit from there.. if not, then
you are as leet as me..;) 

Anyways, take a look at my next article, on how to Set Up a Conference.. I'll
include some numbers to call, names to use etc..

                           Secrets from a BCTel

Since Exist decided to write his first article on Social Engineering, i
thought it would be a good idea to follow up with a list of handy little
things i have recovered from a BCTel dumpster that might aid some of you in
your social engineering. The following is a list of Employees that work at
BCTel, along with their employee #'s, payroll #'s, etc.. they are good
if you need to impersonate a BCTel employee over the phone... here they are..
remember, each piece of paper that contained this info also contained in big
block letters "PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL"

Employee Name               Employee #                 Payroll #

There ya go, that should be a great help if you are an imaginative phreak
with good social engineering skills.. be creative people, social engineering
is another one of the greatest phreakers tools. Here is an example of a
good social engineering ploy(Over the phone of course).

PHREAK: Hello sir, is this Mr.Whatever?
VICTIM: Yes it is, may i ask who is speaking?
PHREAK: I am calling on behalf of BCTel security, and we have reason to
believe that your calling card is being used for fraudulent purposes.
VICTIM: Oh my! Really? It couldnt have been me, i would NEVER do that!
PHREAK: Well, we have reason to believe that your calling card is being used
by a gang of calling card thieves, we have had several reports of stolen cards.
and after a slight investigation, all stolen cards were being used to call the
same numbers overseas, over and over again. We have done a routine check on
all of our kamloops 374(Whatever prefix it is that you victim has) costomers
and we found that the same calls were being billed to your card.
VICTIM: My My, that is HORRIBLE! What happens now?
PHREAK: What i need to do now is deactivate your card, and issue you a temp
card, but before i do this, i need to verify that it is in fact YOU that i am
talking to, so i need you to read me the last 4 digits that appear on your
Calling card(As you already have the first 10 digits which are your victims
PHONE NUMBER digits)
VICTIM: Ok, hold on a sec....ummm.... here ya go, the last 4 digits are 1907.
PHREAK: Thank you Mr. Whatever, we will send you your temp card in the mail
and it should arrive within 3 weeks. We'll contact you if there are any more
problems. Bye.
VICTIM: Thank you. Bye.

There ya go, you just nabbed yourself a calling card that is usable for at
least 3 weeks.. and trust me, you can bill up a lot of LD charges in 3 weeks.

Thats my little tidbit on social engineering, hope you liked it and found it
informative.

Well kids, thats it for this issue, stay tuned for issue #3 which should
be out soon, we are still waiting for ELeKTRiK to get off his ass and write
and article, so hopefully there should be some info from him in issue #3.
Remember, dont feel bad about fucking with BCTel, they have been stealing
from you and your family for years, its payback time.
