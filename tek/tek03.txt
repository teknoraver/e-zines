Welcome to the third edition of TeK magazine. Alot has happend since the last
two issues were written, i will not get into all if it tho, but some
instersting things have occured that are worth mentioning. First of all,
info just seems to have a way of finding me, it seems that everytime i turn
around some cool # or code happens to magically appear before my eyes :)
I have found many dialups to certain systems that i thought i would never see,
i have gotten calling card #'s from places i never thought i would get them,
i have gotten credit card #'s from most unlikely of places (Right Exist? :)
It has been a crazy past few weeks for me and my phreaking career. There is
so much more i would like to say, but i cant, out of fear that i might
incriminate myself :) Anyways, enjoy this issue, as we have added a few new
features, such as TeK headline news! It is an article about local news
pertaining to H/P in loops. And it is also we have also added an update
article, that will keep you informed on all of TeK's updates. There ya
go, enjoy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                TeK UPDATES
                                -----------
Ok, TeK will now be accepting articles from other people that are not TeK
members. We want to see what other kinds of info there is out there that
other kamloops locals are getting. So if you would like to submit an
article, which can be about almost anything really, email it to MiND FLaYER
on H.W.N.R. BBS, and it might show up in the next issue. So, come on everyone
start sending in articles, from Credit Card fraud, to HAM radio, to WaReZ, we
want anything pertaining to the underground. Hope to hear from you soon.

                            GTD-5 EAX SWITCHING
                                 SYSTEM

First, i will give you a little background info on what a swithing system is.
A swithing system is (a switch) allows connect between two (or more) phone
lines, or two trunks. A basic T1 trunk is 24 lines on a 22 gauge, 4-wire
twisted pair. Not only does the switch allow connect, it controls connection,
where you call, and when someone calls you. In short it controls everything
about your phone, including special services such as call waiting, call
forwarding, etc.. The purpose of switches in phreaking, is to get access
to the switch, via modem, and fuck with it, if you had an account on the
switch, you could disconnect lines, add lines, add services, remove services,
increase phone bills, get CNA's, and lots of other shit, and you can see how
it would benifit a phreak, cause you could mainly fuck with your enemies if
you had access to the switch, and new all the commands.

Kamloops and Area GTD-5 Switch
System Discription
-----------------------------
The GTD-5 is a four-wire, electronic, stored program control(SPC) family of
digital switching systems that can serve a wide range of applications, from
a small community dial office (CDO) of a few hundred lines to a large class
5 Central Office with a capicity of over 100,000 lines.

System Overview
---------------
The GTD-5 family consists of host and remote units interfaced via 24-channel
DS-1 digital span lines called Host-Remote (H-R) links. The family members
include a base unit (BU) that functions as the basic switching system, a
remote periphreal switching system called a remote switching unit (RSU)
and two types of remote peripheral systems that are applied as pair
gain units, a Remote Line Unit (RLU) and a multiplexer unit (MXU).

The BU serves as the host office for the RLU's, RSU's and the MXU's. The RSU
may also serve as the host office for the RLU's and MXU's, but it must home
on a BU for access to the rest of the telephone network.

Base Unit (BU)
--------------
The Base Unit is located downtown kamloops on the 4th floor of the st. paul
st. central office, it is kamloops main switch, and it controls all RSU's
and RLU's.
The base unit is the basic SWITCH (The big daddy of the GTD-5 family).
The BU provides common control, administrative and maintenance funtions, and
the various swithing stages for the entire GTD-5 family, and it can preform
as any of the following:

a) A stand-alone Central Office (CO) in a small community of a few hundred
   lines.

b) An intermediate-size digital class 5 switching center that integrates
   several switching centers.

c) A metropolitan or suburban area application that consolodates many small
   wire centers into a single swithing center that can server well over
   100,000 lines.

The implementation of a BU provides the basic block of the GTD-5 digital
exchange, it can server as any of the following:

a) A replacement for an obsolete CO swithing system or one that has reached
   the end of its service life.

b) A new wire center within an existing wire center.

c) An addition to an existing wire center to facilitate growth and evolve
   to partially or fully replace the existing center.

d) A temporary replacemtent for an existing office during renovation of the
   building or during a disaster situation.

The BU is arranged for economical start-up to satisfy present needs, and can
easily grow in modular incrememts to adopt to future requirments without
signifigant changes to the existing network, facility interfaces, or processor

Remote Swithing Unit
--------------------
You can identify an RSU in the 604 area by the way the building looks, you
see them around town, they are small building, about the size of a car
garage, usually with a fence around them. They have some warnings about
electrical hazards on the doors, and the BCTel logo. If you could get into
one of these building you would have alot of elite access to phone lines
around the area of the RSU.
The RSU is a small to intermediate size remote digital switching system
designed for unattended operation (Once again it doesnt need some overpaid
Slob of a BCTel empoyee standing over it doing nothing but eating donuts)
The RSU can apply as any of the following:

a) A consolodating of small offices.

b) A switching system for a new wire center.

c) An addition to an existing wire center to provide for new growth.

d) A temporary replacement for an existing office during renovation or during
   a disaster dituation.

The RSU is linked to and controlled by the host BU (Which is usually located
at the central office) The distance from its controlling BU is limited only
by the onterconnecting H-R links (DS-1 digital span lines). The RSU provides
for local calls and has the capability for trunking(Under control of the BU)
between itself and other offices not not in the CO. When RSU trunking is not
employed, interoffice traffic is provided soley through the BU. The RSU can
server up to a maximum of 6,144 lines or up to 768 analog/digital trunks.
(Analog trunks are mostly obselete now) In the RSU, call proccessing
and maintenence instructions are normally recived from the BU via data links.
In the anticipated case where these links are lost however, the RSU can be
provided with an optional survivability feature. In this survival mode, the
RSU is arranged to complete line to line calls without any special features
such as call waiting, etc.

Remote Line Unit
----------------
The Remote Line Unit was FULLY explained in TeK issue #1 (Download that
file from Hackers With No REMORSE BBS at 604-828-7843.

Multiplexer Unit
----------------
The MXU is a small pair gain unit for use in sparsly populated areas(e.g.
apartment complexes, shopping centers, and temporary convention areas).
The MXU can home on either an RSU or a BU. The MXU is designed for pad
(platform) or rack mouting, and can server up to 96 lines via 1 to 4 H-R
links. The use of the MXU offers the following benefits:

a) A smooth transition from analog to digital facilities.

b) The flexibility to meet new growth requirments in concentrated areas such
   as shopping centers and subdivisions.

c) The economics of PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) carrier for feeder routes
   to make relocation of a wire center feasible.

GTD-5 System Attributes
-----------------------
The GTD-5 is a distributed switching system capable of serving in conjunction
with three smaller scale remote-type units. The design of the GTD-5 provides
a highly dependable system that is supposedly easily maintaned (If it was so
easy, why do switchmen make so much damn money??) State of the art, large
scale integration (LSI) technology is used, reducing the number of integrated
circuits to ensure overall system reliablility (Sounds like a pretty good add
eh? :) Structured software, multimicroprocessing techniques, and a Pulse Code
Modulation (PCM) digital network are incorporated in the system design.
The peripheral equipment converts analog signals to digital signals when
required, (And vice versa) and the network switches digital signals between
two-wire costomer lines(Your phone line) and DS-1 compatible facilities, and
other CO's.

The GTD-5 has the following major characteristics:

a) Network. A four-wire, Time Division Multiplexed (TDM), threestage
   Time-Space-Time (T-S-T) network is employed. The network for the BU and RSU
   are duplicated.

b) Costomer loop resistence. Maximum customer loop resistance, including the
   phone, is 1,900 ohms.

c) Host-Remote Links (H-R, these links connect the GTD-5 Base Unit (BU) to
   its three small scale remote units). These links can span distances of
   50 to 200 miles (With additions). This allows a maximum of 200 miles
   between the host office and the farthest remote circuit.

There, there is some knowledge of the GTD-5 switch, i could go on writting or
days about the switch, cause the info i have on it is quite extensive, but
that would take to much time. But now you know alot about the switch, and
how it works and its different components. From here you should be able to
figure out some way to fuck with the RLU's, RSU's and MXU's, and if you
found this info useless, then you are NOT A PHREAK, and should stop hanging
out on H/P boards. If any of you have any questions regarding the switch,
please feel free to contact MiND FLaYER on HWNR BBS, dont be affraid to ask
questions, thats whay i want.
