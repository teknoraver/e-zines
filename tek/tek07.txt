                A kick ass way to obtain calling cards and any
                        other info from a payphone
                        --------------------------
                               By MiND FLaYER

This is a method that takes alot of guts to complete, but believe it or not,
i have tried this, and it works. This method will allow you do obtain EASILY
calling cards, credit cards, and just about any info that you want.

Required Items of Equipment
---------------------------
1 cordless telephone (With Hangup/Recharge base)
1 payphone
1 Modified allan wrench
Wire strippers of you choice
alot of BALLS!!

Method
------

1. Modify an allan wrench so that it will fit all of those allan screws that'
   they use on payphones. The screws on payphones are a normal allan wrench
   shape with a little round metal prong sticking up in the middle, so that
   it will not allow a normal allan wrench to open it. What you have to do is
   modify an allan wrench so that the metal prong will fit into you allan
   wrench somehow. One way of doing this is to drill a small hole dont the
   middle of you allan wrench. The method of doing this that i recomend is to
   hacksaw a line straight down the middle of your allan wrench so that it
   looks like this:


                
    /------ \     <---- Allan wrench 
  /           \    
 |=============| <----- Hack sawed line (Supposed to be in middle)   
 |             |     
  \           /     
    \_______/      
                  
   So now when you use this, the little metal prong on the payphone screw will
   fit into this line.

2. Go to a payphone and take off the panel at the bottom were the phone line
   for the payphone runs threw.

3. Strip the phone line of the payphone an splice the phone line of your
   cordless phones recharge/hangup base to the payphones line.

4. Find the AC power recepticle on the payphone, most payphones have these
   hidden behind some panel, and it allows them to plug in the lights of the
   phones. Find this by removing different panels till you find it.

5. Plug your AC power adapter from your phones base into the AC power
   recepticle on the payphone. Pick up the handset of your phone, you should
   get a dial tone, if not, fuck with the splice job until you get it right.


If you get a dialtone and dial a number, it should as you for a quarter, as
this is a payphone line, and this is not beige boxing (Although it is the
same principle) Now that you have a dial tone, conceal your phones base
somewhere, in one of the panels on the payphone if they are big enoug, or
conceal it somewhere around the payphone, it differs on the location of the
phone. Put all panels back on and make the phone look 100% normal again.

Now take the handset and go hide somewhere close to the phone, so that you
have a good view of the phones keypad. Wait till someone goes and uses
the phone, if they make a normal call, where they instert a quarter, then
fuck it, wait for someone to come and make an operator assisted call
or a calling card call. If you see someone making a calling card call,
just before they enter the card digits, pick up your handset and say something
like "BCTel operator, how may i help you?" You are now connected to that
person, as if you were an operator talking to him. The person will say they
are trying to make a call with their calling card, and you say "Ok sir,
what is your calling card number?" The person will read it out to you, you
write it down, and hang up. The person will get confused and try to
make the call again, just let him, as you already have his calling card.
You can do this all day and get tonnes of info, the posiblilites are
endless, as you are basically impersonating an operator at a payphone
and people are so stupid, they will tell an operator anything, social
insurance #, Credit card #, you name it.

This method works really well for getting info, i tried it once and got
a calling card within 3 minutes, then i took off.

There is one other thing that i thought i could do with this. I thought
i could pick up my handset, dial a LD #, and it would ask me to deposit
$2.00 in quarters for the first 1 minute (Remember, this is a payphone line,
you cannot dial out without useing a quarter in the payphone) When it asked
for the money, i thought i could redbox from the handset, and i tried, but
i think that connection of the cordless phone was screwing it up, so it didn't
work, anyways, you can try it and it might work, if it does you are set,
you will never have to pay for a call again.

Free Three Way Calling

By: ExiSt

Okay.. recently, TelCo's have made 3-way calling a feature on your phone. It
is used by hitting the "Flash" button, or clicking on the button on the 
handset once really quick. The problem is, it costs money.. you can pay a 
monthly fee, usually somewhere around 5$/month, or a usage fee, often 50c
per usage..

Well, seeing as how I try to pay my TelCo as LITTLE money as possible, I 
found a way to get 3-way calling for free, more or less.. Here's what you are
going to need:

2- Phone Lines
2- Phone Jacks (female) found on the end of phone ext. cords etc..
1- Double Through, Single Pull Switch (DTSP)
1- Roll of black electricians tape
1- Soldering Iron (optional)

And thats all.. Now, make sure that the two phone lines you will be using
are in the same room, or, at least close to each other..this is kinda 
neccessary..

Okay, now, go get these materials, and now lets build this shit.. First, this
is what the bottom of your DTSP Switch should look like. If you don't have 
one of these, go to Radio Shack, and ask for one by name, they SHOULD know
what you are talking about.. if not, steal 10 switches, one of them should be 
the right one..

DTSP Switch: (Bottom)



                        ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
                        ≥ |   | ≥ 
                        ≥       ≥
                        ≥ |   | ≥
                        ≥       ≥
                        ≥ |   | ≥
                        ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ 
                          
DTSP Switch: (Top)

                        ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
                        ≥       ≥
                        ≥  €€€  ≥
                        ≥  €€€  ≥
                        ≥  › ﬁ  ≥
                        ≥  ﬂﬂﬂ  ≥
                        ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ


So, here's what you do.. Take the two female phone jacks. Make sure there is
about 1-2 feet of phone cord still on them. Splice the ends of both. First, 
remove the thick outter coating. Inside *SHoUlD* be 4 more wires.. some cords
will only have 2. If there are four, they should be BLACK, YELLOW, RED, and
GREEN. Cut the YELLOW and the BLACK wires off. Now, splice the RED and the 
GREEN Wires. Do this to both cords. You should have something that looks like
this:

                                                    (red)  /
                                                          /
        ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø                                        /
        ≥ jack  √ƒƒƒ-====================================
        ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ                                        \
                                                 (green)   \
                                                             \


Now, you should have two of these..  Number them 1, and 2 with a marker, to
make things less confusing. Now, attach them to the switch like this:


                        ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
g: green                ≥ |g  |r≥ (Line 2)
r: red                  ≥       ≥
                        ≥ |g  |r≥ (Line 1)
                        ≥       ≥
                        ≥ |   | ≥
                        ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ 

Now, decide which of your two phone lines you want to be the main line. For
instance, if you have your own line, use that one as Line 1. Use your parents
line for Line 2. Your switch should be like this for regular use:

                    ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
                    ≥ |g  |r≥ (2)
                    ≥       ≥
                    ≥ |g  |r≥ (1)       
                    ≥       ≥
                    ≥ |   | ≥
                    ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ 


                        ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
                        ≥       ≥ The white part is the switch. It is in the
                        ≥  €€€  ≥ "off" position here. When you use Line 1, 
                        ≥  €€€  ≥ have it in this position. Call a friend, 
                        ≥  › ﬁ  ≥ then, to activate 3-way calling, flip the
                        ≥  ﬂﬂﬂ  ≥ switch, you should here a second dial-tone.
                        ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ

I have made one of these, and if you make it properly, it should work.. 
Simply plug your two phone lines into the proper jacks, and everything is
okay.. The beauty of this device is that it is small, and portable.. you can
take it to your friends house etc.. If you have any problems with this device,
get ahold of ExiSt, of TEk.

Red Boxing 

By: ExiSt

Okay, I have had a few people now ask me about Red Boxes, so, I want clear
a few things up right now..

Red Boxing works on this principle:

When you deposit a coin into a payphone, a tone is produced. 5c, 1 tone/sec,
10c, 2 tones/sec, 25c, 5 tones/sec. The tones used are 1700hz and 2200hz.
So, in order
to take advantage of a Payphone, you must be able to reproduce these sounds.

Now, contrary to some believe, Red Boxes don't work locally. They will only
work for LD Calls from payphones.. 

Go to the net.. try www.l0pht.com, and get a Red Boxing program. I suggest
Cyber Phreak, or Blue Beep. Now, take a micro casset recorder, and record the
Red Box tone to tape. Don't be stingy, get about 10-20 $ worth of tones on 
the tape.. Now, rewind the tape, and listen to it.. make sure its clear.. now,
go to your nearest payphone, and call:

1-801-855-3326, the computer OP will come on, and ask for 2.95$ for the first
minute.. play 5$ worth of tones.. make her happy.. then talk.. when it asks
for more money, play more tones.. it's not that confusing.. I Red Box calls 
all the time.. it's pretty safe.. if the operator cuts in, then just play 
along.. play your tones, if she asks what that sound was, play dumb.."What 
sound? I didn't hear anything.. are you drunk? I didn't know TelCo Operators
were allowed to get DruNk!" something like that.. just play with them.. if
she catches on, then hang up the phone, and use another one.. No, using a 
walkman and headphones just won't work.. the tones need to be played loudly, 
right into the mouthpeice.. If people look at you, just tell them you're from
out of town, and your sending commands back to your computer at home.. they'll
think you're hard c0re 3l33t.. 

Anyways.. I hope I cleared up a few Red Boxing questions.. for a more detailed
file on Red Boxes, try the net, they're everywhere..
