Subject: Chaos5.Bjork

     When an artist from a popular group comes out with a solo album, it
always seem to fuel  rumors of the band's demise. Reports of the Sugarcube's
breaking up started spreading even before Bjork released her aptly (though
incorrectly) titled "Debut", but according to the singer, that's not the
case. Although they were the darlings of the music press, the Sugarcubes were
just a bunch of friends starting a "joke" band that got out of control. Now
the members are finally getting to do what they really want again, though
Bjork doesn't see anything preventing the group from working together again
sometime in the future.
     "Debut" is actually Bjork's third solo album (the first two being
Iceland only releases, one recorded as a child). The LP is filled with an
eclectic mixture of songs fusing together many styles, often sounding very
different from Bjork's work with the Sugarcubes. Most of the material on the
LP is stuff Bjork has been collecting for the past decade, waiting to record.
Some of the tracks were entirely written and arranged beforehand, while
others simply brought together musical ideas that had been floating around.
      "When I moved on and did my album, the biggest change for me was that
for the first time I was working only on my songs, in the past it's been
co-writing stuff," says Bjork. "So it was bascially a lot of fun."
      For the album, Bjork worked with Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul fame as
producer. Hooper did most of the beats, with Bjork playing about 90% of the
music herself on keyboard and using session players to round out the sound.
Bjork had not been a Soul II Soul fan and didn't even know of Nellee until
they met through friends in the London club scene. 
       The Sugarcubes had started in 1986 when Bjork and some friends had
formed a company called Bad Taste. Started up mainly to put out books, the
organization was a cooporateive effort where the members would work for free
to help each other get projects off the ground. Whether it be for a book or a
record, the members would do all the boring but essential day to day tasks.
     "These people formed together a joke band called the Sugarcubes, where I
was kind of the singer and we would throw out silly pop songs and get really
drunk," explains Bjork. "We just did this little record as a joke and a year
later we'd forgotten about it almost and some Enlgish journalist found it and
made it song of the week in Melody Maker and then everything went berserk in
England."
     That record was "Birthday," and the group tried to ignore what was going
on for a whole year before signing a record deal ("We had a good thing going
in Iceland and we weren't too excited about suffering as rock stars!"). The
Sugarcubes were immediate sensations, getting extensive airplay on
alternative stations and landing the opening slot on a tour with New Order
and Public Image Limited.
     After three albums, the band has taken a break to allow the members to
go back to what they had wanted to be doing all along. For Bjork, who comes
>from a background of doing all sorts of music for film, stage and other
projects, that meant getting back to her own songs. The singer recently went
out on her first solo tour, where she performed material from the album
re-arranged for the live setting as well as some new songs. Bjork says that
in the future there will probably be a remix album of material taken from
"Debut".
    "I'm a big fan of a lot of the remixers, not the boring commercial ones,
but a lot them are doing very creative, experimental things," says Bjork.
"Because a lot of people don't buy white labels, I might get all the songs on
the same record."

Subject: Chaos5.AphexTwin

Aphex Twin

     By incorporating the sounds of home made instruments into his 
electronic dance music, Richard James has become the rave generation's newest
hero. James puts out records under a variety of names, most notably The Aphex
Twin and Polygon Window, and late last year travelled around America as part
of the NASA "See The Light Tour." The music James creates ranges from
atmospheric ambient to intense hardcore techno, with the consistent thread
being the unique, often eerie sound created by his own musical gear. James
stresses that he "is not an equipment snob" but rather someone who can take
any piece of machinery and stretch it to its full noise making potential.
     James' first record, released as Aphex Twin, was 1990's "Sonic Bubble
Bath" ep. When asked about the various names he has used, James admits that
he is the worst person to ask that question. James is highly prolific and
uses those aliases just to get all the material out, but he says once a track
is completed it loses all importance to him as he moves on to the next thing.
He says that while Aphex Twin is commercially the biggest project, "they're
all the same to me."
     "Making records has just been a sort of by-product to allow me to make
money so I don't have to get a job and therefore have more time to make
music," he adds.
     James's fascination with creating his own sound making machines started
when he was a child. After "generally making noise" since he was very young,
James started experimenting with treated piano at age 10 before getting into
electronics at 11. James is completely self-taught and progressed from
messing around with tape machines to customizing existing gear and eventually
creating his own circuit boards from scratch.
     "I've only ever wanted to teach myself anything," says James. "I've
always detested learning things from other people."
      James says that he currently has more than a studio's worth of his own
equipment and in the past 14 months has used only this gear (with the
exception of his main computer and monitor, as James says he "not into
building TVs or anything"). Before, he had been using a combination of his
own machines, customized equipment and standard electronic instruments. James
builds a wide variety of equipment, some of which simply makes noise and some
of which is capable of being linked to other devices through triggers and
voltage control. When asked to describe what his gear is like, James is very
secretive and will not go into great detail about what it entails.
     "Some of them don't really look like anything else apart from boxes with
knobs on them," explains James. "Some maybe look like normal keyboards but
with all my things inside. I'm not into carpentry and stuff so I use existing
shells of other keyboards sometimes, and other times just build them from
scratch."
     James sees no limits in the potential of his home made equipment, and
says that the only thing holding him back is a lack of time to make all of
his ideas a reality.
     "I've sort of thought about talking with manufacturers to get things
made, but then other people get to use them as well, so it's a dead end
avenue, really," he says.  "I've got loads of offers to design other people's
stuff, but I've turned them all down"
       The home made equipment is too fragile to take on the road, so James
uses a more tradition set up for his live shows. But the performances
themselves are far from traditional, as James goes to the extreme when it
comes to not wanting the audience to just stand there and stare at him.
Sitting on the floor in the corner of the stage, James is hidden even more by
his computer monitor in front of him. A dancer provides the only visual angle
to the performance, which is about as far away from a traditional "concert"
environment as you can get.
      But the amount of material James has recorded means that he has more
than enough songs to avoid doing the same set over and over again. On the
NASA tour, James was able to make each of the shows different from one
another, mainly because he would personally find it too boring otherwise.
     "For each set, I usually have about 35 or 40 tracks," he says. "It could
be a minimum of about 25, or a maximum of about 45. It's just like having a
small box of records where you can structure every record and determine it
s speed in the mix."

Subject: Chaos5.HowardJones

Howard Jones

     When an artist who's been around awhile hits the road playing small
clubs without a new commercial project to promote, it usually has a negative
connotation. That's because it generally means the artist has been dropped
>from their label and is desperate for cash. But that's not the case with
Howard Jones, who recently toured America with a one man show comprised
mainly of his greatest hits. In Jone's case, it's just a case of taking a
break from the mainstream music industry.
      Jones has a new CD out, but it's only being sold at the live shows.
"Working In The Backroom" is a self-released collection of tracks recorded in
Jone's home studio that is probably more reminiscent of "Human's Lib" than
anything he has done since. While much of Jones' later work has had a more
polished, less synthetic sound, the music on "Working In The Backroom" once
again lets the technology maintain its electronic sound.
    While working on new songs and recording them directly to the hard drive
of his Macintosh computer, Jones noticed that he had been coming up with a
new song about every other week and the tracks were fitting together well to
enough become an album. Since his recording contract had expired and he had
not yet pursued a new deal, Jones decided to release the CD himself and go
out on tour with a one man show again.
    "I've been with a major record company right from the beginning, so
that's really all I've known," he says. "When that came to a natural
conclusion with a 'best of' album, rather that jumping into another big deal
I thought it might be good step back a bit and rediscover the joys of doing
things yourself."
     Before Jones hit the stage each night, the tour manager introduced his
mother, who came out and told the audience about the new CD. Howard's mom and
dad even staffed the merchandise table at the shows. According the Jones, the
biggest problem with staying on the same label for a decade is the high
turnover rate. New staff members come in all the time, and they never seem to
be as excited about those acts that have been around for a while. Starting
their own label allows artist to prevent this.
     The latest tour saw Jones going back to the format used on his first
visit to America; the one man show. As he got bigger and began playing bigger
venues, he succumbed to the belief that it meant there had to be more going
happening on-stage.
     "I sort of thought that was the way I should go, have more people on
stage," Jones explains. "I wonder whether it was right, really, because I
think actually I'm best doing things on my own."
     Back in the early days, doing a one man electronic show wasn't nearly as
easy as it is today, though Jones says that he has no complaints because he
didn't know any different. All the patches had to be changed between songs,
since sequencers didn't have large memories. The drums were supplyed by a
Roland 808, which was playing a constant pattern that was mixed differently
by the soundman to make it vary from song to song.
     Now, Jones beings a Macinstosh on tour with him to play the sequences.
Most everything is programmed, which allows Jones to just along with it on
his main keyboard and concentrate on the vocals.
     "I can play all that stuff, I put it in there," he says. "It's not like
I feel like I'm fooling anyone, they know how it all works, so I just jam
over the top and do specific solos."
     Occasionally, the equipment will just break down, so Jones is always
prepared to play on his material in the piano, as he was forced to do at one
of this tour's British dates. Jones, who did an acoustic tour this past
spring, is always looking for new and different situations to perform it,
which is the main reason he want back to the one man format after almost a
decade away from it. Sometime next year he hopes to do a few special shows
consisting of a massive installation, with speakers spread around the venue
floating sounds around three dimensional space with the help of computer
control. For these shows
, Jones is planning on working with Jed, the mime who appeared in the early
videos and live shows.

Subject: Chaos5.ITN

     Just because a band relies almost entirely on electronic instruments
doesn't necessarily mean they have to be synthetic sounding. A good example
of this is Sheffield's In The Nursery, who use samplers and computers to come
up with lush, classical sounds. Back in the early to mid 1980's, the duo
comprised of twin brothers Klive and Nigel Humberstone had a noisier sound
that relied on mostly traditional rock instrumentation, but they soon tired
of that format and moved on to samplers.
     "We found it very hard to express ourselves using traditional
instruments, like bass guitar and guitar and normal drum kits," explains
Nigel. "So they just [samplers] seemed more emotive as instruments to us, a
lot easier to put over what you're trying to say. They can be forceful and
they can be very atmospheric, which is what we like about them."
    The nature of ITN's music lends itself well to sound track work,
something the group has long desired to get involved with. Early in their
career, the group released "Stormhorse," which was the sound track to an
imaginary film that Nigel says was done "just to get it out of our system,
really." Now, the duo has done their first full blown film score, doing the
soundtrack to Everett Lewis's "An Ambush of Ghosts." The job came about after
the director had sent someone out scouting for talent, and ITN were one of
several bands whose music Roadrunner sent to them. Lewis did a rough cut of
the film using music from ITN's "Sense" and "Duality" albums, and then asked
the band to remix some of that material and compose some new songs.
     Perhaps the most surprising thing about ITN is that despite being able
to come up with powerful, intricate instrumental arrangements, they are
self-taught musicians. Klive says that everything is done by ear, adding that
"I tried to learn chords and things but it didn't get me very far."
     In The Nursery's music has changed quite a bit since they emerged in
1981. The early music tended to feature guitar and bass, always played
through heavy effects, on top of aggressive, very electronic sounding drum
machine beats. Strange, semi-industrial samples also played a predominant
role. ITN's boredom with traditional instrumentation was evident even back
then, as such classic tracks as "Twins" and "Workcorps (Fist Style)" had a
unique, eerie style despite making use of traditional rock instrumentation.
    Tracks on the "Twins" LP (1986) brought along the first hints of the
classical style ITN would use in the future, a sound that was expanded upon
with 1987's "Compulsion" and "Trinity" 12 inch singles before coming into
full swing on the 1988 "Koda" LP.
     In the early days, Klive and Nigel handled vocals themselves, but now
they have gotten away from that. Many of ITN's songs are now instrumentals,
or they use the voice of Dolores Marquerite C, who joined the band in 1987.
     "None of us are trained vocalists, so my brother and I always
concentrate on the music," says Nigel, "I suppose the vocal side falls short
and we used instruments to put over vocal ideas. But more recently, Dolores
has been contributing a lot more vocals and lyrics, so the new album should
have more vocals. We're also looking towards having some narrated voice from,
I won't mention the name yet, but it's  a well known author we've been fans
of for years, he's going to narrate some pieces for us."
    1987 also saw the addition of another member to the group, percussionist
Q. Klive and Nigel still remain the core of the band and are responsible for
all the composition. Dolores and Q come in during the studio sessions to add
their parts, and also perform live with ITN. In The Nursery usually do two
short European tours every year, though they have yet to perform in America.
     In the Nursery are currently working on their next album. Nigel says
that the LP will continue in the same vein as "Sense" and "Duality," though
the group will also incorporate elements of dance music into the sound.
    Despite being on Third Mind/Roadrunner, one of the largest and most well
respected independent labels, the members of In The Nursery still keep other
jobs to support themselves. Nigel is a journalist (his work has been
published in such magazines as Alternative Press), Klive is a graphic
designer, Q is an artist, and Dolores has worked in business and is currently
pursuing an additional degree in management.
     "It's nice to not be totally taken over by the group, but we would like
to do it full time if the money is good enough and allowed us to live off
it," says Nigel. "But unfortunately we have to provide an income by doing
other jobs."

Subject: Chaos5.Moby

     By using the highly identifiable "Twin Peaks" string line as the hook of
"Go," Moby had one of the first commercial techno hits and himself became the
music's first superstar. Despite the novelty feel of that record, Moby
(Richard M. Hall) proved that he was no one hit wonder and managed to follow
it up with an impressive body of work. It comes as no surprise then that Moby
has moved from indie label Instinct to Elektra and has put out his major
label debut, the "Move EP"
     "It's not all that different," explains Moby on the label move . "The
only difference there seems to be is that there  are more people to keep
track of. When I was at Instinct, there were all together three people at the
label, and now at Elektra they've got maybe 50 people, 60 people. It's just a
matter of having more people to meet, where as at Instinct it was sort of
like each person did a variety of tasks, at Elektra it's more specific."
    Musically, "Move" is very different than Moby's previous work, as the
sound is generally more intense and features more traditional vocals. But
Moby says that this has nothing to do with signing to a major, but rather is
the result of "year and a half of musical evolution that wasn't documented"
due to a lawsuit with his former label.
     "The biggest problem was I wanted to leave and they didn't want me to
leave," he explains. "And when they finally reconciled themselves to the fact
that I was leaving, they started asking for ridiculous amounts of money. I
think their first request was for like half a million dollars, and that's
crazy. Although I might have a relative degree of success, I don't have the
sort of success that warrants that type of money." 
      Moby also has some complaints on the way Instinct packaged and handled
his music. The "Instinct Dance," "Moby," and "Early Underground" albums all
shared tracks and were put together mostly from old demos. In addition, Moby
didn't really have any control over the decision to release the "Ambient"
album, despite it being promoted as his personal pick of his favorite songs.
Instinct had decided that they would put it out, and came to Moby asking him
to pick from his older tracks that they had.
     "It was like someone coming to you and saying 'well, I could either cut
off you toe or cut off your finger, which one will it be," says Moby. "It's
like the lesser of two evils."
      Moby chose to sign to Elektra because it is based in New York and is
one of the smaller major labels. He was originally going to go with Warner
Bros. but decided against it because it is too big and located on the West
Coast. Moby also feels that the label is more willing to try to understand
the scene that Moby comes out of, rather than try to plug him into an
existing category and framework. 
     According to Moby, Elektra hasn't tried to interfere at all with the
actual music, allowing him to keep full creative control. Although he doesn't
agree with everything Instinct did, he doesn't think he would be where his is
today if he hadn't started on an indie label well tailored to the dance scene
    "If I'd started on a major, I probably would have made one record and
been dropped," he says. "That happens so often. I think majors are really
good at coming in late in the game, but not very good at developing acts."
     Despite being on a major, Moby still  does everything in his home
studio. For the "Move" EP, Moby actually tried using an outside studio but
wasn't happy with the results, so he went back and re-did everything at home.
Moby says that he knows his equipment very well and can easily get what wants
out of it, but in another studio would have to rely on the engineer to
understand what sound he wants. 
     The title track of "Move" features a vocalist the Moby hired and sampled
for the song, and Moby himself makes an appearance as lead vocalist on "All
That I Need Is To Be Loved (MV)". In the past, Moby would occasionally pick
up the microphone at live shows and had sung a Recoil track, but this is the
first recorded Moby song to feature his vocals. 
     "Go" hit at the time the whole techno/rave scene was beginning to rise
up out of the underground and spread into the mainstream. New audiences were
exposed to the music through tours by such commercial artists as 808 State
and The Shamen (which featured Moby as opening act). Invariably, the media
soon caught on to the scene, but they seemed to be making it to be more than
it was, as rave culture has yet to achieve the wide spread popularity it  has
received in Europe.   
      "In terms of what it's done for the scene, the problem is that all the
media attention wasn't really warranted," says Moby. "I don't think there was
a strong enough rave scene in America to warrant the attention that it's
received. It was sort of built up to be this huge new youth movement, but the
truth is that it's just a few thousand kids getting together and dancing."
      One of this things the  media focused on was the drug aspect, as rave
culture emerged with its own drug - Ecstasy. Moby has always been very
outspoken about this side of the scene.
      "If you look at drugs in a very general, broad term, to include
cigarettes and alcohol, then I don't think there's any more drug use in the
rave scene than any other. There's probably a lot more drug use in rock and
roll because everybody's getting drunk all the time. But it's because alcohol
is a more socially acceptable drug. It doesn't stand out. But I do think that
drug use in the rave scene is a problem. Personally, I haven't done any drugs
probably in about 8 or 9 years, but a lot of these kids do it recreationally,
and they're doing really serious drugs. 
     "I know a lot of people who have had very positive experiences on
Ecstasy and have really found it to be a therapeutic thing, which is keeping
to the fact that before MDMA was illegal, it was used in therapy and
psychological and psychiatric applications. But now the drugs people are
doing are like Acid and Speed and all sorts of weird pills and synthetic
stuff. And they're doing it so regularly that I think there's going to be
some long lasting problems. I think it's also hurt the scene because now a
lot of kids go out and their idea of a good time is just sitting on the
floor, staring at their hands, as opposed to dancing or what ever."
      Moby has seen a big shift in the rave scene, as a new generation of
raves kids are coming along and those who have been with it since the
beginning are not going out as much. Moby says that when he goes to raves
now, he tends to not recognize anyone and doubts whether anyone there had
been to a rave before a year ago. In addition, Moby is not sure that the way
the music is heading is really for rave culture in general.
      "It seems like because the music was so exciting for a while and kept
getting faster and faster, really energetic, and now, at least at a lot of
the things I go to, the music is very calm and house oriented," says Moby.
"That's nice, but it's not very exciting. I like house music, and I like
disco, but in terms of going to a big rave, you want to hear things that are
going make you jump up and down, not just tap your feet. I don't know where
the future is. Either it's going to die off, no be anything, or it could end
up being what punk was. Like a flourishing of a scene that died off but then
was influential for a long time to come. If you look at punk, which happened
in 78 and then Nirvana, which happened 11 years later, or actually 12 or 13
years later, have a number one punk album. So who knows, in 10 years someone
might have a number one techno album."

One Dove

     It's been a long wait for "Morning Dove White," the debut album of One
Dove, but thankfully all the hype and high expectations are entirely
warranted. One Dove manage to fuse dance beats with guitars and ethereal
keyboards and vocals like no one else has done in the past. Their dreamy
sound manages to incorporate elements of the current dance and indie rock
scenes without ever coming close to falling into any preconceived category.
     One Dove is a trio comprised of Dot Allison (vocals), Ian Carmichael
(keyboards) and Jim McKinven (electronics). One Dove's first single,
"Fallen," was released on Soma Records and quickly attracted the interested
of Andy Weatherall, who put the bands next two singles out on his prestigious
Boy's Own Productions label. "Morning Dove White" was completed in October
1992, but contractual disagreements between Boy's Own and London prevented
the album from being released until a full year later. As a result, fans were
left waiting for the new material and in England the LP become one of the
most anticipated release of recent years.
   "It was a bit scary at the time, because we knew that it could only be
harmful," says McKinven. " The more people expect of something the more they
can be disappointed in it. It's like if all your friends are constantly
saying 'you've got see to this band' your imagination builds up to be this
great epic. Basically, all you can be is disappointed because nothing is as
good as your imagination."
     The group was totally satisfied with the album and chose not to take the
lag time to go back and make changes. Instead, One Dove took the year to
focus on becoming a strong live band. Despite using extensive keyboards and
electronics in the studio, the group was able to craft a live sound where
everything but the drum loops are played live. By placing more of an
importance on songwriting and vocals than many dance bands, One Dove are able
to comfortably take their studio created sound into the live setting.
   "Far, far too many people are taking the easy way out," says McKinven.
"Some dance tracks could actually just be running a random program, there's
not ingenuity in it."
    All of the members of One Dove have equal input in songwriting, though
individual songs are usually initiated by one member before being fleshed out
by the entire band. Normally, a song idea will start with a chord progression
as a base. Some songs begin at home with ideas being played out on a piano or
guitar, while others are created entirely in the studio. One Dove have
continued writing since the album was completed, though they won't be going
into the studio to record new material until early 1994.
     The three members of One Dove come from different kinds of musical
backgrounds. McKinven was a member of Altered Images back in the 80's.
Carmichael got involved with the music business by building his own studio
rather than learn an instrument. Allison had learned piano from her mother at
an early age but was pursuing a degree in applied biochemisty before deciding
to pursue One Dove full-time.
    Before they were ever actually a band, the members of One Dove had come
up with an idea of what their group should be like. At the time, it was all
talk, but it wasn't long before their vision turned into a reality.
     "When we finished talking about what we wanted to do, we actually went
into the studio and tried it," says McKinven. "We came up with 'Fallen' and
at that time we just thought, and right there and then we knew that we had
created something new and exciting, so that's when we decided to become One
Dove."
     One Dove believed in "Fallen" enough to raise the money so that they
could release it as a white label in 1991. They sent a copy to Weatherall,
who like it so much that he persuaded London Records to give them a six album
deal, just on the strength of that one song. Weatherall then remixed "Fallen"
and the track was released again in February 1992, exposing the masses to the
unique sound of One Dove."
    The group will soon be coming to play some shows in America, and is
excited because they are still considered a new band here. While British
audiences have been constantly exerting the pressure of high expectations, On
e Dove are excited to make a fresh start with listeners just now getting into
their music."

Vapour Space

     Mark Gage, also known as Vapour Space, is one of a growing number of
electronic musicians who is going back to using predominantly old analog
equipment. Vapour Space's ambient chill-out sound is created from the sounds
of classic Roland gear and other instruments that date back to the pre-MIDI
days. While digital equipment simply set up to run loops and sequencers makes
the performer slave to the machines, the older equipment allows for more
human interaction. Gage recently went out on NASA's "See The Light Tour" and
showed audiences how much more exciting electronic music can be without
backing tapes or heavy reliance on MIDI by doing a 2 hour ambient set. Seated
on the floor amidst his gear, Gage tweaked and twisted the controls of his
machines to create seamless electronic sound scape as interested onlookers
were able to see exactly how the music was being made.
    The first Vapour Space release, an EP entitled "Gravitational Arch of 10"
came out during the fall on +8 and is being followed by an LP, "Themes From
Vapour Space" in early 1994. In addition, Gage has put out releases for the
same label under the name Cusp. For Gage, signing to +8 meant that he could
finally stop waiting tables, something he had been doing for over a decade
while creating his music.
     Gage's musical experience began in high school, where he was taking
vocal training. It was at this time that he first got his hands on a
synthesizer. When he want to college, Gage was exposed to lots of new styles
of music and upon leaving after three semesters started getting involved in
local projects in the Rochester area (including one called Down With People).
In 1983, Gage began laying down tracks in his home studio. Back in the early
80's, he was mainly into dance music, but later got into "weirder
experimental stuff"
      But Gage was ahead of his time, as when he looked at what was going on
with the current state of dance music, he realized that the music he was
making all along fit right in.
      "I didn't pay attention to a lot of what was happening until about 1991
or so and that's when I started hearing things in clubs that I was like 'Wow
I was kind of doing this a couple of years ago'," explains Gage. "I could
hear things that I was doing technically that were now kind of fashionable."
      Four tracks recorded before 1988 are being included on the debut Vapour
Space album. Ambient seems to be the most appropriate label of the music, but
the use of samples is downplayed in favor of analog/acid sounds. But for
Gage, putting the music into a category is not a priority.
     "I have a real hard time differentiating, maybe because of my ignorance
about all the different styles of dance music there are," he says. "I know so
many people, you know who'll go 'this is progressive house,' 'this is
tribal'. For me, I've been at this for a while so to me it's one thing.
Granted there are styles within a style, but I don't know how to describe it.
The album is really varied from track to track, I mean there's even elements
of New Jack swing in one track. Obviously, it's electronic and that's the cop
out route to take. Beyond that, sure there's ambient elements, and sure there
are some house elements, I don't know."
    Out of the 8 demos Gage sent out of his current music, +8 was the only
label that responded. Ironically, Gage recently did a remix for one of those
labels that ignored him initially. When +8 responded, they said that Gage's
music didn't really fit on the label but that they liked his production
style. So they sent him a bunch of their releases and told him to get a
better feel of their label and keep in touch. Gage put together a new batch
of songs and got signed.
     Putting on an interesting live show is important to Gage, as his first
two gigs were done with tapes and proved to be unsatisfactory to the
performer. "From that point on I couldn't do it anymore," he says. "You're
slave to this other thing and if something's not stimulating the crowd
there's no way you can move on."
      Beyond the music itself, Gage's set up allows him to manipulate and
alter the actual sounds that are coming out. While the digital gear is pretty
limiting, the older equipment has lots of knobs and faders that will alter
the actual instrumental sounds. This is the back bone of acid house and rave
music, and it comes from gear such as the Roland SH101 and 303 Bass.
      "I think electronically synthesizers got to a point where they were
really stagnant," says Gage. "To me that's a technical thing. Granted,
Wavestations and things like that are really cool instruments but there's
nothing like having control at the end of you fingertips with older gear.
People are into the old gear because you can twist some knob and can make the
machine have feelings, it's not where you're just setting up a looped pattern
and letting it run."
    The human element that the old gear provides goes beyond just making the
live shows more interesting. Gage refuses to tell how long "Gravitational
Arch of 10" took to make, as it was a result of a happy mistake in the way he
had his equipment linked together. When working in his studio, Gage has the
DAT rolling all the time so that when something interesting happens he can
dump the recording to his computer's hard drive and edit it into a song.
    Gage admits that he did succumb to the temptation of high tech digital
gear, and actually sold some of his old stuff to pay for it. "I got into MIDI
really heavily in the mid 80's and at that point I was selling all my old CV
Gate stuff thinking that this stuff is crap and I'm going to buy this new
MIDI device that can do all this stuff" he says. "So I pur
ged my system of all this other stuff and have wound up since buying the
majority of it back."
