<Bluesman> Hey rayc
[PhoEniX] [*WallOp*] Anyone know this guy?
[-Bluesman-] [*WallOp*] rayc?
<rayc> hi bluesman
<rayc> what's up
[-Narcosis-] [*WallOp*] nope
<Bluesman> rayc: Hey. You on #delirium a lot or something?
[PhoEniX] [*WallOp*] I've got an idea. Let's talk like "hackers" ;>
<rayc> sometime, why?
[-Bluesman-] [*WallOp*] We are +nst
[-Narcosis-] [*WallOp*] heh
<Bluesman> That's cool.
[PhoEniX] [*WallOp*] Oh shit I forgot...
[PhoEniX] Finished WallOp on #delirium
<rayc> where you at?
<Narcosis> So where are we gunna set up the new site?
<Bluesman> acid: Heh.. Yeah. That NASA system was easy to get into. I found 3
           documents that were labeled code purple..
<acidflux> Narcosis - well I got a smooth cray account on a pentagon system...
<Narcosis> Blues: yeah, some good shit - how much money ya think we could
           bring in from that?
<Narcosis> acid: msg me the nfo please!  Sounds cool!
<Bluesman> rayc: We're at home and stuff. What's going on man?
<rayc> are you all on #deliruim?
<acidflux> rayc - yeah... hey do you read the la times?
<Bluesman> Narcosis: Well.. The Black Market guys are assholes these days..
           But they usually give out 4000 credits per document
<Narcosis> blues: not bad... was hopin for more like 8000 tho...
<Bluesman> Narcosis: I might just trade it in for the Bank of America password
<rayc> how come it didn't show any of your names?
<Narcosis> nieve human! :)
<Bluesman> Narcosis: Maybe once they read my summaries on the documents
<acidflux> rayc - so you did read the la times article?
<Bluesman> rayc: We hacked it
<rayc> i c
<acidflux> replaced mine with my nick though.
<rayc> any of you know delirium?
<Bluesman> The guy delirium? Oh sure!
<Narcosis> blues: did you get the funds transfered yet?
<Bluesman> He was here.. Said he'd come back
<rayc> when was it?
<Bluesman> Narcosis: I'm not sure if you really want a $10,000 transaction on
           a Saturday night do you?
<Bluesman> About 10 minutes ago?
<rayc> hmm.......
<Narcosis> blues: was hoping that you got to it yesterday...
<Bluesman> I forgot. I had to set up all those backdoors last night
<Bluesman> It's only $10,000
<Narcosis> blues: lets be more careful this time tho - we don't wanna make the
           LA times again, thats for sure!
<Bluesman> Hehehe..
<acidflux> Yeah Mr. Smut is still pretty pissed.
<Bluesman> Is he really?
<rayc> what are you all talking about?
<Bluesman> So he's a friend of yours?
<Bluesman> rayc: The Bank of America. We just got a transaction account on it
<rayc> damn.......
<rayc> what is the plan?
<acidflux> Yeah he gave me 8 visas and root on a cray...
<Bluesman> Ah well.. Just some boring transacting..
<Bluesman> We're waiting for acid to make a checking account
<Narcosis> blues: how much can we get before being detected do you think?
<acidflux> Access Granted!
<Bluesman> Narcosis: I checked my data sheets, and I believe their pen
           register flag is set at $100,000, so maybe $50,000?
<acidflux> Checking Account # 0207-034922
<Narcosis> blues: how long does it take for the pen register to reset, or does
           it with their system?
<Bluesman> acidflux: Ok.. Stand by to withdraw and deposit $5000 on my signal
<acidflux> Ready.
<Bluesman> Narcosis: It's instantaneous on this version.. Which is nice
<Bluesman> BRB. transacting..
<Bluesman> Ok.. Should take a few seconds..
<acidflux> rayc - nothing legal... heh heh heh
<Bluesman> Clear.. acid..
<rayc> damn.......
<acidflux> GOT IT!
<rayc> computer crime????
<Bluesman> acid: Ok! I got it here also.. I'm closing and getting the hell
           outta that..
<Narcosis> best kind - minimal risk of being traced...
<rayc> well, i've better get going..........good luck you all!!!

<acidflux> Hey bro!!
*** Mode change "+o gomez" on channel #DELiRiUM by acidflux
<acidflux> This is the mag's channel... lately it's just been a hangout spot.
<gomez> is it warez oriented?
<acidflux> More hacker-oriented.... the problem with writing about warez is
           it's so dated....
<gomez> that's cool.. hacking is becoming so accessable.
<acidflux> Wanna see one of the articles?
<gomez> sure
<acidflux> It's also sort of a humor mag.
<acidflux> Okay, found it!
*** DCC SEND connection to gomez[165.113.1.16,3316] established

<acidflux> Whaddya think?
<gomez> that look more like a log. sure you sent me the right file?
<acidflux> Yeah, it IS a log!
<gomez> hmm
<gomez> hmmm
<acidflux> ?
<gomez> whats the point?
<acidflux> Did you read the whole thing?
<gomez> well
<gomez> i scanned through it.
<acidflux> Um, nevermind =)
<gomez> let me try again.
<gomez> brb

<acidflux> Hey!
<gomez> hmm..
*** Mode change "+o gomez" on channel #DELiRiUM by acidflux
<gomez> this time i read it word for word. i can't make sense of it.
<gomez> are you sure you sent me the right log?
<acidflux> It's a log of some moron wandering in here so we convinced him we
           were computer criminals stealing money from Citibank.
<acidflux> Then at the very end he catches on and runs out of the channel.
<gomez> i conviced a moron by changing my name to <sysop> that i was sysop of
        Internet thereby getting his passworded.
<acidflux> Say what?
<gomez> i dont get it.
<acidflux> It's not a how-to, it's just an irclog of something interesting
           that happened in the channel.
<gomez> it has no entertaining aspects to it.
<gomez> nor is it educational.
<gomez> so that's what your magazine is? a compilation of #delirium log?
<acidflux> No, it's just something I had offhand.....
<gomez> im hungry.
