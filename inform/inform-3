/* Introduction */
   By the Informatik staff

       Welcome to Issue number 3 of Informatik Journal.  It's been a
whopping 3 months since we released our last issue, but at least our time
table matches that of 2600.  Sorry this took so long, but guess what. . .
we had a hell of a time getting submissions AGAIN.  How about putting your
creative talents to use and writing some articles so we can release
Informatik a bit more frequently.

       For our new readers, Informatik is an electronic journal containing
information that is for one reason or another usually withheld from the
public.  Sometimes it is for "security" reasons, and other times it is simply
because it is felt that the public does not need to know.  Hogwash we say!
Information is power!  Have they something to hide?  Are there things in this
world that we *gasp* just should not know about?  I do not think so.

       In other news, we have decided to reduce our news coverage to
strictly hack/phreak/fraud type events.  No more general computer industry,
telecommunications news.  Our friends at Phrack have that angle covered
admirably, and there's no reason to waste hard drive space with 60-70k per
issue of duplicate news items.

       This issue brings us information on public telephone abuse by Brian
Oblivion.  Could this be the end of red boxing?  For you radio phreaks we have
the tools needed to track down those airphone transmissions, and information
on how law enforcement monitors suspects and how you can get in on the action.
Black Manta provides us with schematics on how you can build a simple universal
garage door opener.  HiBias brings us a guide to TRW business reports that
explains just exactly what all those numbers mean, and another article
reveals the workings of those nifty credit card verification machines.
Tid-Bytes is back with some interesting blurbs, and the Hot Flashes of course
keeps you abreast on all sorts of goings on.

       We'd like to thank you for your continued readership of Informatik,
and we'd love it if you recommended it to your friends and upload it to
your favorite boards, ftp sites, etc.  Remember, subscriptions, submissions,
questions, or suggestions and comments can be sent to our Internet address:

                          inform@doc.cc.utexas.edu

       That's all for now, see you next issue. . .

Introduction
- ------------
 
Public Telephones: we all know them, and how vulnerable they are
to fraudulent abuse.  Well, so does Bellcore and NYNEX and they
have come up with a few methods on combatting fraudulent users.
 
Coin deposits by a typical patron of the public telephone are
communicated to the St Operator
Services System (OSS) by bursts of certain dual-tone signals.  These
signals consist of the two frequencies 1.7 KHz and 2.2 KHz simul-
taneously, which are detected in end-office and tandem-office environ-
ments to provide accurate coin deposit detection.
 
There are two types of interference that are encountered by outside
origin.  These are talkdown and talkoff.  Talkdown is the failure to
recognize a valid dual-tone signal because of interference from
superimposed speech or other noise that may be from either the
originating coin line or the terminating end.  Talkoff is the false
acceptance of speech, music, or background noises as valid coin
deposits.  This obviously includes redbox tones, whistles, tape
reproductions, etc.
 
In order to combat the erroneous acceptance of false credit the
following methods have been defined and are to be employed
eventually (if they haven't already), according to recent
information.
 
Frequency Limits
- --------- ------
 
The detector must accept dual-tone signals if the frequencies
of both tones are within +/- 5% of their respective nominal
values of 1.7 KHz and 2.2 KHz.  The detector must also reject
dual-tone signals if the frequency of either or both tones is
offset more than +/- 3.5% from its nominal value.
 
Frequency offsets of +/- 1.5 percent are the extremes expected from
properly designed and maintained coin telephones.  The +/- 3.5 percent
constraint is imposed to minimize the width of the stop-band notch
filters in anti-fraud notch filters.
 
 
Signal Power and Twist
- ------ ----- --- -----
 
The detector must accept dual-tone signals if the individual
power levels of both tones are within 0 to -25 dBm0 and within
5 dB of each other.  (Twist is the dB difference between
power levels of the two tones of a dual-tone signal)
 
The detector must reject dual-tone signals if the individual
poser level of either or both tones is below -30 dBm0.
 
The range 0 to -25 dBm0 is the maximum expected from properly designed
and maintained coin telephones and loops.  The -30 dBm0 limit is
imposed to minimize the depth of the stop-band needed in anti-fraud
notch filters.
 
 
Pulse Timing
- ----- ------
 
Nickels, dimes, and quarters are represented by one, two, and five
dual-tone TONE-ON pulses.  The dollar signal is represented by a
single long pulse.  Each pulse is followed by a TONE-OFF interval.
The following chart shows the timing specifics for all coin generated
tones.
 
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |                                   | Within-Coin | End-of-coin Tone OFF (ms)|
 |---------------------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 |                     | TONE-ON (ms)| TONE-OFF(ms)|  Must | Must |Allowed to |
 |                     | Must Accept | Must Accept | Accept|Reject|Acc. or Rej|
 |---------------------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Nickel  | 1 Pulse   |   35 - 160  |    ----     | >175  | <160 | 160 - 170 |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Dime    | 1st Pulse |   35 - 160  |   25 - 110  |       |      |           |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Dime    | 2nd Pulse |   35 - 160  |    ----     | > 75  | < 60 |  60 - 75  |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Quarter | 1st Pulse |   20 - 100  |   20 - 110  |       |      |           |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Quarter | 2nd Pulse |   20 - 60   |   20 - 60   |       |      |           |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Quarter | 3rd Pulse |   20 - 60   |   20 - 60   |       |      |           |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Quarter | 4th Pulse |   20 - 60   |   20 - 60   |       |      |           |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Quarter | 5th Pulse |   20 - 100  |    ----     | > 75  | < 60 |  60 - 75  |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Dollar  | 1 Pulse   |  600 - 700  |    ----     | > 75  | < 60 |  60 - 75  |
 |---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------+------+-----------|
 | Note:  The detector is allowed to accept or reject tone-on and within-coin |
 |        tone-off durations outside their respective must-accept ranges.     |
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 
Methods of controlling talkdown and talkoff
- ------- -- ----------- -------- --- -------
 
Talkdown, is more of a transmission error problem that is generated
by interference from superimposed speech or ambient noise.  This
noise comes from the originating coin line or from the terminating
end.  Talkdown results in the failure of the detector to recognize
a valid dual-tone signal.
 
One of the main sources of talkdown is the improper muting of the voice
path during tone generation.  This attenuated speech or ambient noise
power is superimposed on the coin signals which corrupts the signal.
 
Muting is accomplished by shorting out the speech path with a cap-
acitor.  Minimum muting attenuation is 15 dB at 300 Hz, 25 dB at
1000 Hz, and 35 dB at 3000 Hz.  The attenuated speech or ambient
noise power is superimposed on the coin signals which could cause
talkdown.
 
Some talkdown is also generated from the called party, operator
speech, or automated announcements.  These signals can only reach
the detector by reflection through the trans-hybrid path at a 3-to-4
wire junction, which is usually located in the originating end
office.
 
 
Talkoff
- -------
 
Talkoff is the false acceptance of speech, music or background
noises as valid coin deposit signals by a detector.  This is
what registers a valid deposit when no actual money is deposited.
 
In order to combat, a few countermeasures are expected to be employed.
 
      o The call must be terminated or routed to an operator if the
        total amount due for an initial deposit or a subsequent deposit
        has been received within an overall session timeout period.
 
      o The overall session timeout must be an adjustable parameter with
        a default value of 45 to 50 seconds.
 
      Intentional talkoff can be induced by playing loud music into the
      coin telephone by doing this one hopes to get the detectors to produce
      too many talkoff clusters.  A talkoff cluster is a group of talkoffs
      occurring within any 5-minute interval.  Single quarter or dollar
      talkoffs are also included in this definition of a cluster.  In order
      to combat this the following measures are being taken.
 
      o Total talkoffs must not exceed 12 dollars in 70 hours of continuous
        speech or music at a volume level of 0 vu referred to 0 TLP or,
        instead, at an active speech level of +1 dBm0.
 
      o The detector must not produce more than 12 talkoff clusters that
        exceed 20, or 40, or 95 cents in 70 hours of continuous speech or
        music at a volume level of 0vu referred to 0 TLP or, instead, at
        an active speech level of +1 dBm0.
 
      o Total talkoffs must not exceed 2 dollars in 200 hours of continuous
        speech or music at -17 vu referred to 0 TLP or, instead, at an active
        speech level of -16 dBm0.
 
 
Coin-Operated Telephone Fraud
- ------------- --------- -----
 
Fraud is possible by acoustically coupling accurate coin deposit
signals into the mouthpiece of the originating coin telephone, or
>from the called party end.  Fraudulent signals coming from the
coin telephone end can only be stopped within the coin telephone
with a notch filter to filter out any external fraudulent signals.
 
In order to combat Fraudulent usage the following will be enacted.
 
      o End- or tandem-office switching systems will be equipped with
        detectors that monitor signals from the originating coin line.
 
The following methods combat far-end fraud:
 
      o Sensing the direction of received coin signals and only
        registering those coming from the coin line.
 
      o Increasing the trans-hybrid path loss (using echo cancelers to
        knock down the fraudulent signal's signal strength to that under
        the detector's recognition threshold.)
 
      o Inserting a 2200-Hz notch filter in the voice transmission path
        from the far end only when the detector is expecting coin deposits.
        The filters 3 dB bandwidth must be less than 600 Hz centered on
        2200 Hz. and the out-of-band attenuation below 1500 Hz and above
        3000 Hz must be less than 1 dB.
 
 
Conclusion
- ----------
 
The BOCs are now taking action against 'Redboxing' as well as
against some of their own equipment defects.  It was only a matter
of time, of course.  I have no idea how long this conversion will
take or even if it has started.  There has been some indication
as some start of an anti-fraud campaign in my local area.  I have
gotten word from some people that coin operated telephones have
not been accepting tones.  I am unaware if these machines were
BOC operated or if they were COCOTS.  I believe them to be BOC
coin operated telephones.

     Now days it seems that Big Brother is always listening in.  Wherever you
are, whatever you do, there is a good chance that your private conversations
aren't so private.  The FBI, Secret Service, DEA, local police, and dozens of
other government agencies are definitely interested in what you have to say.
What can we do about this?  Well, unfortunately they have the badges and the
guns, so we may as well get used to it.  Since we can't beat'em, might as well
enjoy it, understand it, and learn something from it.


Mikes and Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Most FCC legal devices are found in the 150 to 174 MHz band, and other,
limited parts of the 40 to 952 MHz range.  Here is a list of FCC approved bands
for wireless mike, room bugs, and body mikes.  Also note that other bands MAY
be used with special FCC permission.  (An "*" indicates a band that may be used
by vehicle tracking transmitters.  More on that later)

 42.02  to  42.94  MHz
 44.62  to  46.58  MHz
 47.02  to  47.50  MHz
 72.00  to  76.00  MHz
150.995 to 151.49  MHz *
153.74  to 154.445 MHz *
154.635 to 156.25  MHz *
157.05  to 157.11  MHz
158.715 to 159.645 MHz
166.25  to ------  MHz
170.15  to 173.40  MHz
453.05  to 453.95  MHz
458.05  to 458.95  MHz
460.025 to 460.625 MHz
462.95  to 462.975 MHz
465.025 to 465.625 MHz
467.95  to 467.975 MHz
470.00  to 512.00  MHz
821.00  to 824.00  MHz
866.00  to 869.00  MHz


     If the purpose of the surveillance is not going to be used for criminal
prosecution,  agencies are reported to work outside of FCC restrictions to
avoid detection.  Though the FCC declares them illegal, devices have been
found that work in the government, TV broadcast, and even aero bands.  The
following areas of the spectrum are known to be used on occasion:

 73.00 to  74.6 MHz
137.00 to 138.00 MHz
216.00 to 222.00 MHz
400.00 to 406.10 MHz
608.00 to 614.00 MHz


Surveillance Repeaters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Law enforcement agencies use mobile repeaters and extenders to retransmit comms
of interest.  These low power (about 15 watts) repeaters are usually located in
patrol cars.  This allows the officer to monitor the surveillance device from
outside his car via portable handheld transceiver.  These are often simply
little used channels of their normal assigned bands.  Surveillance mobile
repeaters are still quite weak, so if you can hear it, it's probably close by!
(under your bed ?!)  Here is a list of mobile repeaters used by state
enforcement agencies:

Vehicle Tracking Transmitters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Enforcement agencies often need to track suspect vehicles, cargo
shipments, or packages.  Tiny transmitters are used that emit a quarter second
beep once each second.  Some contain motion detectors that beep once every ten
seconds when not in motion.  This saves battery life and of course provides
some information as to the status of the tagged object.  Vehicles used for
tracking these transmitters are easy to spot.  Look for four identical
antennas mounted in a square configuration.  (Hmm, that pizza-van has been
parked across the street for over four days!)


Remote Control Surveillance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Some transmitters can be set for remote control operation.  That way they
can be turned off during times of inactivity to conserver power.  They can also
be turned off to avoid detection during countersurveillance sweeps to avoid
detection.  Look for these types of systems in the 72.01 to 72.99 MHz and 75.99
MHz bands (20 kHz steps).  Some are thought to operate in the 300 to 350 MHz
band as well.

TRW keeps tabs on the financial standing of businesses, both big and small.
Just about everyone from AT&T to Billy-Bud's Bait Shop is referenced in their
files.  Just exactly what kind of information do they have?  What kind of data
do they give to creditors.  Exactly what kind of things could reflect
negatively on your credit standing?  Following is a sample of a typical TRW
business report and a sample small business advisory report.  These will show
the type of information that TRW hands out to creditors and how they interpret
said information.

 THE PERCENTAGE ABOVE IS CALCULATED BY THE NATIONAL RISK MODEL, WHICH USES A    
 POINT-SCORING SYSTEM THAT ADDS OR SUBTRACTS POINTS BASED ON A PROPRIETOR'S     
 CREDIT BEHAVIOR. THE MODEL ONLY EXAMINES INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON A         
 PROPRIETOR'S SBAR REPORT, AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OTHER DATA, SUCH AS   
 THE PROPRIETOR'S INCOME OR NET WORTH.                                          
                                                                                
 THE PERCENTAGE, REFERRED TO AS A PROBABILITY PERCENTAGE, INDICATES THE         
 LIKELIHOOD OF A PROPRIETOR BECOMING DEROGATORY IN HIS PAYMENT HABITS.          
 DEROGATORY CREDIT BEHAVIOR CAN BE DEFINED AS MAINTAINING ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE    
 DEVELOPED INTO COLLECTION ACCOUNTS, REPOSSESSIONS, CHARGE-OFFS OR BANKRUPTCIES.
                                                                                
 THE PERCENTAGES RANGE FROM 0% TO 100%. AS INDICATED ON THE SBAR, APPROXIMATELY 
 85% OF ALL PROPRIETORS HAVE A 0%-15% CHANCE OF BECOMING SERIOUSLY DEROGATORY

Garage door openers employ a DIP switch that the owner sets to his own
personal "code".  The code is actually just a binary number created by the
on/off positions of the switch.  The device discussed here will enable you to
open any automatic garage door (aside from some of the new dual switch models).

The opener employs a 555 timer as a pulse generator to transmit pulses to a
binary counter.  Each pulse will increment the binary counter by one.  You can
adjust the speed of the counting by turning R1.  You will have to experiment to
find the best speed.  If it is too fast, the signal will not be long enough to
open the door.  Normally, about 2.5 minutes to complete all 1024 combinations.

As you hit the switch, it will begin counting up, lighting the leds for the
corresponding switches as it turns each on. This will serve as a reference so
that you can set any opener to.

To connect to the garage door opener, first desolder the DIP switches from the
door opener and solder an IC socket into where the DIP switches were.  (This
will allow you to put the DIP switches back, when operating in normal mode.)
Second, you should connect the output to a wirewrap IC socket.  If you mount
the IC socket on your pc or perfboard you can use the socket to plug right into
the door opener.  When connecting the output, be sure that the connections on
the wirewrap socket correspond to the ON setting of the DIP switches.

Ever wonder just what those trendy jet-setters talk about on their in-flight
air to ground radiotelephones?  The FCC has issued rules on allocation of the
849-851/894-895 MHz bands for air-ground radiotelephone service.  Using this
information it is quite easy for ANYONE with a scanner to intercept these
calls.  Nothing that is said over the air should be considered secure.
Competiters, enemies, and the news media could be tuning in on "private" 
conversations at any time.  Here is the information on how it is all set up.
 
The new action (effective as of September 9, 1991)
 
     1) changes channel spacing from GTE Airfone Inc.'s de
          facto standards;
 
     2) orders GTE to make its service available to other
          air-ground licensees at non-discriminatory rates;
 
     3) divides each channel block into 6 control channels
          (P-1 through P-6) and 29 communications channels
          (C-1 through C-29);
 
     4) provides for a communications channel bandwidth of 6
          kHz;
 
     5) gives GTE 22 months to modify its current control
          channel scheme; during this period, GTE can use
          the lower 20 kHz of each channel block, which
          includes channels C-1, C-2, and C-3, for control.
          GTE then has another 38 months during which it can
          only use a 3.2 kHz control channel in channel C-2
          of each channel block. After these transition
          periods end (September of 1996), GTE must switch
          to control channels marked P-1 through P-6 in the
          tables below;
 
     6) empowers the FCC to assign exclusively one control
          channel to each air-ground licensee;
 
     7) limits the ERP of airborne stations to 30 watts;
          maximum, and that of ground stations to 100 watts
          maximum;
 
     8) limits the ERP of ground stations to 1 watt when
          communicating with aircraft on the ground.

This article contains information pertaining to VeriFone Credit Card
Authorization machines.  I have not run across any files containing information
on this subject, but if anyone knows where I can find more information about
these little grey boxes I would appreciate it.

The VeriFone comes under different names. This file is from hacking a ZON Jr XL,
but I have also seen ones that look much similar under the name TRANZ.  If 
anoyone has any information on the similarities/differences of these machines
I would appreciate the info....



               THIS FILE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
   THIS FILE IS INTENDED FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONS IN UNDERSTANDING/OPTIMIZING
                                   THIER MACHINE.
        THE AUTHOR TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTS OF OTHERS.

WARNING!  Please contact MichiganBankCard and all other applicible agencies
          before reading this file.



This is the basic layout the machine, and some information on how it works.

CLEAR:
Pressing CLEAR at any time brings the VeriFone back to the READY state.

BACKSPACE:
Used to erase previously enterd characters.

ALPHA:
Used to scroll through the letters on each key.  Pressing an 8 will display
8.  Pressing ALPHA will change this first to T, and successive presses will
change this to U, then V, then T again.

FUNC/ENTER:
Usually a blue key where all the other keys are grey.  Used to indicate
end of input when entering information, or to change the FUNCTIONS of
the keys to do alternate things.

(1)SALE:
Pressing 1(SALE) means you want to process a sale transaction.  The VeriFone
will ask for the credit card number.  The unit uses the CC number algorithm
to check this number and can display BAD CC NUMBER.  The expiration date
may be entered at this time at the end of the CC nunmber, or after pressing
ENTER it will ask for the expiration date which is of the form mmyy or myy.  
This information can be entered with the keypad or by sliding the credit card 
through the CC reader slot.
Then the amount of the transaction is entered (without a decimal point and
without rounding the cents) followed by ENTER.
The VeriFone calls in to get a 6-digit authorization number.  Usually this
is 6 numbers, but I have seen it composed of two letters followed by 4 digits
as well.  It usually begins with AP which indicates approval.
If the transaction in not approved it returns various messages depending on 
the reason.  This could be DECLINE, meaning there is not enough money left
in the account; CALL-HOLD meaning there is enough money but someone has
done an AUTHORIZATION (not a SALE) which reserves some of the accounts money
and will be released after 7-10 days if not DRAFT is recieved; or just
CALL, which usually means the card is stolen or cancelled.
This transaction is stored in the batch, if approved, and the approval number
is displayed.
Pressing CLEAR returns the unit to its READY state.

(2)CREDIT:
Pressing 2(CREDIT) is used for the processing of a CREDIT (as opposed to SALE)
draft.  Information same as above but the VeriFone does not call to get any
kind of authorization.  After all the information is enterd the unit
retunrs to the READY state.
This information is stored in the batch with CI in place of MC, VI, etc. to
indicate a credit.

(3)FORCE:
Similar to a SALE except that the unit does not call to get an approval
number.  Used when an transaction is DENIED, or erased.  The unit does not 
call to get an approval number.  The information is stored in the batch.

(4)UNDEFINED:
Could be used for special services, like AMEX transactions or Collection
Services.

(5)CHECK:
Something to do with authorization of checks and check cashing but I'm 
unclear about this one.

(6)AUTH:
Like SALE, returns approval or decline code but is not stored in batch.
Places a HOLD on the card for the entered amount for 7-10 days.  A sales
draft can be sent in based on this, otherwise the HOLD will be removed.
Used to reserve money on the account or to check to see if the card is good.

(7)UNDEFINED:
Can be used for more special services.

(8)CASH-MGMT:
I have no idea.

(9)BALANCE & SETTLE FUNCTIONS:
At the end of day or whenever the batch is filled (about 100 transactions)
a batch number is obtained.  This is a nine digit number that is used to
reference the batch of transactions when dealing with credit corporations.
First one must BALANCE the batch.  Pressing 9 (to BALANCE) will ask for a
password (stored in location 053).  Enter this number and press ENTER.
The VeriFone will ask for the number of transactions which is simply a count
of the number of transactions followed by ENTER.  If this is correct then
it will ask for total amount, which is the total amount of all the
transactions  (the decimal point is not entered but the cents must not
be rounded so that if the total was $174.30 it would be 17430) followed by
ENTER.  If either the # of transactions of total amount is incorrect  
then the VeriFone diaplays the first entry of the batch which is the
last 5 digits of the credit card number followed by credit card type (VI, MC,
etc.) followed by the 6 digit authorization number, followed by the
amount of the transaction.  By entering digits at this time, followed by 
ENTER,the amount of the transaction can be changed.  The batch is scrolled
forward by pressing ENTER.
When the information is correctly entered, The VeriFone displays READY (or
whatever is stored in location 030.)  When the 9 is pressed again (to SETTLE)
it calls to process the batch.  It transmits its information (if any of the 
information has been changed, it sends it twice) and recieves the 9 digit 
batch number, which it displays.

(0)AUTO:
An auto-dialer of some sort.  Phone numbers can be stored in memory, and
pressing AUTO will dial it for you and tell yo to pick up the handset when
it is finished.  I'm not sure how to use it.

MEMORY FUNCTIONS:
To review the VeriFone's memory, press:
        FUNC,7
The screen will display 
        =
and will wait for you to enter three numbers or press ENTER which will start
at 000.  Pressing ENTER will increment the location displayed, ALPHA will
decrement.
To change the Verifone's memory, press:
        FUNC,8
You are asked for a password, but this is not the password stored at location
053 (this password is used for functions like getting batch numbers, clearing
the batch, changing the information in the batch, etc.)  On the two machines
I have checked this password is 166831, which I obtained to when the local
authorization phone number was changed.  It would call this number twice 
getting a "The number you have called has been changed . . ." message,
then would call the 1-800 number.

Valid Memory Locations of form ### are:
000-399, 400-412, 500-512, 600-612, 700-712, 800-812, 900-912

                                be changed to whatever you want.
311-399 <EMPTY>

Many of the other locations contain long strings of characters that are some
sort of password/id/information (up to 40 characters I think) that the
VeriFone passes when it calls in, others are empty or used to store new
information.  Chnaging these can upset the functionality of the unit.
Local numbers are called first, and if no successful connection, then the
1-800 number is called.

CLEARING THE BATCH:
Pressing
        FUNC,6(?)
followed by the password (location 053) followed by ENTER.  The VeriFone asks
"CLEAR BATCH?".  Pressing ENTER clears the BATCH, CLEAR cancels this.  To
restore the BATCH, FORCE would be used to restore this information insted of 
SALE as SALE would obtain a second transaction and approval number.

UNIT SEND & UNIT RECIEVE:
Pressing 
        FUNC,* 
or 
        FUNC,#(?) 
does UNIT SEND or UNIT RECIEVE which does some sort of UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD 
functions.  I'm not sure how this one works.
Useful if important memory locations of the VeriFone are chnaged and
upset some of the functions, then the central company can replace the
information easily.

This issue we have an update on cordless phone frequencies, a complete CLASS
code list, a list of companies that can provide you with information and
material on bombs, survival, crime, and other fun stuff, and Holistic Hacker
gives us a peek into Bell.


Cordless Phone Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a little extra info on cordless phone frequencies from issue 01.  I
decided that there are times that the handset frequencies could also be handy
for when the base itself is out of range.  Note that a good many cordless
phones handsets are simplex, so the conversation will be one-sided.  Here is
the list again, with the updated handset frequencies.

channel          base            handset
1               46.610           49.670
2               46.630           49.845
3               46.670           49.860
4               46.710           49.770
5               46.730           49.875
6               46.770           49.830
7               46.830           49.890
8               46.870           49.930
9               46.930           49.990
10              46.970           46.970




CLASS and Custom Calling Feature Control Codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following list was compiled from comp.dcom.telecom postings and
the Bell Atlantic "IQ services" information line at (800) 365-5810.

(These appear to be standard, but may be changed locally)

*57  Customer Orignated Trace (COT) Activation "call trace"
        The number of the last call you received is logged at the CO.
        You get an acknowledging recording.  Then hang up.
        Write down the date and time.
        You don't get the number - you must contact the
        business office or police.
        Costs $1.50 - $3 depending on your area.

*60  Selective Call Rejection (SCR) Activation
        (start "call block" list management)

*61  Selective Distinctive Alerting (SDA) Activation
        (start "priority call" list management)

*62  Selective Call Acceptance (SCA) Activation

*63  Selective Call Forwarding (SCF) Activation
        (start "select forwarding list" management)

*65  ICLID Activation (caller ID)
        (turn on caller ID delivery to me, the subscriber)

*66  Automatic Recall (AR) Activation
        (activate "repeat call" - retry last number for 30 minutes)

*67  Call Privacy Toggle (block caller ID delivery for next call only)
*68  Computer Access Restriction Toggle
*69  AC Activation "return call" (call last person who called you)
*70  Call waiting disable
        "tone block" (prevent call waiting tone, useful for data calls)
        *70 // dial tone // the number you're dialing

*71  Ring, no-answer forward activation
*72  Call forwarding immediate Activation (72# on some systems)
*73  Call forwarding Deactivation (73# on some systems)
*74  Speed call 8 program (74# on some systems)
*80  SCR Deactivation "call block"
*81  SDA Deactivation "priority call"
*82  SCA Deactivation
*83  SCF Deactivation "select forwarding"
*85  ICLID Deactivation (turn off caller ID delivery to me, the subscriber)
*86  AR Deactivation "repeat call"
*89  AC Deactivation "return call"
n#   speed dial (n=2 to 9)
nn#  speed dial (nn=20-49)
72#  activate call forwarding
73#  deactivate call forwarding
74#  set speed dialing (8 numbers)
75#  set speed dialing (30 numbers)

Rotary/pulse phones: use 11 for the * (ex: *57 => 1157) (is there a
pulse code for #?  I doubt it becuase it's not a prefix)

You do not need to subscribe to call trace to use it.  Some areas
allow return call and repeat call on a per use basis.  The cost is
higher per use than with a subscription, but you pay nothing for
months where you don't use it.

*65 and *85 are used when you subscribe to Caller-ID if you want to
reduce the number of calls logged because there's a surcharge after
400 calls per month.

New York Telephone has a recorded message system describing their
services.  Here's what I gathered from (800) EASY-NYT (327-9698) (this
mostly jives with information from the Bell Atlantic IQ services
information line at (800) 365-5810)

Menu choice:

45 ->   A person relays voice/TDD at no additional charge.
        This is WITHIN New York State only.
        What about calls in/out of New York State?
        The operator said the originator should call information for
        the relay service.  This is a service of AT&T, and is currently
        not allowed to call across states.
        (800) 421-1220  voice
        (800) 662-1220  TDD

        The AT&T newsline (908) 221-6397  (221-NEWS)
        for Friday June 8, 1991 mentioned that the (Chicago) Illinois
        relay center opened June 10.
        It is the fourth, others being in New York, Alabama and California.
        [and Sprint's in Texas as mentioned in TELECOM Feb 1992]

46 ->   restrict outgoing calls to pay services
                exchanges 540, 550, 970, 970
                area codes 700, 900
        This service is free of charge.

14 ->   "Ring Mate" allows you to add one or two additional numbers, 
        each with a unique ring pattern (and call waiting beep).

AT&T has language translation centers.  I believe these are the numbers:

(408) 648-5871  AT&T Language Line (outside the USA)
(800) 628-8486  AT&T Language Line (USA only)
(800) 752-6096  AT&T Language Line information

You can get translators (English/Japanese, ...) as needed, but the
cost is rather high.  I'm not sure if reservations/appointments are
necessary.  It would be interesting to see the setup and costs for a
conference call from the US to Japan, using the translation center and
a TDD relay for the deaf (particularly if the deaf were non-english).
Or better yet -- a video conference from the US to Russia with
translators.

CCITT rules:

Politically Incorrect Publishers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a listing of mail-order publishers & distributors of books concerning
weapons, combat, explosives, etc.  A pound sign (#) indicates that the company
carries a line of books, but specializes in other items, such as gun leather,
yuppie survival goods, ID cards & certificates, medals & patches, outdoor
clothing, etc.  There are all sorts of nify goodies that you can order.

Southwestern Bell Visitor Passes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Holistic Hacker - H0D sends us this note:

   I acquired this goody on a visit of the SW Bell facilities in St. Louis
last year.  Here's a brief description of it.  The pass is on light blue
cardboard stock approximately 2.5" wide by 3.5" high.  The Bell logo is
in the top left corner and "Southwestern Bell Telephone" is typed along
the top.  Centered about 1.5" from the top is "Visitor Temporary Pass."
Below that is name, company, and admit to, all followed by some lines to
write the appropriate BS in.  "Void After" and "Issued By" are farther
down.  On my pass, "Admit To" = OBC (One Bell Center) and "Issued By" =
F.A.  Too bad I couldn't keep the visitor pass to their data center...

Wireless Cable Lottery Spurring Scams
=====================================

WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 APR 15 (NB) -- The Federal 
Communications Commission's lottery of rights to operate wireless 
cable systems is becoming a hotbed for con-men, according to 
federal and state officials. 

The Bush Administration has said it wants to end the lottery 
process and award new frequencies based on auctions, while 
Congress wants hearings and awards based on a "public interest" 
test. But until all that is sorted out, lotteries, in which people 
file applications and the agency chooses winners by lot, are the 
way the agency will allocate rights. 

The current controversy involves wireless cable television, a 
technology using microwave radio technology to transmit TV 
programs to viewers' homes, bypassing wired cable systems. The 
low capacity of such systems, compared with the high capacity of 
existing wired cable systems, makes them a risky business 
proposition in large cities wired for cable, but that has not 
stopped the con artists. 

So far, 18 state securities agencies have investigated or taken 
action against suspected scams in Georgia, with Illinois and Florida 
adding their voices in the form of press releases and warnings from 
state officials. The Federal Trade Commission has also been 
investigating lottery fraud, and has filed three lawsuits. 

Florida Comptroller, Gerald Lewis, who regulates the state's 
banks, claimed at a news conference that "boiler room" operations 
touting license lotteries have taken in $50 million nationwide. 
He said the con artists claim that for $5,000 they can virtually 
guarantee a successful application. The actual filing fee is 
$155, and over 36,000 applications have been received so far, 
according to the FCC. 

Illinois Secretary of State George Ryan estimated in a press 
statement that investors have risked $75 million on the schemes, 
and his office has taken action against two such companies in that 
state. The FCC has been granting wireless cable licenses for nine 
years, but fewer than 170 such systems are actually up and running, 
he added, indicating the business risk is considerable since 
wireless cable works only in a "line of sight" from a central antenna 
to a subscriber. 

Later this year, the FCC will launch a second and, perhaps, more 
lucrative lottery process. This will be for new frequencies to 
run communications adjuncts to interactive TV systems like that 
offered by TV Answer of Reston, Virginia. TV Answer has won 
agreement from Hewlett-Packard to make set-top converters for 
its system, which will offer banking, shopping, information, and 
games. In this lottery, however, winning bidders will be forced 
to build-out at least half their systems before selling their 
interests. Applications will cost about $5,000-$10,000, depending 
on the size of the market applied for, and total costs to winning 
bidders are estimated at $150,000-$250,000, again depending 
on the size of the market.

SPA Raids Grand Central Camera
==============================

WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1992 APR 8 (NB) -- On March 25, U.S.
Marshals and representatives of the Software Publishers
Association raided grand Central Cameras (AKA GCT Photo Dealers)
based on charges that the company had been making illegal copies
of software and selling computers preloaded with the programs in
violation of U.S. copyright laws. 

SPA member companies whose software has allegedly been copied
include Lotus, Microsoft, WordPerfect, Datastorm Technologies,
Fifth Generation Systems, Interplay Productions, and Sphere.

Copied software was found on 25 seized floppy diskettes which
allegedly served as duplication masters. In addition, sales
records with names of customers were also taken and will
reportedly be used to determine if those obtaining pirated
software will be named in the case against the store. 

Also seized in the raid, which was based on a federal court order
issued in the United States Court for the Southern District of
New York, were three desktop computers and two laptops which the
SPA says contained illegal or pirated copies of software.

Grand Central Cameras has agreed to submit to, and the court
subsequently entered, a preliminary injunction forbidding
unauthorized software copying by the reseller.

The SPA maintains an anti-piracy hotline, 800-388-7478, which
collects information from people wishing to report software
copyright violations.

To get a copy of the SPA Self-Audit Kit and SPAudit inventory
management program, companies should write to: SPAudit Software

MCI Nixes Billing For Problem Pay-Per-Call Services
===================================================

WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 APR 1 (NB) -- MCI 
Communications has announced it is no longer accepting 
applications for the more dubious firms offering financial 
services on its premium-rated "900" area code lines.

Specifically, MCI is prohibiting companies offering credit card
and loan advice services on the premium rate services. Newsbytes
notes that the majority of these companies are usually only
dispensing common-sense rules on building credit ratings up and
charging heavily for the privilege.

One "900" number that Newsbytes called in the US recently in
connection with a financial feature turned out to be a thinly-
disguised mail-order operation with a "Gold card" membership
costing $50 that allowed members to buy mail order goods at
normal prices. Considering that callers to the "900" number paid
$10 for the call itself, this was clearly a scam.

In addition to the financial services block on "900" lines, MCI
has also ceased handling billing for job agencies which offer
generic job descriptions and suggestions on how to get a job.

The changes, which take effect from April 1, are in addition to a
previously-announced block on adult services on "900" numbers.

"MCI has instituted these policies to further ensure that consumers 
are protected and are subjected to less confusion and fewer 
incidences of abusive sales tactics by some 900 information
providers," said Carol Herod, MCI senior vice president for
business marketing, announcing the block.

"While we have previously taken strong policy steps that are
consistent with FCC rules, these additional safeguards can help
to protect consumers during uncertain economic times. At the
same time, we want them to be able to take advantage of the
numerous consumer and business-oriented programs which 
offer legitimate and valuable services," she added.

The "900" area code service changes, which were notified to its
major subscribers in February of this year, are likely to cause a
major contraction in the number of companies offering premium
services, Newsbytes notes. MCI, ironically, was one of the first
telecommunications companies to offer "900" area code premium 
rate services at the beginning of last year.

Electronic Filing Breeds Tax Fraud Scams; Include Illegal Refunds
=================================================================
Los Angeles Times, Apr 14, 1992

    Los Angeles - Jerome Hearne used to rob people for a living, but sometime
 in the late 1980s or early 1990s he turned to a more lucrative livelihood:
 robbing the U.S. Treasury.
    Hearne's adopted brand of crime was electronic tax fraud.
    He and a band of Los Angeles cohorts joined a fast-growing group of crooks
 who are raiding millions of taxpayer dollars every year by filing false
 returns and getting quick, illegal refunds in the form of bank loans.
    The scams bring together clever ringleaders and large numbers of co-
 conspirators, often unemployed or homeless people who are willing to have
 their real names and Social Security numbers used on fake tax returns.
    In Georgia, such fraud is a growing problem, partly because electronic tax
 filing has been in place for only three years. "All of the kinks and bugs are
 going to have to be ironed out," said Loretta Bush, a spokeswoman for the
 Internal Revenue Service in Atlanta.
    However, she said, intensified efforts by the government to fight
 electronic filing fraud are working. Two Riverdale men recently pleaded guilty
 to filing false tax returns electronically. It was the first criminal
 prosecution of its kind in the Northern District of Georgia.
    The government charged that the men prepared tax returns for clients and,
 then without the clients' knowledge, altered the filings and claimed larger
 refunds than legally were due.
    The men arranged "refund anticipation loans" for their clients, using the
 returns with the inflated refunds.
    When a bank issued checks for the loans, the men endorsed the clients'
 names on the back of the checks, the government said. Then they deposited the
 money in their own accounts.
    The men then issued checks to their clients for the amount they were
 legally owed - and pocketed the difference.
    In Los Angeles, the fraud also involved bank loans.
    The crooks filed fraudulent returns electronically using the government's
 computerized tax-return system. Then they applied for bank loans based on the
 anticipated return. It takes only two to three days for the bank to approve
 such loans and for the scam artists to have checks in their hands.
    By the time IRS auditors discover what has happened, everyone involved
 usually has disappeared with the money - sometimes a great deal of it. Hearne
 and the government dispute the exact size of the take in his scam, but the
 total could top $1 million in false returns.
    Hearne, who denies he was the group's ringleader but has pleaded guilty to
 tax fraud and conspiracy charges, faces sentencing later this month.
    Hearne's case - which involved seven other defendants charged with similar
 crimes - is the nation's biggest so far. But Hearne has plenty of company in
 the electronic tax-scam business.
    "This is a major problem for us," said Dennis Crawford, chief of the
 criminal investigation division of the IRS's Los Angeles office. "It's what's
 hot right now. We've had to pull people off other areas to deal it."

Ads With '800' Numbers Don't Always Ring True
=============================================
Elliott Brack, The Atlanta Constitution, Apr 1, 1992

    Hey, no fooling. You may not believe this, but things aren't always what
 they seem. Really!
    Yet if anyone gave you a 1-800 telephone number, you would automatically
 think that it would be a toll-free call, right?
    Not always, we have learned. Though in most cases the 1-800 number is
 entirely free, the con artists have found another way to work a scam, aimed at
 getting into your pocketbook.
    You may remember that over the last few months we have reported a wave of
 mail to us and other people offering "free gifts," "free vacations" or
 "official notices" that you might have won something free. Actually, the
 way the message is composed, it appears that you are guaranteed of winning
 some major gift.
    In all instances, all you have to do is call the telephone number provided
 to learn what you have won. Up to now, it has been a 1-900 number for you to
 call, which should have told you it would cost you to dial that number. Yet
 the off-chance of winning something big has caused lots of people to pay those
 1-900 toll charges - only to find that the prize is either less than they
 anticipated or inconsequential.

                     CHARGES KICK IN IF YOU STAY ON THE LINE
    Now comes the new twist.
    Recently many people have received notifications, printed like a postcard,
 urging them to call a 1-800 number. It goes further than that. It says "call
 toll free 1-800 [number] for complete instructions." Now that would make
 anyone think there would be no charge for this call, right?
    Wrong. When they call the 1-800 number, they are connected to a
 computerized voice, which tells them to remain on the line and follow the
 instructions. It's here that the computer also warns that they will be billed
 for this service if they stay on the line.
    But since the postcard said "toll free," many people ignore this warning,
 only to find out later they have been billed for the call by their telephone
 company.

                        DON'T BE FOOLED, ESPECIALLY TODAY
    If you stay on the line, here's what happens next. The computer asks you to
 punch in the 12-digit ID number listed on the postcard, as well as your
 telephone number and ZIP code, before the prize will be revealed.
    In other words, if you stay on the line, the con artists get enough
 information to bill you for telling you what you might have won. The 1- 800
 number was used to lure callers, but what eventually happens is just like
 calling a 1-900 number.
    It all amounts to what appears to be one thing, but is distinctly another.
 This reminds me of what consumer advisers continually tell people: Don't give
 out your credit card numbers on the phone. Only this time, you also should not
 be giving out your telephone number, or else you'll get a bill from what
 appeared to be a 1-800 toll-free call.
    Today is April Fool's Day. Make a call to a 1-900 number, or even in some
 instances to a 1-800 number, and you could be fooled any day of the year.
 Things are not always what they seem.

Teen Accused of Avoiding Payment on $41,000 Worth of Phone-Sex Calls
====================================================================
Jeff Schultz, Atlanta Constitution, Apr 9, 1992

    The first bombshell - to outward appearances a normal, $25, no-calls- to-
 Uncle-Fred-in-Pago-Pago telephone bill - arrived in the mail in December.
 Dorothy Brown opened it, waded through the stack of computer printed pages,
 and . . . and . . .
    "I nearly had a heart attack," she said. "I mean, $13,000! I thought that
 was bad enough. Then I got the next one."
    Ms. Brown's next bill from United Telephone arrived at her Mountain City,
 Tenn., home in January - this one in excess of $27,000. She still hasn't
 gotten over the shock, but at least now there's some knowledge to go with the
 palpitations.
    Christoper Brown, her 19-year-old son, has been indicted by a grand jury on
 a charge of attempting to avoid payment for services valued at more than $500.
 The services were phone-sex numbers. The total was nearly $41,000.
    Mr. Brown, who is accused of making 746 calls in a two-month period, was
 arrested Tuesday and is being held in Johnson County Jail in lieu of $10,000
 bond. He will be arraigned May 1.
    This is the first time AT&T - the long-distance provider of the 900
 services - and United Telephone have indicted somebody for telephone fraud 
 related to such services. Tennessee is trying the case as a felony theft,
 punishable by a prison term, fines and restitution.
    Her son's future is only one of many concerns facing Ms. Brown, a machine
 operator at Levi Strauss and Co.
    During a 15-minute phone interview - she called collect - she asked a
 reporter numerous times, "This won't hurt my credit, will it?" and, "Am I
 going to have to pay for these calls?"
    She said she struggles to support herself and two sons in Mountain City
 (population 2,000) and added, "I'm having quite a bit of financial trouble
 as it is. I can't afford an attorney."
    Neither would she post bond for her son when he called her at work from
 jail at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. "He still didn't act like he was sorry when I
 talked to him," she said. "He was kind of giving smart answers. I told him I
 couldn't [post bond]. He said, 'Yes, you can. You get down here and sign it.'
 I told him, 'No, you should've known better.' "
    Ms. Brown said that when she received the first bill, her son denied
 placing the calls. She suspected that a prisoner in the state penitentiary, 15
 miles from her house, was billing calls to her number.
    "Then I started seeing tablets around the house with those numbers written
 on it. They're those romance numbers. I know he got them on TV. He don't have
 a job so he's home all day. I asked him about the numbers, but he said, 'Oh,
 it's nothing.' "
    She said that only after the second bill did Mr. Brown, , who last month
 was laid off from his job at a chair manufacturer, admit to the calls.
    Jim Cosgrove, a spokesman for United Telephone, said telephone fraud 
 affects the industry to the tune of $500 million annually, "but it's difficult
 to get enough evidence to press charges."

Privacy Is Hot-Selling Item At $2 A Minute
==========================================
Marilyn Kalfus, The Orange Country Regester, Apr 2, 1992

    Richard Koch says he has no clue who his customers are.
    That's the point.
    Mr. Koch sells privacy - at $2 a minute.
    His Untraceable Phone Calls, based outside Boston, is a nationwide service
 that prevents people's telephone numbers from being identified and keeps their
 calls from being traced.
    So, just who's using this service?
    "I'm completely in the dark," Mr. Koch said. "It's kind of a strange
 business."
    When callers dial Mr. Koch's 900 number, they reach a computer near Las
 Vegas. The computer, which connects them to a nationwide long- distance line
 Mr. Koch buys from AT&T, gives them a dial tone.
    The number? 1-900-Stopper.
    "This is not a sleazy 900 service," Mr. Koch said. "It's quite the
 opposite.
    "The people who call want to have privacy," he said. "The only call that
 shows up on their phone bill is the 1-900-Stopper call."
    The cost is $2 a minute for calls inside the United States, $5 a minute for
 international calls.
    The service can be used for local calls, long-distance calls and calls to
 800 lines, but not for calls to 900 lines. That way he avoids having to pay
 for 900-line calls that charge more than $2 a minute.
    Mr. Koch figures his service is especially popular in states that have
 approved Caller ID.
    "When any call you make or receive can end up in a marketing database, it's
 time for concern," he said.
    Mr. Koch also says his service is valuable for anyone who doesn't want his
 or her phone records showing up in court records.
    Daisy Ottmann, a spokeswoman for AT&T, confirmed that it works.
    Mr. Koch concedes that some people might use the service to hide criminal
 activity, calling it "a double-edged sword."
    But he said, "Criminals use the U.S. mail, and we don't keep track of
 everyone's mail. Criminals can go out and use a pay telephone and do the same
 thing."
    Indeed, anyone can conceal his calls by using a pay phone, Mr. Koch and Ms.
 Ottmann noted.
    "I just provide the convenience of using your home telephone," Mr. Koch
 said. "You don't have to stand in line at a pay phone and hope no one's
 looking over your shoulder."
    He estimates that more than 200,000 untraceable calls have been made on the
 system since it started two years ago.
    "They can't all be criminals," he said.

Italian Crooks Let Others Pay Phone Bill
========================================
Translated from "Tagespiegel" (The Berlin Daily Newspaper), Feb 22, 1992

Lui, Rome, 21. February 1992. [...] Half a million Italians are the proud
owners of portable telephones. The cordless appliance has become the favorite
toy of the Southerners, but the game may soon be over: the "telefonini" are not
protected.

Under the motto "Buy one, pay for two", crooks sell manipulated phones that are
used so that the buyer has to pay for the toll calls of the seller.  The trick
works like this: the crooks take a computer with a computing program [whatever
that may be--ed.] like the ones uses to crack automatic teller machines, and
fuss with it until they find the secret code for the telephone.  The code is a
combination of the telephone number and the serial number that is supposed to
only be available to the telephone company SIP.  When the code has been
cracked, it is no problem to transfer it to a second telephone, so that both
telephones have the same license number.  One phone is sold "under the hand" by
the crooks.  As an added deal, the buyer not only gets to pay his own phone
bill, but the fees run up on the second phone as well.  The Italian underworld
is especially keen on using this method.[...]  The mafia uses the "portabili"
for conducting their unclean business.

[... The police] have not been able to find the instigators, but they suspect
that employees of the telephone manufacturing company are involved, as they
have the knowledge of how the phones are constructed. [...]  The portable
telephone is well-known for the ease of tapping the telephone conversations
[which cannot, however, be traced to the place of origin. A book calle "Italy,
I hear you calling" with some of the more interesting tapped conversations has
just been published.]

Robber 'Foiled Bank System'
===========================
The Independent (Uk), Mar 13, 1992

An electronics expert stole more than (pounds) 17,000 in a high-tech
robbery spree, plundering dozens of accounts from automatic cash dispensers
at banks, Paisley [Scotland] Sheriff Court was told yesterday.

Clydesdale Bank chiefs claimed their dispensing system was foolproof and told
angry customers that members of their own households must have been responsible
for making withdrawals without their knowledge.

Anthony Pratt, 32, a bank engineer, used a hand-held computer inside bank
premises to record transactions being made by customers at "hole-in-the-wall"
machines outside.  He recorded the customer's secret number and later used it
on plastic cards he made with magnetic strips.  Pratt, of East Kilbride, was
finally arrested after he took cash from a machine in Glasgow.  He admitted
conspiracy to rob and robbery. Sentence was deferred for reports until 2 April.

FBI Fear Phone Advances Will Hamper Wiretapping
===============================================
LA Times, Mar 7, 1992

Washington- The FBI, contending that rapidly developing telecommunications
technology is hampering the vital tool of wiretapping, proposed legislation
Friday that would require the industry to ensure that improvements do not
interfere with the ability to secretly record conversations.

It also proposed that consumers pick up the cost of changing current
wiretapping equipment to keep pace with new technology.

If the problem is not solved, "terrorists, violent criminals, kidnapers, drug
cartels and other criminal organizations will be able to carry out their
illegal activities using the telecommunications system without detection." FBI
Director William S. Sessions said.   [...]

At issue is the rapid move toward digital telephone communications and
fiber-optic systems in which thousands of conversations can be carried by
filaments roughly the size of a strand of human hair.

William A. Bayse, assistant FBI director for technical services, and other FBI
officals contend that the transmission of hundreds and sometimes thousands of
digital conversations over a single link prevents current wiretapping
technology from isolating conversations for recording as required under the
1968 federal wiretap law.  [...]

Other FBI offical said the expense could be passed on to telephone users at a
cost of "probably less than 20 cents an average per month."   [...]

FBI officals maintained, however, that they already have encountered
difficulties in recording digitally transmitted conversations, now used by
about 10% of the nations phones.  They declined, however, to give any examples
of such difficulties.
