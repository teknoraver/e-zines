     Know thine enemy.

     Good advice for any battle.  For the hacker or phreaker, one's primary
opponents are computer security professionals.  Since the greatest feather
for any cyberpunk's cap is exploitation of a Telco, the behavior of Telco
employees is of particular importance.  Telco's spend a lot of time studying
what hackers do, what information they have, and then trying to apply this
information to thwarting the attempts of would be intruders in their
systems.

     Therefore, it seems like hackers and phreakers should be aware of what
the Telcos are doing to stop them.  Most hackers know about ANI Feature
Group D and the other electronic countermeasures used by the Telcos to track
down hackers, but how are Telco employees trained to detect and thwart
attempts at social engineering, and how do the Telcos respond to break-ins
that are detected?  This article will discuss basic electronic
countermeasures, the training and advice given to employees, and the
response of the Telcos to known threats to their systems.

/* Hardware */

     Before one commits toll fraud (discouraged by this publication), or
before they dial up a known carrier, questions race through their mind.  The
first and foremost is, "Are they tracing this call?"  It makes you wonder,
how many calls are actually traced?

     Unfortunately, which telcos trace and which don't varies from company to
company.  Needless to say, the Big Three long distance carriers (AT&T, U.S.
Sprint, and MCI) record both the originator and reciever of every long
distance phone call made on their system.  For verification of this, call
U.S. Sprint and ask for a billing report several months old.  Rather than
the spiffy little invoice you usually get, you'll recieve a crappy screen
dump from a computer with "best possible quality" or something similar
stamped on it.  It lists, among other things, each call, along with the
numbers of both parties.  As you can see, this renders toll fraud using any
of said systems practically impossible.

     Many local long distance systems, on the other hand, don't have the
facilities necessary for tracing telephone calls.  Use your own best
judgement.  As far as the regional telephone companies are concerned (Bell
South, Pacific Bell, etc.), I have heard that newer ESS systems record ALL
numbers dialed, including mistakes.  I find it hard to believe that this is
true, or if it is, that these records are easily retrieved and sifted
through.

     In any case, tracing is quite possible, and in some cases, is quite
probable.  Use your better judgement, and remember, the bigger the company,
the bigger the risk.

/* Prevention through employee awareness */

     Among telcos today, much attention is given to employee awareness.
Nearly all telco employees are trained to recognize and prevent social
engineering and hacking.  Unfortunately for the telcos employee laziness and
complacence often leads employees to replace caution with sloth.  For
example, much attention has been given to "trashing" or "dumpster diving,"
and employees are encouraged to shred sensitive documents.  In all my
trashing experience, however, I have NEVER found shredded paper.

     The same holds true for social engineering, explicit instructions are
given to telco employees to lessen the threat of information leaks through
clever social engineering.  Employees are encouraged to get the caller's
phone number and call them back, but this does not often occur.

     This advice for beefing up security was given in an article in
"Enterprise," a magazine printed by Southwestern Bell.

  *  Get rid of trivial passwords.
  *  Routinely change passwords.
  *  Review password files.
  *  Restrict access to "read only."
  *  Know to whom you're talking.
  *  Shred as many documents as possible.
  *  Post a warning which will be displayed whenever one logs into a
     computer.
  *  Lock up terminals, personal computers, and floppy disks when they are
     not in use.
  *  Eliminate unnecessary access lines.
  *  Disconnect modems when they are not in use.
  *  Avoid public domain software.
  *  Report suspicious activity.

     As you can see, computer security personnel have gotten smart.  They
are well aware of most hacker tricks, and are doing their best to explain
them to all of the other employees.  Hackers now rely on the forgetfulness
and laziness of normal employees for success, not the ignorance of system
managers.

     Telco security personnel are much more apt to check audit trails than
they once were.  Suspicious activities such as late-night logins, the use of
test and demo accounts, and the like are carefully monitored.  One should
use the telco computers during peak hours so that strange activity won't be
noticed by already busy system managers.

     Security professionals also carefully monitor activities in the hacker
world.  They keep a watchful eye on hacker BBSes and publications.  Each
finding, either a breach in security or increased knowledge amongst hackers
is recorded, prioritized and then published in various security documents.
One should be especially cautious of any "beginner" who asks a lot of strange
questions, because the telcos must have at least some people on the inside.

     One can also assume that if one telco or corporation has a particularly
effective strategy for stopping hackers, or a successful awareness campaign,
it will spread like wildfire to all telcos.  Despite the fact that telcos
are competitors, and are especially secretive since their business depends
on a technological edge, they are happy to share all security information,
since the ruination of the computer underground is one of their primary
goals.  This leads us to the final section of this article. . .

/* Responses to security breaches */

     What do the telcos do when they detect a security breach?  This may be
the most important question the hacker can ask.  Of course, one's goal is
to explore the system in question without being detected, but if the worst
happens and your intrusion is discovered, it's good to know what steps the
telco will take to prevent your future intrusion.

     The first thing to remember when hacking into a telco's computer is, if
you're caught, you will be prosecuted. . .  If there's any way they can get
you in court, you can bet your bottom dollar you'll be there.  Unlike other
businesses, which may ignore the occasional security breach because they
don't feel like it's a major problem, the telcos live in fear of hackers,
and do their utmost to prevent entry into their systems.

     Telcos make it a point to document every security risk, whether it's a
break-in on their system, a bug in an operating system, or some new
information found on a BBS.  These detections are often published in telco
literature in an attempt to educate all of the employees of the telephone
company.

/* Summing it up */

     Overall, the telcos finally seem to have gotten wise to most of the
scams run by today's hacker.  Despite the fact that telcos are often the
victims of hacking and phreaking (thank goodness), they are much less
susceptible to infiltration through hacking, trashing, and social engin-
eering than they once were.  The moral of the story is, today's security
measures are breeding a harder working hacker, one who must constantly
watch his back and look before he leaps.

                                [By *Sterling*]


     The purpose of this article is to explain how to use a scanner and radio
receiver to eavesdrop on private calls from homes, offices, cars, ships, 
aircraft, and trains.  I will discusses the best methods of monitoring, the
equipment needed, and list the necessary frequencies.
     
Why scan?
---------

     It is quite a simple, and in most cases LEGAL, to listen-in on cellular,
cordless, ship/shore, air/ground, pagers, etc.  The benefits of such
monitoring, aside from entertainment, can be quite high to the discerning
listener.  Callers quite often route to their favorite LD carrier to place long
distance calls.  They call their voice mail systems, private company
lines and diverters.  If you are have a specific interest in an individual or
company you may peek in on their "private" conversations, learn who they are
calling and what they are up to.  Apart from radio-telephone communication
scanner hobbyists are entertained by whatever they overhear on their radios.  
Police cars, fire engines, ambulances, armored cars, trains, taxis, airplanes,
and buses are all equipped with radios and you can listen in on them.  You can
monitor the local police and fire departments to hear about events before the
news reporters screw them up.  Hostage dramas, bank robberies, car crashes, 
chemical spills, tornado sightings are all there.You can hear a high speed
police chase, Secret Service agents on a sting operation, and undercover FBI
agents as they stake out a suspect.  How about listening to a presidential 
candidate discuss strategy with his adviser from a 415 MHz radiophone in Air
Force 1, or a team of G-men protect him while transmitting in the 167 MHz
range?  Listen to your neighbors deal drugs over their cordless telephone, or
as their conversations are picked up and transmitted over the airwaves by their
sensitive baby monitor intercom.  It's all there in the 46 and 49 MHz ranges.

What Equipment is needed?
-------------------------

     Scanners are available in two varieties: crystal controlled and
programmable.  The  crystal controlled models are cheaper, but require the user
purchase and install a $5 crystal for EACH frequency of interest.  Programmable
(synthesized) units don't require crystals and usually have a keypad that
permits you to store frequencies into channels.  Programmables are now so cheap
it doesn't make sense to buy a crystal unit as your main scanner unless you get
it for under $45 or so.  You can get a battery operated hand held scanner, a
bigger "base" scanner which is powered from an AC outlet, or a mobile scanner
which connects to your auto's electrical system.

Make sure your first scanner:

  1.  Has a "search" feature, which allows it to search  all the frequencies 
      between two frequency limits of your choosing.  The lowest cost
      programmables can't search.
  2.  covers the 800 MHz band, which is where cellular-telephone is broadcast.
  3.  Has an AC-adaptor available, as scanners eat batteries.
  4.  Has an earphone jack as you may want to record your findings.

     If you're not sure whether you'll like scanning, don't want to spend much
money, a 16 channel radio will do.  In general, the more channels and banks,
the better.  Deluxe scanners can be controlled by a personal computer, although
this feature isn't important to most scanner owners.

     Currently, the more popular scanners include the Uniden/Bearcat 760XLT
(a/k/a 950XLT) and Radio Shack PRO-2022 and PRO-2006 base/mobiles, and the
Uniden/Bearcat 200XLT (a/k/a 205XLT) and Radio Shack PRO-37 portables.

     All scanners come with a built in antenna, permitting reception up to
about 20 miles or so.  Outdoor antennas can extend reliable reception to 100
miles or more.

A breakdown of exactly what there is to listen to out there:



Cordless phones:
----------------
     It seems like everyone has a cordless phone now days.  Cordless phones are
quite easy to monitor.  Cordless phones are duplex, they transmit sound from
the handset to the base, and the base transmits both callers voices back to the
handset.  Obviously this is the frequency you want to listen in on.  Cordless
phones are broken into ten channels.  They are as follows:

Channel   Frequency (in MHz)
----------------------------
   1          46.610 
   2          46.630     
   3          46.670    
   4          46.710    
   5          46.730    
   6          46.770    
   7          46.830     
   8          46.870    
   9          46.930    
  10          46.970

Most cordless phones have the channel number stuck on the back of the handset,
and some have multiple channels.  The easiest thing to do is simply scan the
whole list of ten.  The main problem with cordless phones is the range.  They
are seldom able to broadcast further than a block or so away.  If you want to
monitor a users phone calls, the best method is to hook up a Voice-Actuated
Cassette recorder to a handheld scanner, wrap the whole combo in a ziplock bag
and lay it in their shrubs.  Come back the next day and you have a complete
record of all calls made and received on their cordless.  With the use of a
touch-tone decoder you can even determine who they have been calling!



Cellular Telephone:
-------------------
     Cellular telephones are quite useful sources of information.  Doctors,
lawyers, the phone company and business officials all regularly use celluar
phones.  LD cellular calls can be quite expensive to say the least, so most
users prefer to use Sprint, AT&T, etc. as their long distance carrier.  Thus
you can quite often hear them giving out their calling card number to the 
operator.
    Here is a method of determining which frequencies are used in a cellular
system, and which ones are in what cells.  If the system uses OMNICELLS, as
most do, you can readily find all the channels in a cell if you know just one
of them, using tables constructed with the instructions below.

    Cellular frequencies are assigned by channel number, and for all channel
numbers, in both wireline and non-wireline systems, the formula is:

   Transmit Frequency = (channel number x .030 MHz) + 870 MHz
    Receive Frequency = (channel number x .030 Mhz) + 825 Mhz
 
    "Band A" (one of the two blocks) uses channels 1 - 333.  To construct a
table showing frequency by cells, use channel 333 as the top left corner of a
table.  The next entry to the right of channel 333 is 332, the next is 331,
etc., down to channel 313.  Enter channel 312 underneath 333, 311 under 332,
etc.  Each channel across the top row is the first channel in each CELL of the
system; each channel DOWN from the column from the the first channel is the
next frequency assigned to that cell.  You may have noted that each channel
down is 21 channels lower in number.  Usually the data channel used is the
highest numbered channel in a cell.

    "Band B" uses channels from 334 to 666.  Construct your table in a similar
way, with channel 334 in the upper left corner, 335 the next entry to the
right.  The data channel should be the lowest numbered channel in each cell
this time.

     You want to tune-in on the non-data, RECEIVE channels.  The transmit
channel is a low power signal from the mobile source to the microwave tower,
which rebroadcasts both caller's voices.  The Data channel is used to send such
things as the callers serial number, and connecting cell information, this
information is not audible, though I hope to discuss this in depth with a later
article.

     Scan from around 870 MHz to 894 MHz and note any signals you receive.  
Once you find a frequency listed in the following chart, you know that your
area also uses all other channels in that cell for that particular band.

Restoring cellular reception.
     Some scanners have been blocked from receiving the cellular band.  This
can be corrected.  It started out with the Realistic PRO-2004 and the PRO-34,
and went to the PRO-2005.  To restore cellular for the 2004, open the radio 
and turn it upside down.  Carefully remove the cover.  Clip one leg of D-513 to
restore cellular frequencies.  For the PRO-2005, the procedure is the same, 
except you clip one leg of D-502 to restore cellular reception.  On the PRO-34
and PRO-37, Cut D11 to add 824-851 and 869-896 MHz bands with 30 kHz spacing

     All these are described in great detail in the "Scanner Modification
Handbook" volumes I. and II. by Bill Cheek, both available from Communications
Electronics Inc. (313) 996-8888. They run about $18 apiece.


Pagers:
-------
     Pocket pagers and the like operate in the area of 150-160 MHz.


Phone-Patches:
--------------
     A phone patch is a way to use a telephone via two-way radio. Basically how
it works is the patch is connected to a repeater and a phone.  The patch will
interpret signals from a transceiver to activate itself and call out to the 
desired party.  This then allows the person with the transceiver to call anyone
from his handheld radio unit.  Phone-Patches are usually located on most bands,
as they are simply an attachment to the repeater.


Police, Fire, Ambulance and the like:
-------------------------------------
     The easiest way to find these frequencies is to go to Radio Shack and buy
their listing, it runs around $8, and is set up for groups of neighboring
states.  Hell, photocopy the pages you want and then return it!  But generally
these are located in 450-460 MHz.

      Loops occur in all area codes and consist of two phone numbers.  These
numbers are in the same exchange and the last four digits are usually similar.
a typical loop pair might look like 212-555-9990 and 555-9993.  There are
usually at least twenty loops in an area code and often all of the loops in an
area code will have identical suffix pairs.

      The basic thing about any loop is that the two numbers are connected
together.  If I were to call one number and you were to call the other we'd be
connected.  It's all a bit eerie at first because most loops do not ring; if 
you dial a loop and there is someone on the other end you will be instantly
connected.  What will you hear if you dial a loop number and there's no one on
the other end?  That depends upon which of the numbers you dial.  If you dial
the higher number of the pair you will hear only silence; if you dial the
lower you will hear a 1000 Hz tone.  On most loops you can talk to one caller
after another on the other end, very much like any other phone connection.  You
may be asking so what?  The answer to your question is that loops offer 
anonymity.  People use this anonymity for many reasons.

      We are now to the point of wondering what telco uses loops for.  There
have been a number of theories advanced on this topic over the years but few 
people have bothered to ask telco.  One common theory has been akin to the idea
that the loops are somehow used to "tie up" unused phone lines at the central
office to "keep them out of trouble." (I have always enjoyed the image  of two
lonely phone lines tied together to keep them company.)

      Loops are used to save time and manpower in testing long distance trunks;
we're not talking about the phone line that connects your phone to the 
central office but the trunks that connect central offices and run in length
from a few thousand feet to many miles.  When you talk on the phone, your voice
and the caller's voice go in different directions.  Once the line gets to
telco premises the signal is divided up into two circuits.  One circuit
carries your voice and the other carries your caller's voice. If the signals
were kept on one circuit there would be problems with feedback and echoes. 
Trunks may consist of two pairs of two wire circuits or may be radio 
frequency carriers on a cable.  Trunks have repeaters along the way which 
amplify the signal remove echoes and equalize frequencies. Repeaters occur 
about every two miles on an "old style" wire trunk line and about every 2000 
feet on carrier trunks. Very short trunks may not have a repeater. Repeaters
need to be tested and adjusted occasionally. In the old days a tech would
test a trunk by arranging for someone to be at The other end.  He would then
send a 1000 Hz test tone to the other person who would read the volume on a
meter.  To complete the test the other tech sends a signal back on the other
leg to the first tech as the phone system grew telco decided to cut down on
manpower by tying two lines together.  Thus the loop was born.  Trunks are
tied together via a thing called a "zero loss terminator" which connects lines
so there is no change in volume.  By the mid fifties, the entire phone system
had been equipped with loops, so a tech at one end could test a trunk alone
by dialing a loop. he dials the other half of the loop with a known good
trunk. Then he reverses the signal path to complete the test.

      It wasn't long before some ordinary citizens discovered that loops could
also pass voices, not just tones.  Since the lines be longed to telco they 
weren't billed for the call.  So a few people made free calls to friends but
there was so little of this that its effect on the phone company's income was
negligible.  It wasn't until years later in the early seventies that bell was 
to put billing circuitry on loop numbers.  To avoid giving away their location
most bookies used a cheesebox a device that connects two phone lines together. 
Cheeseboxes were installed in a small business, often a small butcher shop or a
grocery.  The bookie arranged with the proprietor to have two phones installed
in the shop and would pay a small monthly fee.  He then tied the lines together
with his cheesebox and gave one of the numbers to his clientel.  Some bookies
Either couldn't afford a cheesebox or couldn't locate one at any price, so they
hit upon using loops.
 
      It was good while it lasted.  Gradually however, more and more shady
characters started using loops.  The authorities weren't blind to this and 
started approaching the telco to do traces on these loops.  Eventually the
phone company was spending a lot of time and money on criminal traces and 
decided to do something about these loops.

      In the late 50's, the phone company started inserting a bandpass filter
that passed only 1000 Hz in the terminator end of its' loops.  With this change
it successfully blocked voices.

      We're going to see that the solution was only temporary though.  The old
style four wire trunks could only handle one call at a time taking up a lot
of wire and space.  There had to be a way to cram calls into a smaller space.
By the early 1960's bell had started switching to carrier trunks which put
many calls on a cable.  Each signal modulated an AM carrier on a different 
frequency.  Because AM carriers use radio frequency transmitters and recievers,
they could no longer pass a 1000 Hz tone through the bandpass filter.  So a 
switch was added to switch it on and off. Normally the filter would be left on.
When a tech wished to test a trunk he would turn the switch on, bypassing the 
filter.  When he was done he was expected to turn off the switch.  If he 
forgets a loop will continue to pass voice frequencies until it is switched
off.

      Let's look at how loops are used nowadays.  If a tech dials up the lower
number he will immediately ge a 1000 Hz tone coming back to him which is
injected at a specific volume known as "Zero db" level.  Using his meter he
can gauge if there are any problems on the line.  If he needs to do a
complete test at various frequencies he then turns the filter bypass switch
on.  Most of this work is done at night when repair people are free from
normal chores.

      It turns out there are people using loops for more things than I had
imagined.  I have always wondered if spies use loops but i haven't encountered
any yet.  When i started looking into loops I was aware that some radio 
pirates use loops.  Especially in the New York City area you'll often run
into AM and FM pirates on loops late at night.

      Some local loop numbers are pretty well known and are passed around high
schools and colleges.  When students get bored at night or want to find a
party they call a loop and wait there till someone else calls.  It may be
someone they know or a complete stranger, but it's someone to talk to.  Then
there are the loop habituates.  They regulary meet with their circle of friends
and aquaintances on loops and tend to resent strangers on THEIR loops.  

      Representatives are quick to point out that loops belong to the phone
company.  Anyone else using them is a transgressor.  Since Bell is the 
aggrieved party it needn't have any qualms about listening to loops nor about
tracing callers.  Bell wishes to discourage people from using them and 
periodically programs its billing computer to look for loop numbers.  Any 
customer thus found is sent a card pointing out that these numbers belong to
the telco.  With the exception of those stealing services, Bell becomes aware 
that some one is calling a loop using a faked credit card number; or Sprint or
MCI will ask for help tracing someone illegally stealing their services to 
call a loop.  Then it's a matter of waiting for the person to try again and
tracing the call.  In these affairs the phone company is very aggressive and
effective in tracking down offenders.  Bell has some very well trained people
who are most adept at keeping the offender on the line until a trace is
complete.

Introduction: The State of the Hack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   After surveying a rather large g-file collection, my attention was drawn to
the fact that there hasn't been a good introductory file written for absolute
beginners since back when Mark Tabas was cranking them out (and almost
*everyone* was a beginner!)  The Arts of Hacking and Phreaking have changed
radically since that time, and as the 90's approach, the hack/phreak community
has recovered from the Summer '87 busts (just like it recovered from the Fall
'85 busts, and like it will always recover from attempts to shut it down), and
the progressive media (from Reality Hackers magazine to William Gibson and
Bruce Sterling's cyberpunk fables of hackerdom) is starting to take notice
of us for the first time in recent years in a positive light.
   
   Unfortunately, it has also gotten more dangerous since the early 80's.
Phone cops have more resources, more awareness, and more intelligence that they
exhibited in the past.  It is becoming more and more difficult to survive as
a hacker long enough to become skilled in the art.  To this end this file
is dedicated.  If it can help someone get started, and help them survive
to discover new systems and new information, it will have served it's purpose,
and served as a partial repayment to all the people who helped me out when I
was a beginner.

Part One: The Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers.  In the 50's
at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT), students devoted much time
and energy to ingenious exploration of the computers.  Rules and the law were
disregarded in their pursuit for the 'hack'.  Just as they were enthralled with
their pursuit of information, so are we.  The thrill of the hack is not in
breaking the law, it's in the pursuit and capture of knowledge.
    
   To this end, let me contribute my suggestions for guidelines to follow to
ensure that not only you stay out of trouble, but you pursue your craft without
damaging the computers you hack into or the companies who own them.

I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible.)
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier.
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.
V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you
      don't know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people
      that will validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems
      that are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the
      government has inifitely more time and resources to track you down than
      a company who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local telenet or tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800...)
      You use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.
      You may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you
      when you meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to
      death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working
      except in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or
      something generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that.)
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a begining hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.
XI.   Finally, you have to actually hack.  You can hang out on boards all you
      want, and you can read all the text files in the world, but until you
      actually start doing it, you'll never know what it's all about.  There's
      no thrill quite the same as getting into your first system (well, ok,
      I can think of a couple of bigger thrills, but you get the picture.)

   One of the safest places to start your hacking career is on a computer
system belonging to a college.  University computers have notoriously lax
security, and are more used to hackers, as every college computer depart-
ment has one or two, so are less likely to press charges if you should
be detected.  But the odds of them detecting you and having the personel to
committ to tracking you down are slim as long as you aren't destructive.

   If you are already a college student, this is ideal, as you can legally
explore your computer system to your heart's desire, then go out and look
for similar systems that you can penetrate with confidence, as you're already
familar with them.

   So if you just want to get your feet wet, call your local college.  Many of
them will provide accounts for local residents at a nominal (under $20) charge.

   Finally, if you get caught, stay quiet until you get a lawyer.  Don't vol-
unteer any information, no matter what kind of 'deals' they offer you.
Nothing is binding unless you make the deal through your lawyer, so you might
as well shut up and wait.

Part Two: Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The best place to begin hacking (other than a college) is on one of the
bigger networks such as Telenet.  Why?  First, there is a wide variety of
computers to choose from, from small Micro-Vaxen to huge Crays.  Second, the
networks are fairly well documented.  It's easier to find someone who can help
you with a problem off of Telenet than it is to find assistance concerning your
local college computer or high school machine.  Third, the networks are safer.
Because of the enormous number of calls that are fielded every day by the big
networks, it is not financially practical to keep track of where every call and
connection are made from.  It is also very easy to disguise your location using
the network, which makes your hobby much more secure.

   Telenet has more computers hooked to it than any other system in the world
once you consider that from Telenet you have access to Tymnet, ItaPAC, JANET,
DATAPAC, SBDN, PandaNet, THEnet, and a whole host of other networks, all of
which you can connect to from your terminal.

   The first step that you need to take is to identify your local dialup port.
This is done by dialing 1-800-424-9494 (1200 7E1) and connecting.  It will
spout some garbage at you and then you'll get a prompt saying 'TERMINAL='.
This is your terminal type.  If you have vt100 emulation, type it in now.  Or
just hit return and it will default to dumb terminal mode.

   You'll now get a prompt that looks like a @.  From here, type @c mail <cr>
and then it will ask for a Username.  Enter 'phones' for the username. When it
asks for a password, enter 'phones' again.  From this point, it is menu
driven.  Use this to locate your local dialup, and call it back locally.  If
you don't have a local dialup, then use whatever means you wish to connect to
one long distance (more on this later.)

   When you call your local dialup, you will once again go through the
TERMINAL= stuff, and once again you'll be presented with a @.  This prompt lets
you know you are connected to a Telenet PAD.  PAD stands for either Packet
Assembler/Disassembler (if you talk to an engineer), or Public Access Device
(if you talk to Telenet's marketing people.)  The first description is more
correct.

   Telenet works by taking the data you enter in on the PAD you dialed into,
bundling it into a 128 byte chunk (normally... this can be changed), and then
transmitting it at speeds ranging from 9600 to 19,200 baud to another PAD, who
then takes the data and hands it down to whatever computer or system it's
connected to.  Basically, the PAD allows two computers that have different baud
rates or communication protocols to communicate with each other over a long
distance.  Sometimes you'll notice a time lag in the remote machines response.
This is called PAD Delay, and is to be expected when you're sending data
through several different links.

   What do you do with this PAD?  You use it to connect to remote computer
systems by typing 'C' for connect and then the Network User Address (NUA) of
the system you want to go to.

   An NUA takes the form of   031103130002520
                              \___/\___/\___/
                                |    |    |
                                |    |    |____ network address

   There are two ways to find interesting addresses to connect to.  The first
and easiest way is to obtain a copy of the LOD/H Telenet Directory from the
LOD/H Technical Journal #4 or 2600 Magazine.  Jester Sluggo also put out a good
list of non-US addresses in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 21.  These files will
tell you the NUA, whether it will accept collect calls or not, what type of
computer system it is (if known) and who it belongs to (also if known.)

   The second method of locating interesting addresses is to scan for them
manually.  On Telenet, you do not have to enter the 03110 DNIC to connect to a
Telenet host.  So if you saw that 031104120006140 had a VAX on it you wanted to
look at, you could type @c 412 614 (0's can be ignored most of the time.)

   If this node allows collect billed connections, it will say 412 614
CONNECTED and then you'll possibly get an identifying header or just a
Username: prompt.  If it doesn't allow collect connections, it will give you a
message such as 412 614 REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION with some error codes out to
the right, and return you to the @ prompt.

   There are two primary ways to get around the REFUSED COLLECT message.  The
first is to use a Network User Id (NUI) to connect.  An NUI is a username/pw
combination that acts like a charge account on Telenet.  To collect to node
412 614 with NUI junk4248, password 525332, I'd type the following:
@c 412 614,junk4248,525332  <---- the 525332 will *not* be echoed to the
screen.  The problem with NUI's is that they're hard to come by unless you're
a good social engineer with a thorough knowledge of Telenet (in which case
you probably aren't reading this section), or you have someone who can
provide you with them.

   The second way to connect is to use a private PAD, either through an X.25
PAD or through something like Netlink off of a Prime computer (more on these
two below.)

   The prefix in a Telenet NUA oftentimes (not always) refers to the phone Area
Code that the computer is located in (i.e. 713 xxx would be a computer in
Houston, Texas.)  If there's a particular area you're interested in, (say,
New York City 914), you could begin by typing @c 914 001 <cr>.  If it connects,
you make a note of it and go on to 914 002.  You do this until you've found
some interesting systems to play with.

   Not all systems are on a simple xxx yyy address.  Some go out to four or
five digits (914 2354), and some have decimal or numeric extensions
(422 121A = 422 121.01).  You have to play with them, and you never know what
you're going to find.  To fully scan out a prefix would take ten million
attempts per prefix.  For example, if I want to scan 512 completely, I'd have
to start with 512 00000.00 and go through 512 00000.99, then increment the
address by 1 and try 512 00001.00 through 512 00001.99.  A lot of scanning.
There are plenty of neat computers to play with in a 3-digit scan, however,
so don't go berserk with the extensions.
   Sometimes you'll attempt to connect and it will just be sitting there after
one or two minutes.  In this case, you want to abort the connect attempt by
sending a hard break (this varies with different term programs, on Procomm,
it's ALT-B), and then when you get the @ prompt back, type 'D' for disconnect.

   If you connect to a computer and wish to disconnect, you can type <cr> @
<cr> and you it should say TELENET and then give you the @ prompt.  From there,
type D to disconnect or CONT to re-connect and continue your session
uninterrupted.

Outdials, Network Servers, and PADs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   In addition to computers, an NUA may connect you to several other things.
One of the most useful is the outdial.  An outdial is nothing more than a modem
you can get to over telenet- similar to the PC Pursuit concept, except that
these don't have passwords on them most of the time.

   When you connect, you will get a message like 'Hayes 1200 baud outdial,
Detroit, MI', or 'VEN-TEL 212 Modem', or possibly 'Session 1234 established
on Modem 5588'.  The best way to figure out the commands on these is to
type ? or H or HELP- this will get you all the information that you need to
use one.

   Safety tip here- when you are hacking *any* system through a phone dialup,
always use an outdial or a diverter, especially if it is a local phone number
to you.  More people get popped hacking on local computers than you can
imagine, Intra-LATA calls are the easiest things in the world to trace inexp-
ensively.

   Another nice trick you can do with an outdial is use the redial or macro
function that many of them have.  First thing you do when you connect is to
invoke the 'Redial Last Number' facility.  This will dial the last number used,
which will be the one the person using it before you typed.  Write down the
number, as no one would be calling a number without a computer on it.  This
is a good way to find new systems to hack.  Also, on a VENTEL modem, type 'D'
for Display and it will display the five numbers stored as macros in the
modem's memory.

   There are also different types of servers for remote Local Area Networks
(LAN) that have many machine all over the office or the nation connected to
them.  I'll discuss identifying these later in the computer ID section.

   And finally, you may connect to something that says 'X.25 Communication
PAD' and then some more stuff, followed by a new @ prompt.  This is a PAD
just like the one you are on, except that all attempted connections are billed
to the PAD, allowing you to connect to those nodes who earlier refused collect
connections.

   This also has the added bonus of confusing where you are connecting from.
When a packet is transmitted from PAD to PAD, it contains a header that has
the location you're calling from.  For instance, when you first connected
to Telenet, it might have said 212 44A CONNECTED if you called from the 212
area code.  This means you were calling PAD number 44A in the 212 area.
That 21244A will be sent out in the header of all packets leaving the PAD.
   Once you connect to a private PAD, however, all the packets going out
from *it* will have it's address on them, not yours.  This can be a valuable
buffer between yourself and detection.

Phone Scanning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Finally, there's the time-honored method of computer hunting that was made
famous among the non-hacker crowd by that Oh-So-Technically-Accurate movie
Wargames.  You pick a three digit phone prefix in your area and dial every
number from 0000 --> 9999 in that prefix, making a note of all the carriers
you find.  There is software available to do this for nearly every computer
in the world, so you don't have to do it by hand.

Part Three: I've Found a Computer, Now What?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This next section is applicable universally.  It doesn't matter how you
found this computer, it could be through a network, or it could be from
carrier scanning your High School's phone prefix, you've got this prompt
this prompt, what the hell is it?

   I'm *NOT* going to attempt to tell you what to do once you're inside of
any of these operating systems.  Each one is worth several G-files in its
own right.  I'm going to tell you how to identify and recognize certain
OpSystems, how to approach hacking into them, and how to deal with something
that you've never seen before and have know idea what it is.


VMS-       The VAX computer is made by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),
           and runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system.
           VMS is characterized by the 'Username:' prompt.  It will not tell
           you if you've entered a valid username or not, and will disconnect
           you after three bad login attempts.  It also keeps track of all
           failed login attempts and informs the owner of the account next time
           s/he logs in how many bad login attempts were made on the account.
           It is one of the most secure operating systems around from the
           outside, but once you're in there are many things that you can do
           to circumvent system security.  The VAX also has the best set of
           help files in the world.  Just type HELP and read to your heart's
           content.

DEC-10-    An earlier line of DEC computer equipment, running the TOPS-10
           operating system.  These machines are recognized by their
           '.' prompt.  The DEC-10/20 series are remarkably hacker-friendly,
           allowing you to enter several important commands without ever
           logging into the system.  Accounts are in the format [xxx,yyy] where
           xxx and yyy are integers.  You can get a listing of the accounts and
           the process names of everyone on the system before logging in with
           the command .systat (for SYstem STATus).  If you seen an account
           that reads [234,1001]   BOB JONES, it might be wise to try BOB or
           JONES or both for a password on this account.  To login, you type
           .login xxx,yyy  and then type the password when prompted for it.
           The system will allow you unlimited tries at an account, and does
           not keep records of bad login attempts.  It will also inform you
           if the UIC you're trying (UIC = User Identification Code, 1,2 for
           example) is bad.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:

UNIX-      There are dozens of different machines out there that run UNIX.
           While some might argue it isn't the best operating system in the
           world, it is certainly the most widely used.  A UNIX system will
           usually have a prompt like 'login:' in lower case.  UNIX also
           will give you unlimited shots at logging in (in most cases), and
           there is usually no log kept of bad attempts.
           Common Accounts/Defaults: (note that some systems are case
           sensitive, so use lower case as a general rule.  Also, many times
           the accounts will be unpassworded, you'll just drop right in!)

Prime-     Prime computer company's mainframe running the Primos operating
           system.  The are easy to spot, as the greet you with
           'Primecon 18.23.05' or the like, depending on the version of the
           operating system you run into.  There will usually be no prompt
           offered, it will just look like it's sitting there.  At this point,
           type 'login <username>'.  If it is a pre-18.00.00 version of Primos,
           you can hit a bunch of ^C's for the password and you'll drop in.
           Unfortunately, most people are running versions 19+.  Primos also
           comes with a good set of help files.  One of the most useful
           features of a Prime on Telenet is a facility called NETLINK.  Once
           you're inside, type NETLINK and follow the help files.  This allows
           you to connect to NUA's all over the world using the 'nc' command.
           For example, to connect to NUA 026245890040004, you would type
           @nc :26245890040004 at the netlink prompt.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           PRIME       PRIME or PRIMOS

HP-x000-   This system is made by Hewlett-Packard.  It is characterized by the
           ':' prompt.  The HP has one of the more complicated login sequences
           around- you type 'HELLO SESSION NAME,USERNAME,ACCOUNTNAME,GROUP'.
           Fortunately, some of these fields can be left blank in many cases.
           Since any and all of these fields can be passworded, this is not
           the easiest system to get into, except for the fact that there are
           usually some unpassworded accounts around.  In general, if the
           defaults don't work, you'll have to brute force it using the
           common password list (see below.)  The HP-x000 runs the MPE operat-
           ing system, the prompt for it will be a ':', just like the logon
           prompt.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:

IRIS-      IRIS stands for Interactive Real Time Information System.  It orig-
           inally ran on PDP-11's, but now runs on many other minis.  You can
           spot an IRIS by the 'Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.4 Timesharing' banner,
           and the ACCOUNT ID? prompt.  IRIS allows unlimited tries at hacking
           in, and keeps no logs of bad attempts.  I don't know any default
           passwords, so just try the common ones from the password database
           below.
           Common Accounts:

VM/CMS-    The VM/CMS operating system runs in International Business Machines
           (IBM) mainframes.  When you connect to one of these, you will get
           message similar to 'VM/370 ONLINE', and then give you a '.' prompt,
           just like TOPS-10 does.  To login, you type 'LOGON <username>'.
           Common Accounts/Defaults are:
           AUTOLOG1:            AUTOLOG or AUTOLOG1
           CMS:                 CMS

NOS-       NOS stands for Networking Operating System, and runs on the Cyber
           computer made by Control Data Corporation.  NOS identifies itself
           quite readily, with a banner of 'WELCOME TO THE NOS SOFTWARE
           SYSTEM.  COPYRIGHT CONTROL DATA 1978,1987'.  The first prompt you
           will get will be FAMILY:.  Just hit return here.  Then you'll get
           a USER NAME: prompt.  Usernames are typically 7 alpha-numerics
           characters long, and are *extremely* site dependent. Operator
           accounts begin with a digit, such as 7ETPDOC.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           $SYSTEM              unknown
           SYSTEMV              unknown

Decserver- This is not truly a computer system, but is a network server that
           has many different machines available from it.  A Decserver will
           say 'Enter Username>' when you first connect.  This can be anything,
           it doesn't matter, it's just an identifier.  Type 'c', as this is
           the least conspicuous thing to enter.  It will then present you
           with a 'Local>' prompt.  From here, you type 'c <systemname>' to
           connect to a system.  To get a list of system names, type
           'sh services' or 'sh nodes'.  If you have any problems, online
           help is available with the 'help' command.  Be sure and look for
           services named 'MODEM' or 'DIAL' or something similar, these are
           often outdial modems and can be useful!

GS/1-      Another type of network server.  Unlike a Decserver, you can't
           predict what prompt a GS/1 gateway is going to give you.  The
           default prompt it 'GS/1>', but this is redifinable by the
           system administrator.  To test for a GS/1, do a 'sh d'.  If that
           prints out a large list of defaults (terminal speed, prompt,
           parity, etc...), you are on a GS/1.  You connect in the same manner
           as a Decserver, typing 'c <systemname>'.  To find out what systems
           are available, do a 'sh n' or a 'sh c'.  Another trick is to do a
           'sh m', which will sometimes show you a list of macros for logging
           onto a system.  If there is a macro named VAX, for instance, type
           'do VAX'.

           The above are the main system types in use today.  There are
           hundreds of minor variants on the above, but this should be
           enough to get you started.

Unresponsive Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Occasionally you will connect to a system that will do nothing but sit
there.  This is a frustrating feeling, but a methodical approach to the system
will yield a response if you take your time.  The following list will usually
make *something* happen.

1)  Change your parity, data length, and stop bits.  A system that won't re-
    spond at 8N1 may react at 7E1 or 8E2 or 7S2.  If you don't have a term
    program that will let you set parity to EVEN, ODD, SPACE, MARK, and NONE,
    with data length of 7 or 8, and 1 or 2 stop bits, go out and buy one.
    While having a good term program isn't absolutely necessary, it sure is
    helpful.
2)  Change baud rates.  Again, if your term program will let you choose odd
    baud rates such as 600 or 1100, you will occasionally be able to penetrate
    some very interesting systems, as most systems that depend on a strange
    baud rate seem to think that this is all the security they need...
3)  Send a series of <cr>'s.
4)  Send a hard break followed by a <cr>.
5)  Type a series of .'s (periods).  The Canadian network Datapac responds
    to this.
6)  If you're getting garbage, hit an 'i'.  Tymnet responds to this, as does
    a MultiLink II.
7)  Begin sending control characters, starting with ^A --> ^Z.
8)  Change terminal emulations.  What your vt100 emulation thinks is garbage
    may all of a sudden become crystal clear using ADM-5 emulation.  This also
    relates to how good your term program is.
9)  Type LOGIN, HELLO, LOG, ATTACH, CONNECT, START, RUN, BEGIN, LOGON, GO,
    JOIN, HELP, and anything else you can think of.
10) If it's a dialin, call the numbers around it and see if a company
    answers.  If they do, try some social engineering.

Brute Force Hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There will also be many occasions when the default passwords will not work
on an account.  At this point, you can either go onto the next system on your
list, or you can try to 'brute-force' your way in by trying a large database
of passwords on that one account.  Be careful, though!  This works fine on
systems that don't keep track of invalid logins, but on a system like a VMS,
someone is going to have a heart attack if they come back and see '600 Bad
Login Attempts Since Last Session' on their account.  There are also some
operating systems that disconnect after 'x' number of invalid login attempts
and refuse to allow any more attempts for one hour, or ten minutes, or some-
times until the next day.

   The following list is taken from my own password database plus the data-
base of passwords that was used in the Internet UNIX Worm that was running
around in November of 1988.  For a shorter group, try first names, computer
terms, and obvious things like 'secret', 'password', 'open', and the name
of the account.  Also try the name of the company that owns the computer
system (if known), the company initials, and things relating to the products
the company makes or deals with.

Association.  All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to reprint

 The FBI maintains several computer systems.  The most common of which is
call NCIC (National Crime Information Computer). NCIC maintains a database of
information about such things as stolen cars, stolen boats, missing persons,
wanted persons, arrest records. It provides quick access to these records by
State, Local and Federal law enforcement agencies.  NCIC is directly linked
with the Treasury Department's TECS computer and many State computer systems.
According to William H. Webster, Director of the FBI:

When a police officer stops a car and is uncertain about who he's going to
meet when he gets out, he can plug into this system [NCIC] and in a matter of
a few seconds he can find out whether that person is a fugitive or the
automobile is stolen. Incidentally, we receive almost 400,000 inquires of
this nature each day in the NCIC system.

 When an agency determines that a subject is a fugitive, it supplies the FBI
computer with as much of the following information as possible: 1) Name and
case number; 2) Alias; 3) Race; 4) Sex; 5) Height; 6) Weight; 7) Color of
hair; 8) Color of eyes; 9) Description of any identifying scars, marks and
tattoos; 10) Date of birth; 11) Place of birth; 12) Social Security Number;
13) Passport Number; 14) Last known address; 15) Nationality; 16) If a
naturalized U.S. Citizen, date, place, and certificate number; 17)
Occupation; 18) The criminal violation with which subject is charged; 19)
Date of warrant; 21) Type of warrant -- Bench, Magistrate, etc.; 22) Agency
holding warrant; 23) Any information as to whether the subject is considered
dangerous, is known to own or currently possess firearms, has suicidal
tendencies, or has previously escaped custody; 24) Driver's license number,
year of expiration and State issued; 25) License number of vehicle, aircraft
or vessel subject owns or is known to use, include the year and State; 26)
Description of vehicle, aircraft or vessel subject owns or is known to use;
27) Associates of the subject*1; 28) FBI number; 29) Name and telephone of
the person to contact when subject is apprehended.

 One of the major problems with the system is that the agency that submits an
entry is responsible for keeping it up to date. Once an entry has been made,
there is little motivation for the originating agency to "waste" its time
keeping it up to date, so many entries become incorrect with the passage of
time.

 Another FBI computer system is their Investigative Support Information
System (ISIS). This system is only used to provide support for major
investigations that require the handling of a large volume of complex
information.  It is limited to handling a maximum of 20 cases at a time.

 The ISIS system was used during the investigation of the murder of Federal
Judge John Wood in San Antonio, Texas. In this case, the FBI entered 300,000
pieces of information, including 6,000 interviews, hotel registration
information from every hotel in the area, etc.  The accused, while on trial,
claimed he was several hundred miles away.  The FBI cross referenced his name
& known alias with the hotel registration database and got a match. Contact
with the hotel employees resulted in a positive identification and conviction
of the subject.

 The FBI has a system called the Organized Crime Information Systems (OCIS)
of which director William Webster is "particularly proud."  The system was
started in 1980 in Detroit, Michigan and is one of their most sophisticated
computers. The system is now functions in over 40 locations.

 The OCIS system allows agents in different field offices to share and
analyze information collected in each other's areas.  This system was used to
identify some of the United States citizens who were released from Cuban
prisons in 1984 that had criminal histories in the United States. An OCIS
link was recently opened in Rome, where it's used to support drug
investigations.

      1XB - No.1 Crossbar system. See XBAR for more information.
 
      2600   -  A  hack/phreak  oriented  newsletter  that  periodically  was 
 released  and still is being released. See Phile 1.6 for more information on 
 the magazine and ordering.
 
      4XB - No.4 Crossbar system. See XBAR for more information.
 
      5XB  -  No.5  Crossbar  system.  The  primary end office switch of Bell 
 since the 60's and still in limited use. See XBAR for more detail.
 
      700  Services  -  These services are reserved as an advanced forwarding 
 system,  where the forwarding is advanced to a user-programed location which 
 could be changed by the user.
 
      800  Exceptional  Calling  Report  - System set up by ESS that will log 
 any  caller  that excessively dials 800 numbers or directory assistance. See 
 ESS for more information.
 
      800  Services  -  Also known as WATS. These services often contain WATS 
 extenders  which,  when  used  with  a code, may be used to call LD. Many LD 
 companies  use  these services because they are toll-free to customers. Most 
 800  extenders  are  considered  dangerous  because most have the ability to 
 trace.
 
      900  Services  -  Numbers  in  the  900 SAC usually are used as special 
 services,  such  as  TV polls and such. These usually are $.50 for the first 
 minute  and  $.35 for each additional minute. Dial (900)555-1212 to find out 
 what the 900 services currently have to offer.
 
      950  -  A  nationwide  access exchange in most areas. Many LD companies 
 have  extenders located somewhere on this exchange; however, all services on 
 this  exchange  are  considered dangerous due to the fact that they ALL have 
 the ability to trace. Most 950 services have crystal clear connections.
 
      ACCS  -  Automated  Calling  Card  Service.  The typical 0+NPA+Nxx+xxxx 
 method  of  inputting  calling cards and then you input the calling card via 
 touch tones. This would not be possible without ACTS.
 
      ACD - Automatic Call Distributor.
 
      ACD  Testing Mode - Automatic Call Distributor Test Mode. This level of 
 phreaking  can  be  obtained  by pressing the "D" key down after calling DA. 
 This  can  only  be done in areas that have the ACD. The ACD Testing Mode is 
 characterized  by  a pulsing dial tone. From here, you can get one side of a 
 loop  by  dialing  6,  the  other side is 7. You may also be able to REMOB a 
 line.  All  possibilities  of  the ACD Test have not been experimented with. 
 See silver box for more details.
 
      ACTS  -  Automated  Coin  Toll  Service. This is a computer system that 
 automates  phortress  fone  service by listening for red box tones and takes 
 appropriate  action.  It is this service that is commonly heard saying, "Two 
 dollars  please.  Please  deposit  two  dollars for the next three minutes." 
 Also,  if  you  talk for more than three minutes and then hang up, ACTS will 
 call back and demand your money. ACTS is also responsible for ACCS.
 
      Alliance  -  A  teleconferencing  system  that is apart from AT&T which 
 allows  the general public to access and use its conferencing equipment. The 
 equipment   allows  group  conversations  with  members  participating  from 
 throughout  the United States. The fone number to Alliance generally follows 
 the  format  of 0-700-456-x00x depending on the location the call originates 
 from and is not accessible direct by all cities/states.
 
      AMA  -  Automated  Message  Accounting. Similar to the CAMA system; see 
 CAMA for more info.
 
      analog  -  As  used  for  a  word  or data transmission, a continuously 
 varying electrical signal in the shape of a wave.
 
      ANI  -  Automatic  Number  Identification  - This is the system you can 
 call,  usually  a  three digit number or one in the 99xx's of your exchange, 
 and  have  the  originating  number  you  are  calling from read to you by a 
 computer.  This is useful if you don't know the number you are calling from, 
 for  finding  diverters,  and  when  you  are playing around with other fone 
 equipment  like  cans  or  beige boxes. The ANI system is often incorporated 
 into  other  fone  companies  such as Sprint and MCI in order to trace those 
 big bad phreaks that abuze codez.
 
      ANIF  - Automatic Number Identification Failure. When the ANI system of 
 a particular office fails. 
 
      APF  -  All  PINs Fail. This is a security measure which is designed to 
 frustrate attempts at discovering valid PINs by a hacking method.
 
      aqua  box  -  A  box  designed to drain the voltage of the FBI lock-in-
 trace/trap-trace  so  you  can  hang  up  your  fone  in  an  emergency  and 
 phrustrate  the  Pheds  some more. The apparatus is simple, just connect the 
 two  middle wires of a phone wire and plug, which would be the red and green 
 wires  if  in  the jack, to the cord of some electrical appliance; ie, light 
 bulb  or  radio.  KEEP  THE  APPLIANCE  OFF.  Then,  get  one  of those line 
 splitters  that  will  let  you hook two phone plugs into one jack. Plug the 
 end  of  the  modified  cord into one jack and your fone into the other. THE 
 APPLIANCE  MUST  BE  OFF! Then, when the Pheds turn their lame tracer on and 
 you  find  that  you  can't hang up, remove your fone from the jack and turn 
 the  appliance ON and keep it ON until you feel safe; it may be awhile. Then 
 turn  it  off,  plug  your fone back in, and start phreaking again. Invented 
 by: Captain Xerox and The Traveler.
 
      BAUDOT - 45.5 baud. Also known as the Apple Cat Can.
 
      BEF  - Band Elimination Filter. A muting system that will mute the 2600 
 Hz tone which signals hang-up when you hang up.
 
      beige  box  - An apparatus that is a home-made lineman's handset. It is 
 a  regular  fone  that  has  clips  where  the  red and green wires normally 
 connect  to  in  a  fone jack. These clips will attach to the rings and tips 
 found  in  many  of  MA's output devices. These are highly portable and VERY 
 useful  when  messing  around  with  cans  and other output devices the fone 
 company has around. Invented by: The Exterminator and The Terminal Man.
 
      BITNET  -  Nationwide  system for colleges and schools which accesses a 
 large  base  of  education-oriented information. Access ports are always via 
 mainframe.
 
      bit  stream  -  Refers  to  a continuous series of bits, binary digits, 
 being transmitted on a transmission line.
 
      black  box  -  The infamous box that allows the calling party to not be 
 billed  for  the call placed. We won't go in depth right now, most plans can 
 be  found on many phreak oriented BBS's. The telco can detect black boxes if 
 they suspect one on the line. Also, these will not work under ESS.
 
      bleeper  boxes  -  The  United  Kingdom's  own version of the blue box, 
 modified  to  work  with the UK's fone system. Based on the same principles. 
 However, they use two sets of frequencies, foreword and backwards.
 
      Blotto  box  -  This  box  supposedly  shorts  every  fone  out  in the 
 immediate  area,  and  I  don't  doubt  it. It should kill every fone in the 
 immediate  area,  until  the  voltage reaches the fone company, and the fone 
 company  filters  it.  I  won't  cover  this  one  in  this issue, cuz it is 
 dangerous,  and  phreaks shouldn't destroy MA's equipment, just phuck it up. 
 Look  for  this  on your phavorite BBS or ask your phavorite phreak for info 
 if you really are serious about seriously phucking some fones in some area.
 
      blue  box  -  An  old  piece of equipment that emulated a true operator 
 placing  calls,  and  operators  get  calls for free. The blue box seizes an 
 open  trunk  by  blasting  a  2600  Hz tone through the line after dialing a 
 party  that  is  local  or in the 800 NPA so calls will be local or free for 
 the  blue boxer. Then, when the blue boxer has seized a trunk, the boxer may 
 then,  within the next 10-15 seconds, dial another fone number via MF tones. 
 These  MF  tones  must be preceded by a KP tone and followed with a ST tone. 
 All of these tones are standardized by Bell. The tones as well as the inter-
 digit  intervals  are around 75ms. It may vary with the equipment used since 
 ESS  can  handle higher speeds and doesn't need inter-digit intervals. There 
 are  many  uses to a blue box, and we will not cover any more here. See your 
 local  phreak or phreak oriented BBS for in depth info concerning blue boxes 
 and  blue  boxing.  Incidentally, blue boxes are not considered safe anymore 
 because  ESS  detects  "foreign"  tones,  such as the 2600 Hz tone, but this 
 detection  may  be  delayed  by  mixing pink noise of above 3000 Hz with the 
 2600  Hz  tone. To hang up, the 2600 Hz tone is played again. Also, all blue 
 boxes  are  green  boxes because MF "2" corresponds to the Coin Collect tone 
 on  the  green box, and the "KP" tone corresponds to the Coin Return tone on 
 the  green  box.  See  green  box  for  more  information.  Blue  boxing  is 
 IMPOSSIBLE  under  the new CCIS system slowly being integrated into the Bell 
 system.
 
      blue  box  tones  -  The MF tones generated by the blue box in order to 
 place  calls,  emulating  a  true operator. These dual tones must be entered 
 during  the  10-15 second period after you have seized a trunk with the 2600 
 Hz tone.                                                                   
                         700:  1 :  2 :  4 :  7 : 11 :    KP= Key Pulse     
  Parallel Frequencies   900: ** :  3 :  5 :  8 : 12 :    ST= STop          
    2= Coin Collect     1100: ** : ** :  6 :  9 : KP :   KP2= Key Pulse 2   
   KP= Coin Return      1300: ** : ** : ** : 10 :KP2 :    **= None          
   (green box tones)    1500: ** : ** : ** : ** : ST :                      
                            : 900:1100:1300:1500:1700:   75ms pulse/pause   
 
      BLV  -  Busy  Line  Verification.  Allows  a TSPS operator to process a 
 customer's  request  for  a  confirmation  of  a  repeatedly busy line. This 
 service is used in conjunction with emergency break-ins.
 
      BNS - Billed Number Screening.
 
      break  period  -  Time  when  the  circuit during pulse dialing is left 
 open.  In  the  US,  this period is 40ms; foreign nations may use 33ms break 
 periods.
 
      break  ratio  -  The  interval  pulse dialing breaks and makes the loop 
 when  dialing.  The US standard is 10 pulses per second. When the circuit is 
 opened,  it  is called the break interval. When the circuit is closed, it is 
 called  the make interval. In the US, there is a 60ms make period and a 40ms 
 break  period.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  a 60% make interval. Many 
 foreign nations have a 67% make interval.
 
      bridge - I don't really understand  this  one, but  these  are important
phreak toys. I'll cover them more in the next issue of TPH.

      British Post Office - The United Kingdom's equivalent to Ma Bell.
 
      busy  box  - Box that will cause the fone to be busy, without taking it 
 OFF-HOOK.  Just  get a piece of fone wire with a plug on the end, cut it off 
 so  there  is a plug and about two inches of fone line. Then, strip the wire 
 so  the  two middle wires, the tip and the ring, are exposed. Then, wrap the 
 ring  and  the  tip  together,  tape with electrical tape, and plug into the 
 fone jack. The fone will be busy until the box is removed.
 
      cans  -  Cans  are  those  big  silver  boxes  on  top of or around the 
 telephone  poles. When opened, the lines can be manipulated with a beige box 
 or whatever phun you have in mind.
 
      calling  card  -  Another  form of the LD service used by many major LD 
 companies  that  composes of the customers fone number and a PIN number. The 
 most  important  thing  to  know when questioned about calling cards are the 
 area code and the city where the calling card customer originated from.
 
      CAMA  -  Centralized  Automatic Message Accounting. System that records 
 the  numbers called by fones and other LD systems. The recording can be used 
 as evidence in court.
 
      CC - Calling Card.
 
      CC - Credit Card.
 
      CCIS   -  Common  Channel  Inter-office  Signaling.  New  method  being 
 incorporated  under  Bell  that will send all the signaling information over 
 separate data lines. Blue boxing is IMPOSSIBLE under this system.
 
      CCITT  -  The  initials  of  the  name  in  French of the International 
 Telegraph  and Telephone Consultative Committee. At CCITT representatives of 
 telecommunications  authorities,  operators  of  public  networks  and other 
 interested  bodies  meet  to  agree  on  standards  needed for international 
 intermarrying of telecommunications services.
 
      CCS - Calling Card Service.
 
      CCSS   -  Common  Channel  Signalling  System.  A  system  whereby  all 
 signalling  for a number of voice paths are carried over one common channel, 
 instead of within each individual channel.
 
      CDA - Coin Detection and Announcement.
 
      CF  -  Coin First. A type of fortress fone that wants your money before 
 you receive a dial tone.
 
      Channel  - A means of one-way transmission or a UCA path for electrical 
 transmission  between  two  or  more points without common carrier, provided 
 terminal equipment. Also called a circuit, line, link, path, or facility.
 
      cheese  box  -  Another  type  of  box  which,  when  coupled with call 
 forwarding  services, will allow one to place free fone calls. The safety of 
 this  box  is unknown. See references for information concerning text philes 
 on this box.
 
      clear  box  - Piece of equipment that compromises of a telephone pickup 
 coil  and  a  small  amp. This works on the principal that all receivers are 
 also  weak  transmitters.  So,  you amplify your signal on PP fortress fones 
 and spare yourself some change.
 
      CN/A  -  Customer  Name  And  Address.  Systems  where  authorized Bell 
 employees  can  find  out  the  name and address of any customer in the Bell 
 System.  All  fone  numbers  are listed on file, including unlisted numbers. 
 Some  CN/A  services ask for ID#'s when you make a request. To use, call the 
 CN/A  office  during  normal  business hours, and say that you are so and so 
 from  a  certain  business or office, related to customers or something like 
 that,  and  you  need the customer's name and address at (NPA)Nxx-xxxx. That 
 should  work.  The  operators  to  these  services usually know more than DA 
 operators  do  and  are  also  susceptible  to  "social  engineering." It is 
 possible  to  bullshit  a CN/A operator for the NON PUB DA number and policy 
 changes in the CN/A system.
 
      CO  Code  - Central Office code which is also the Nxx code. See Nxx for 
 more details. Sometimes known as the local end office.
 
      conference  calls  - To have multiple lines inter-connected in order to 
 have  many  people talking in the same conversation on the fone at once. See 
 Alliance and switch crashing for more information.
 
      credit  operator - Same as TSPS operator. The operator you get when you 
 dial "0" on your fone and phortress fones. See TSPS for more information.
 
      CSDC  -  Circuit Switched Digital Capability. Another USDN service that 
 has no ISDN counterpart.
 
      DA - Directory Assistance. See directory assistance.
 
      DAO - Directory Assistance Operator. See directory assistance.
 
      data   communications   -   In   telefone   company  terminology,  data 
 communications   refers  to  an  end-to-end  transmission  of  any  kind  of 
 information  other  than  sound, including voice, or video. Data sources may 
 be either digital or analog.
 
      data  rate - The rate at which a channel carries data, measured in bits 
 per second, bit/s, also known as "data signalling rate."
 
      data signalling rate - Same as "data rate." See data rate.
 
      DCO-CS - Digital Central Office-Carrier Switch.
 
      DDD - Direct Distance Dialed.
 
      Dial-It Services - See 900 Services.
 
      digital  -  A  method  to  represent  information  to  be  discrete  or 
 individually  distinct  signals,  such as bits, as opposed to a continuously 
 variable analog signal.
 
      digital  transmission - A mode of transmission in which all information 
 to  be  transmitted  is first converted to digital form and then transmitted 
 as  a  serial  stream of pulses. Any signal, voice, data, television, can be 
 converted to digital form.
 
      Dimension 2000 - Another LD service located at (800)848-9000.
 
      directory  assistance  -  Operator  that  you get when you call 411 or   
 NPA-555-1212.  This call will cost $.50 per call. These won't know where you 
 are  calling from, unless you annoy them, and do not have access to unlisted 
 numbers.  There  are  also  directory assistance operators for the deaf that 
 transfer  BAUDOT. You can call these and have interesting conversations. The 
 fone  number is 800-855-1155, are free, and use standard Telex abbreviations 
 such  as  GA  for  Go  Ahead. These are nicer than normal operators, and are 
 often   subject   to   "social  engineering"  skills  (bullshitting).  Other 
 operators   also   have   access   to  their  own  directory  assistance  at 
 KP+NPA+131+ST.
 
      diverter  - This is a nice phreak tool. What a diverter is is a type of 
 call  forwarding  system done externally, apart from the fone company, which 
 is  a piece of hardware that will foreword the call to somewhere else. These 
 can  be  found  on  many  24 hour plumbers, doctors, etc. When you call, you 
 will  often  hear  a  click  and then ringing, or a ring, then a click, then 
 another  ring,  the second ring often sounds different from the first. Then, 
 the  other  side  picks  the  fone  up  and  you  ask about their company or 
 something  stupid, but DO NOT ANNOY them. Then eventually, let them hang up, 
 DO  NOT  HANG  UP  YOURSELF.  Wait  for the dial tone, then dial ANI. If the 
 number  ANI  reads  is different from the one you are calling from, then you 
 have  a  diverter.  Call  anywhere you want, for all calls will be billed to 
 the  diverter.  Also,  if  someone uses a tracer on you, then they trace the 
 diverter  and  you  are safe. Diverters can, however, hang up on you after a 
 period  of  time; some companies make diverters that can be set to clear the 
 line  after  a  set period of time, or click every once in a while, which is 
 super  annoying, but it will still work. Diverters are usually safer than LD 
 extenders,  but  there are no guarantees. Diverters can also be accessed via 
 phortress  fones.  Dial  the  credit  operator  and  ask for the AT&T CREDIT 
 OPERATOR.  They  will  put on some lame recording that is pretty long. Don't 
 say  anything  and  the  recording will hang up. LET IT HANG UP, DO NOT HANG 
 UP.  Then  the  line will clear and you will get a dial tone. Place any call 
 you  want  with  the following format: 9+1+NPA+Nxx+xxxx, or for local calls, 
 just  9+Nxx+xxxx. I'd advise that you call ANI first as a local call to make 
 sure you have a diverter.
 
      DLS - Dial Line Service.
 
      DNR - Also known as pen register. See pen register.
 
      DOV - Data-Over-Voice.
 
      DSI  -  Data  Subscriber  Interface.  Unit in the LADT system that will 
 concentrate  data  from  123  subscribers  to a 56k or a 9.6k bit-per-second 
 trunk to a packet network.
 
      DT - Dial tone.
 
      DTF  -  Dial Tone First. This is a type of fortress fone that gives you 
 a dial tone first.
 
      DTI - Digital Trunk Interface.
 
      DTMF  - Dual-Tone-Multi-Frequency, the generic term for the touch tone. 
 These  include  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  as  well as A,B,C,D. See silver box for 
 more details.
 
      DVM  -  Data  Voice  Multiplexor.  A system that squeezes more out of a 
 transmission  medium  and  allows  a  customer  to  transmit  voice and data 
 simultaneously to more than one receiver over the existing telefone line.
 
      emergency  break-in  -  Name given to the art of "breaking" into a busy 
 number  which  will  usually  result  in  becoming a third party in the call 
 taking place.
 
      end office - Any class 5 switching office in North America.
 
      end-to-end  signalling  -  A  mode  of  network  operation in which the 
 originating   central  office,  or  station,  retains  control  and  signals 
 directly  to  each successive central office, or PBX, as trunks are added to 
 the connection.
 
      ESS  - Electronic Switching System. "The phreak's nightmare come true." 
 With  ESS,  EVERY  SINGLE  digit  you  dial  is recorded, even mistakes. The 
 system  records  who  you  call, when you call, how long you talked, and, in 
 some  cases,  what  you  talked  about.  ESS  is programed to make a list of 
 people  who make excessive 800 calls or directory assistance. This is called 
 the  "800  Exceptional  Calling  Report."  ESS can be programed to print out 
 logs  of  who called certain numbers, such as a bookie, a known communist, a 
 BBS,  etc.  ESS is a series of programs working together; these programs can 
 be  very  easily  changed  to  do whatever the fone company wants ESS to do. 
 With  ESS,  tracing  is  done in MILLISECONDS and will pick up any "foreign" 
 tones  on the line, such as 2600 Hz. Bell predicts the whole country will be 
 on  ESS  by  1990!  You can identify an ESS office by the functions, such as 
 dialing  911  for  help, fortress fones with DT first, special services such 
 as  call forwarding, speed dialing, call waiting, etc., and ANI on LD calls. 
 Also, black boxes and Infinity transmitters will NOT work under ESS.
 
      extender  -  A  fone  line  that serves as a middleman for a fone call, 
 such  as  the  800  or 950 extenders. These systems usually require a multi-
 digit code and have some sort of ANI to trace suspicious calls with.
 
      facsimile  -  A  system  for  the  transmission of images. The image is 
 scanned  at  the  transmitter,  reconstructed  at the receiving station, and 
 duplicated on some form of paper. Also known as a FAX.
 
      FAX - See facsimile for details.
 
      FiRM - A large cracking group who is slowly taking the place of PTL and
the endangered cracking groups at the time of this writing.

      fortress  phone  - Today's modern, armor plated, pay fone. These may be 
 the  older,  3  coin/coin  first  fones or the newer, 1 coin/DT first fones. 
 There  are  also  others, see CF, DTF, and PP. Most phortresses can be found 
 in the 9xxx or 98xx series of your local Nxx.
 
      gateway city - See ISC.
 
      Gestapo  - The telefone company's security force. These nasties are the 
 ones  that  stake  out  misused  phortresses  as  well as go after those bad 
 phreaks that might be phucking with the fone system.
 
      green  base - A type of output device used by the fone company. Usually 
 light  green  in  color  and stick up a few feet from the ground. See output 
 device for more information.
 
      green  box - Equipment that will emulate the Coin Collect, Coin Return, 
 and  Ringback  tones.  This  means  that if you call someone with a fortress 
 fone  and  they  have  a  green  box,  by  activating it, your money will be 
 returned.   The   tones   are,   in   hertz,   Coin  Collect=700+1100,  Coin 
 Return=1100+1700,  and  Ringback=700+1700.  However,  before these tones are 
 sent,  the  MF  detectors  at  the  CO  must be alerted, this can be done by 
 sending  a  900+1500  Hz  or  single 2600 Hz wink of 90ms followed by a 60ms 
 gap, and then the appropriate signal for at least 900ms.
 
      gold  box  -  This  box  will  trace  calls,  tell if the call is being 
 traced, and can change a trace. 
 
      grey box - Also known as a silver box. See silver box.
 
      group  chief  -  The  name  of the highest ranking official in any fone 
 office. Ask to speak to these if an operator is giving you trouble.

 bits per second.
 
      H/M - Hotel/Motel.
 
      ICH - International Call Handling. Used for overseas calls.
 
      ICVT - InComing Verification Trunk.
 
      IDA  -  Integrated  Digital  Access. The United Kingdom's equivalent of 
 ISDN.
 
      IDDD  -  International  Direct  Distance Dialing - The ability to place 
 international  calls  direct  without processing through a station. Usually, 
 one  would  have to place the call through a 011, station, or a 01, operator 
 assisted, type of setup.
 
      IDN  -  Integrated  Digital  Networks.  Networks  which provide digital 
 access and transmission, in both circuit switched and packet modes.
 
      in-band  -  The  method of sending signaling information along with the 
 conversion using tones to represent digits.
 
      INS - Information Network System. Japan's equivalent of ISDN.
 
      Intercept  -  The  intercept  operator  is the one you get connected to 
 when  there  are not enough recordings available to tell you that the number 
 has  been  disconnected  or  changed.  These usually ask what number you are 
 calling and are the lowest form of the operator.
 
      intermediate  point  -  Any class 4X switching office in North America. 
 Also known as an RSU.
 
      international  dialing  -  In order to call across country borders, one 
 must  use  the  format PREFIX + COUNTRY CODE + NATION #. The prefix in North 
 America  is  usually  011  for  station-to-station calls or 01 for operator-
 assisted calls. If you have IDDD, you don't need to place this prefix in.
 
      INTT - Incoming No Test Trunks.
 
      INWARD  -  An  operator  that  assists  your local TSPS '0' operator in 
 connecting  calls.  These  won't  question you as long as the call is within 
 their  service  area. The operator can ONLY be reached by other operators or 
 a  blue  box.  The  blue box number is KP+NPA+121+ST for the INWARD operator 
 that will help you connect to any calls in that area ONLY. 
 
      INWATS  -  Inward  Wide  Area Telecommunications Service. These are the 
 800  numbers  we  are all familiar with. These are set up in bands; 6 total. 
 Band  6  is the largest, and you can call band 6 INWATS from anywhere in the 
 US  except  the  state  where  the call is terminated. This is also why some 
 companies  have  a  separate 800 number for their state. Band 5 includes the 
 48  contiguous  states.  All the way down to band 1, which only includes the 
 states  contiguous to that one. Understand? That means more people can reach 
 a band 6 INWATS as compared to the people that can access a band 1 INWATS.
 
      IOCC  -  International  Overseas Completion Centre. A system which must 
 be  dialed  in  order  to  re-route fone calls to countries inaccessible via 
 dialing  direct.  To  route a call via IOCC with a blue box, pad the country 
 code  to  the RIGHT with zeroes until it is 3 digits. Then KP+160 is dialed, 
 plus the padded country code, plus ST.
 
      IPM  -  Interruptions  Per  Minute.  The number of times a certain tone 
 sounds during a minute.
 
      ISC  -  Inter-Nation  Switching  Centers.  Most  outgoing  calls from a 
 certain  numbering  system  will be routed through these "gateway cities" in 
 order to reach a foreign country. 
 
      ISDN   -  Integrated  Services  Digital  Network.  ISDN  is  a  planned 
 hierarchy  of  digital  switching  and transmission systems. Synchronized so 
 that  all  digital elements speak the same "language" at the same speed, the 
 ISDN would provide voice, data, and video in a unified manner.
 
      ITT  -  This  is  another large LD service. The extenders owned by this 
 company    are    usually    considered    dangerous.    The    format    is
 ACC-ESS#,(NPA)Nxx-xxxx,1234567.
 
      KP  -  Key  Pulse.  Tone that must be generated before inputting a fone 
 number using a blue box. This tone is, in hertz, 1100+1700.
 
      KP2  - Key Pulse 2. Tone that is used by the CCITT SYSTEM 5 for special 
 international calling. This tone is, in hertz, 1300+1700.
 
      LADT  -  Local Area Data Transport. LADT is a method by which customers 
 will send and receive digital data over existing customer loop wiring. Dial-
 Up  LADT  will  let  customers use their lines for occasional data services; 
 direct  access LADT will transmit simultaneous voice and data traffic on the 
 same line.
 
      LAN - Local Area Network.
 
      LAPB - Link Access Protocol Balanced. 
 
      LD - Long Distance
 
      Leave Word And Call Back - Another new type of operator.
 
      local  loop  -  When  a loop is connected between you and your CO. This 
 occurs when you pick the fone up or have a fone OFF-HOOK.
 
      loop  -  A  pair  or group of fone lines. When people call these lines, 
 they  can  talk  to  each  other. Loops consist of two or more numbers, they 
 usually  are  grouped  close  together somewhere in the Nxx-99xx portions of 
 your  exchange.  The lower number in a loop is the tone side of the loop, or 
 the  singing switch. The higher number is always silent. The tone disappears 
 on  the  lower  #  when someone dials the other side of the loop. If you are 
 the  higher  #,  you  will  have  to  listen to the clicks to see if someone 
 dialed  into  the  loop. There also are such things as Non-Supervised loops, 
 where  the call is toll-free to the caller. Most loops will be muted or have 
 annoying  clicks  at  connection, but otherwise, you might find these useful 
 goodies  scanning  the  99xx's in your exchange. Some loops allow multi-user 
 capability;  thus,  many  people  can talk to each other at the same time, a 
 conference  of  sorts.  Since loops are genuine test functions for the telco 
 during the day, most phreaks scan and use them at night. 
 
      MA  -  Ma  Bell,  the Bell Telesys Company. Telco, etc. See Ma Bell for 
 more information.
 
      Ma  Bell  -  The telephone company. The Bell Telesys Phone Company. The 
 company  you  phreak  and  hack  with. The company that doesn't like you too 
 much.  The company you often phuck with, and sometimes phuck up. The company 
 that can phuck u up if u aren't careful.
 
      make  period  -  The  time  when,  during pulse dialing, the circuit is 
 closed.  In  the US, this period is 60ms; however, foreign nations may use a 
 67ms  make  period.  Make  periods are also referred to in percentages, so a 
 60ms make period would be 60%, a 67ms as 67%.
 
      marine verify - Another type of operator.
 
      MCI  -  Yet  another  LD service that owns many dial-ups in most areas. 
 However,  the  codes from various areas may not be interchangeable. Not much 
 is  known  about  MCI;  however,  MCI  probably has some sophisticated anti-
 phreak equipment. The format is ACC-ESS#,12345,(NPA)Nxx-xxxx.
 
      MCI  Execunet  -  The  calling  card  equivalent  of the regular MCI LD 
 service,  but the codes are longer and interchangeable. For the local access 
 port  near  you,  call  (800)555-1212.  The  format  for  the  port  will be
 ACC-ESS#,1234567,(NPA)Nxx-xxxx.
 
      Metrofone  -  Owned  by Western Union. A very popular system among fone 
 phreaks.  Call  Metrofone's  operator and ask for the local access number at 
 (800)325-1403.  The  format  is  ACC-ESS#,CODE,(NPA)Nxx-xxxx.  Metrofone  is 
 alleged to place trap codes on phreak BBS's. 
 
      MF  - Multi-Frequency. These are the operator and blue box tones. An MF 
 tone  consists  of  two  tones  from  a  set  of  six master tones which are 
 combined  to  produce  12  separate  tones.  These are NOT the same as touch 
 tones. See blue box tones for frequencies.
 
      mobile - A type of operator.
 
      NAP/PA - North American Pirate/Phreak Association. A large group of bbs
boards which include a lot of pirates/phreakers. I'm not quite sure where the
group will go from here.

      NON  PUB  DA  - A reverse type of CN/A bureau. You tell the service the 
 name  and the locality, they will supply the fone number. However, they will 
 ask  for  you  name,  supervisor's  name,  etc.  Use your social engineering 
 skills  here  (aka,  bullshitting skills). You also can get detailed billing 
 information from these bureaus.
 
      NPA  -  Numbering Plan Area. The area code of a certain city/state. For 
 example,  on  the  number  (111)222-3333,  the  NPA would be 111. Area codes 
 never  cross state boundaries sans the 800, 700, 900, and special exchanges. 
 
      Nxx  -  The exchange or prefix of the area to be dialed. For example of 
 the number (111)222-3333, the Nxx would be 222.
 
      OGVT - OutGoing Verification Trunk.
 
      OFF-HOOK  -  To  be  on-line,  to  have  the switchhook down. To have a 
 closed connection. At this point, you also have a local loop.
 
      ON-HOOK  -  To  be off-line, to have the switchhook up. To have an open 
 connection.
 
      ONI  -  Operator Number Identification. Identifies calling numbers when 
 an   office   is   not  equipped  with  CAMA,  the  calling  number  is  not 
 automatically recorded by CAMA, or has equipment failures, such as ANIF.
 
      OPCR  -  Operator  Actions  Program.  Standard  TBOC  or equivalent "0" 
 operator.
 
      OPEN  -  Northern  Telecom's  Open  Protocol  Enhanced  Networks  World 
 Program.
 
      OSI   -   Open   System   Interconnection.  Form  of  telecommunication 
 architechture which will probobly fail to SNA.
 
      OST - Originating Station Treatment.
 
      OTC - Operating Telefone Company.
 
      out-of-band  -  Type  of signaling which sends all of the signaling and 
 supervisory  informations,  such  as  ON  and  OFF  HOOK, over separate data 
 links.
 
      output  device  -  Any  type  of interface such as cans, terminal sets, 
 remote  switching centers, bridging heads, etc., where the fone lines of the 
 immediate  area are relayed to before going to the fone company. These often 
 are  those  cases  painted light green and stand up from the ground. Most of 
 these  can  be  opened  with a 7/16 hex driver, turning the security bolt(s) 
 1/8  of  an  inch  counter-clockwise,  and  opening. Terminals on the inside 
 might  be  labeled "T" for tip and "R" for ring. Otherwise, the ring side is 
 usually on the right and the tip side is on the left.
 
      OUTWATS  - Outward Wide Area Telecommunications Service. These are WATS 
 that are used to make outgoing calls ONLY. 
 
      Paper  Clip  Method  -  This method of phreaking was illustrated in the 
 movie  War Games. What a phortress fone does to make sure money is in a fone 
 is  send  an  electrical  pulse  to  notify  the  fone  that a coin has been 
 deposited,  for  the  first  coin  only.  However,  by  simply grounding the 
 positive  end  of  the microphone, enough current and voltage is deferred to 
 the  ground  to  simulate  the first quarter in the coin box. An easy way to 
 accomplish  this is to connect the center of the mouthpiece to the coin box, 
 touch  tone  pad,  or anything that looks like metal with a piece of wire. A 
 most  convenient  piece  of wire is a bend out of a paper clip. Then you can 
 send  red  box  tones  through the line and get free fone calls! Also, telco 
 modified  fones  may  require  you  to  push  the  clip  harder  against the 
 mouthpiece,  or  connect  the mouthpiece to the earpiece. If pressing harder 
 against the mouthpiece becomes a problem, pins may be an easier solution.
 
      PBX  -  Private Branch eXchange. A private switchboard used by some big 
 companies  that  allow  access  to  the  OUTWATS line by dialing  a 8 or a 9 
 after inputting a code.
 
      PCM - Pulse Code-Modulated trunks. 
 
      PC  Pursuit  -  A  computer  oriented LD system, comparable to Telenet, 
 which  offers low access rates to 2400 baud users. Hacking on this system is 
 virtually impossible due to the new password format.
 
      pen  register  -  A  device  that the fone company puts on your line if 
 they  suspect  you  are fraudulently using your fone. This will record EVERY 
 SINGLE  digit/rotary  pulse  you  enter  into  the  fone  as  well  as other 
 pertinent  information,  which  may  include a bit of tapping. Also known as 
 DNR.
 
      Phortune 500 - An elite  group  of  users  currently paving the way for
 better quality in their trade.

      PHRACK   -  Another  phreak/hack  oriented  newsletter.  See  reference 
 section, phile 1.6 for more information.
 
      PHUN  -  Phreakers and Hackers Underground Network. They also release a 
 newsletter  that  is up to #4 at the time of this writing. See phile 1.6 for 
 more information on finding this phile.
 
      PIN  -  Personal  Identification  Number  -  The  last four digits on a 
 calling card that adds to the security of calling cards.
 
      plant  tests  -  test  numbers  which include ANI, ringback, touch tone 
 tests, and other tests the telco uses.
 
      Post Office Engineers - The United Kingdom's fone workers.
 
      PP  -  Dial  Post-Pay  Service. On phortress fones, you are prompted to 
 pay  for the call after the called party answers. You can use a clear box to 
 get around this.
 
      PPS - Pulses Per Second.
 
      printmeter  -  The  United  Kingdom's equivalent of a pen register. See 
 pen register for more info.
 
      PTE - Packet Transport Equipment.
 
      PTL - One of the bigger cracking groups  of all time. However, the group
has been dying off and only has a few nodes as of this writing.

      PTS - Position and Trunk Scanner.
 
      PTT - Postal Telephone Telegraph.
 
      pulse - See rotary phones.
 
      purple  box  -  This one would be nice. Free calls to anywhere via blue 
 boxing,  become  an  operator  via  blue box, conference calling, disconnect 
 fone  line(s),  tap  fones,  detect  traces,  intercept directory assistance 
 calls. Has all red box tones. This one may not be available under ESS.
 
      rainbow  box  -  An  ultimate  box. You can become an operator. You get 
 free  calls,  blue  box. You can set up conference calls. You can forcefully 
 disconnect  lines.  You can tap lines. You can detect traces, change traces, 
 and  trace as well. All incoming calls are free. You can intercept directory 
 assistance.  You have a generator for all MF tones. You can mute and redial. 
 You  have  all  the  red-box tones. This is an awesome box. However, it does 
 not exist under ESS.
 
      RAO  -  Revenue  Accounting Office. The three digit code that sometimes 
 replaces the NPA of some calling cards.
 
      RBOC - Regional Bell Operating Company.
 
      red  box  -  Equipment that will emulate the red box tone generated for 
 coin recognition in all phortress fones.
 
      red  box  tones - Tones that tell the phortress fone how much money was 
 inserted  in  the  fone  to make the required call. In one slot fones, these 
 are  beeps in pulses; the pulse is a 2200+1700 Hz tone. For quarters, 5 beep 
 tones  at 12-17 PPS, for dimes it is 2 beep tones at 5-8.5 PPS, and a nickel 
 causes  1  beep  tone  at  5-8.5  PPS.  For  three slot fones, the tones are 
 different.  Instead of beeps, they are straight dual tones. For a nickel, it 
 is  one  bell  at 1050-1100 Hz, two bells for a dime, and one gong at 800 Hz 
 for  a  quarter.  When  using  red  box  tones, you must insert at least one 
 nickel  before playing the tones, cuz a ground test takes place to make sure 
 some  money  has  been  inserted. The ground test may be fooled by the Paper 
 Clip  Method.  Also,  it has been known that TSPS can detect certain red box 
 tones, and will record all data on AMA or CAMA of fraudulent activity.
 
      regional center - Any class 1 switching office in North America.
 
      REMOB  -  Method  of  tapping  into  lines by entering a code and the 7 
 digit  number you want to monitor, from ACD Test Mode. A possibility of this 
 may be mass conferencing.
 
      ring  -  The  red wire found in fone jacks and most fone equipment. The 
 ring  also is less positive than the tip. When looking at a fone plug on the 
 end  of typical 4 wire fone line from the top, let's say the top is the side 
 with  the  hook,  the ring will be the middle-right wire. Remember, the ring 
 is red, and to the right. The three "R's" revived!
 
      ring-around-the-rosy  -  9  connections  in tandem which would cause an 
 endless loop connection and has never occurred in fone history.
 
      ringback  -  A  testing  number that the fone company uses to have your 
 fone  ring  back  after  you  hang  up.  You  usually  input the three digit 
 ringback  number  and  then  the last four digits to the fone number you are 
 calling from.

      signalling  -  The  process  by  which  a  caller  or  equipment on the 
 transmitting  end of a line in: forms a particular party or equipment at the 
 receiving  end  that a message is to be communicated. Signalling is also the 
 supervisory  information  which  lets  the  caller  know the called know the 
 called  party  is  ready  to talk, the line is busy, or the called party has 
 hung up.
 
      silver  box  -  Equipment that will allow you to emulate the DTMF tones

 D=941+1633.  These  allow  special functions from regular fones, such as ACD 
 Testing Mode.
 
      Skyline  -  Service  owned  by  IBM,  Comsat, and AEtna. It has a local

 fortress  fones  that will prompt caller for money after the number, usually 
 LD  numbers,  has  been  dialed,  or the balance due before the call will be 
 allowed to connect.
 
      stacking  tandems  -  The  art  of  busying  out all trunks between two 
 points. This one is very amusing.

 machines and the new CCIS system.
 
      switchhook  -  The  button on your fone that, when depressed, hangs the 
 fone up. These can be used to emulate rotary dial fones if used correctly.
 
      SxS  -  Step-By-Step.  Also  known  as  the Strowger Switch or the two-
 motion  switch.  This  is  the switching equipment Bell began using in 1918. 
 However,  because  of  its  limitations,  such  as no direct use of DTMF and 
 maintenance  problems,  the  fone  company has been upgrading since. You can 
 identify  SxS  switching  offices  by  lack  of DTMF or pulsing digits after 
 dialing  DTMF, if you go near the CO it will sound like a typewriter testing 
 factory,  lack  of  speed  calling,  lack  of  special  services  like  call 
 forwarding  and  call  waiting,  and  fortress  fones want your money first, 
 before the dial tone.

/* Unix Fake Mail */

Most good Unix hackers should already know this, but to the up and coming,
we feel it important to include this simple, but powerful trick.

Telnet to port 25 of the receiving site by 'telnet host.com 25'

Once connected, it may or may not require you to type 'helo' [sic]
If it doesn't don't.

type 'mail from: ' and then your imaginary sender:
ex.  'mail from: satan@hell.org' or 'mail from: root@white.house.gob', or some
sort, depending of course on your purpose.

after you get a sender OK, specify the user to receive the mail:
type 'rcpt to: ' and then the appropriate username.

next, type 'data' and hit enter.  This will start entering the data field of
your letter.  Enter as follows:

From: satan@hell.org (Lord of the Underworld)
To: schmuck@anywhere.edu
Subject: Your sinning
Status: R

Your terrible sinning has sparked my interests, we are currently accepting 
applications for head daemon, 5th level of hell. Please include a photo.

Thanks...

The '.' on a line by itself ends the input.  Note, that the From, To, Subject,
and Status lines should be included for the mail headers to make sense of it.
Of course there is the obvious message of:

From: root

/* Walgreen's Store Pricing Code */

Ever curious how much stores mark up their goods on you?  Well it is quite easy
to tell at Walgreen's.  On each price tag, you will see a group of letters, in
this example say, "ARB".  These letters are the key to the stores purchase
price.  The letters correspond to the positions in the code "BRUSH CLEAN".
Here is how it works:   BRUSH CLEAN
                        12345 67890
Simply replace the letters with their appropriate digit, in our example (ARB) 
it would be 9-2-1, in other words, $9.21  Now if they want you to pay $60.00

Teenage Hacker Emulates Hess
---------------------------- 
[Summary from Computer Weekly, 8th August 1991.]

A 16 year old schoolboy named Jamie Moulding has been cautioned by plainclothed
police after hacking into a military computer and trying to sell secrets to the
USSR.  He claims to have read the Ministry of Defense personnel and payroll
files.  One computer he entered held details of a British Army tank control
system.  Moulding first incorporated details of the system into his own 
simulation package, and then phoned the Soviet Union's London embassy to try to
sell the information.  Next day two policemen turned up at his home and spoke 
to his parents.  Moulding's telephone bills were unwittingly paid by his 
school.  He wrote an autodialer program and an automatic hack program which 
"planted a command which led to a display of passwords".  DEC denied that its
systems had been hacked. The police officers were unavailable for comment. 



Phone Card Scam Cheats Beaumont Residents
-----------------------------------------
[Houston Chronicle, Sept. 28, 1991]

     Several residents have been cheated out of hundreds of dollars by con
artists who call, posing as police or phone company employees, and ask for the
residents' telephone credit card numbers.  Most of the victims are elderly and
are eager to cooperate, since they are promised that they will be reimbursed 
for any long-distance calls.
     About eight Beaumont residents received extremely high phone bills last
month, including one that totaled $1,395, after giving their calling card
numbers to the California based con artists, Southwestern Bell spokesman Frank
Merriman said.  Merriman said the caller identifies himself as a law 
enforcement officer or a telephone company employee who needs the resident's
calling card number to catch a credit card theif or an employee suspected of 
misconduct.
     A Beaumont physician, who was not identified, told authorities he gave his
number to a man who posed as an FBI agent.  The physician later received
long-distance bills totaling $1,395 that included calls to Iran, Puerto Rico,
Hong Kong, Belgium, and China.
     The doctor said the man who called him said they had arrested a man in
Atlanta who had 19 cards, including his.  "He said he has to really arrest this
guy, because he's ripping off the public, and that he needs my help." the 
doctor said.
     The calls have been traced to a pay phone in Los Angeles, he said.
Customers should never give their calling card numbers to anyone over the
phone, Merriman said.  Southwestern Bell will adjust the charges if the company
can prove the customer did not make the calls, he said, but such scams end up
costing customers.  "It's like shoplifting," he said.  "It's a cost, and 
sombody has to incur it."



Security Comes To The Free Software Foundation
----------------------------------------------
[Summary from an article in the Boston Globe, Aug 6, 1991.]

     The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has been forced to institute security
(password) control because "vandals who were able to enter the foundation's
system anonymously were not only deleting and trashing files there, but were
also entering Internet ... and doing damage in other systems as well."...  
Michael Bushnell, a programmer at the Free Software Foundation, said the 
changes are making systems more inconvenient to use and creating an
international network that cannot be used without an operator putting himself 
under surveillance.
     "There's not a big sharp impact because, over time, so many networks 
already created security barriers," Bushnell said.  Extension of these 
restrictions..." is kind of like when the last critical-of-the-government 
newspaper is shut down.  After it's gone a while, people notice a difference.
An estimated 1,000 to 2,00 persons gained access ... and staff members say they
will try to preserve this somehow."  "I feel ashamed not having an open 
system," says [Richard] Stallman, "I feel ashamed having a system that treats 
everyone as vandals when in fact very few were... Every time I think about this
I want to cry."



Miser Held in Record Social Security Fraud
------------------------------------------ 
[Extracted from the article in from the ClariNet news service.]

     Robert L. Chesney is facing trial in the single biggest Social Security
fraud case in U.S. history.  He is accused of receiving retirement and
disability checks under at least 29 names.  Federal agents found 15 boxes and
three steamer trunks full of birth certificates, bank statements, Social
Security cards and over 200 CA DMV id cards, each with Chesney's picture and a
different name.  Chesney allegedly gleaned biographical date about public
personalities from the library.  Pretending to be those people, Chesney would
write to their home counties, give their birth dates and other information and
ask for copies of their birth certificates.  He then took the documents to the
DMV and obtained the ID cards with which he applied for the Social Security
benefits.



SWBT's Responds to the Supreme Court's White Pages Ruling 
---------------------------------------------------------
[By SWBT Media Relations staff]
 
      The following article discusses Southwestern Bell's response to the 
recent Supreme Court ruling that White Pages Directory Listings generally are
not protected by Federal copyright law.  

Media Relations Report
----------------------
Subject: White Pages Listings Generally Not Protected By Copyright Law, Supreme
         Court Rules
Contact: George Stenitzer 

      White pages directory listings generally are not protected by federal
copyright law, the Supreme Court ruled today.  The court said that white pages
listings are facts that lack the originality required to have copyright
protection, although directories as compilations may be copyrighted.
      The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Feist Publications Inc. versus
Rural Telephone Service Co.  Feist publishes wide area directories in parts of
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  When Rural, a small Kansas telephone cooperative
refused to license its white pages directory to Feist, Feist extracted listings
from Rural's directory without permission.  The Supreme Court held that Rural's
listings were not entitled to copyright protection, and that Feist did not
violate copyright laws by using the listings.  This ruling reversed earlier
decisions by the District Court and Court of Appeals, and expressly rejected
earlier cases holding that directory listings could be copyrighted.
      Today's ruling means that other firms may use published white pages
listings without violating copyright laws.  Southwestern Bell Telephone has
licensed the use of its white pages listings to directory publishers in both
paper and magnetic formats.  SWBT's policy is not to license listings to direct
marketing firms but today's ruling suggests that direct marketing companies may
use published listings without a license.  Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages does
not license its yellow pages listings.
      SWBT's licensing of published white pages listings in a paper format
represents about $250,000 in annual revenues; these revenues may be affected by
the ruling.  However, today's ruling does not give other firms free access to
SWBT's yet-to-be-published listings, to listings in magnetic form, or to the
white pages database itself.
      If queried, Southwestern Bell will respond as follows:

"Of course, we don't think it's fair that other firms can copy our published
listings without paying for them."

"Most of our white pages listing customers, however, are seeking updated
listings in magnetic tape form, not the right to copy listings from directories
that have already been published.  Our white pages databases are updated
continuously, and the Supreme Court did not deal with the unpublished data
contained in telephone company databases"

Queries will be handled by SWBT's Sherry Smith.



Returns for Senders: (US Postal Service handling of forwardings)
----------------------------------------------------------------
[From the July/August issue of the Common Cause Magazine]

     The U.S. Postal Service - the butt of so many complaints about inefficient
service -- is on its toes in one way the average mail recipient might not
appreciate.  The same system that enables the Postal Service to forward your
mail to a new address also alerts scads of direct marketers -- from the folks
at your favorite mail-order company to those pesky tricksters who say they have
a special gift waiting if only you'll call to your new whereabouts.  The system
seems to work for better and for worse.  For better: You get the mail you want
and the Postal Service saves time and money by not delivering mail to the wrong
address.  For worse: Junk mailers you never wanted to hear from discover your
new address and waste no time making use of it.
     Postal officials insist that they share change-of-address information only
with those who already have your old address.  Thanks to the large-scale 
selling and renting of customer lists among direct mail marketers, some 
companies that never knew you existed will have your particulars.  The Postal
Service forwards about 2.3 billion pieces of mail a year for the 40 million 
Americans who move annually, at a cost of some $1 billion, says Bob Krause,
director of the Postal Service's National Change of Address (NCOA) system.
     Meanwhile 19 companies, including some of the largest direct-marketing
list management firms, pay the Postal Service an annual fee of roughly $48,000
to receive computerized NCOA updates every two weeks.  These "licensees" then 
provide the updated information to their customers, who pay for address changes
for consumers already on their mailing lists.
     The Post Office places great importance on keeping address-correction 
information secure, Krause says, and the licensees must follow strict 
guidelines on what they can do with it.  They may not use the information to
develop mailing lists.  But direct marketers who properly obtain the 
information from the Post Office or its licensees can make it available to 
others with impunity.  Ann Zeller, vice president for information and special
projects of the Direct Marketing Association, concedes that firms can buy
names from a direct mailer who has a consumer's new address.
     Evan Hendricks, editor of the Washington-based Privacy Times newsletter,
is "very suspicious" of the system.  Without realizing it, individuals who 
complete change-of-address cards are permanently giving away their addresses to
anyone who asks for them," he says, and that should be clearly explained on the
card.
     Of course a change-of-address card is only one of many methods direct
mailers have for learning a person's new address.  Those who would sell you
their wares also mine motor vehicle records, voter rolls, magazine subscription
bases, home purchase records and other sources.
     There is a way out.  Individuals who want their names removed from various
mailing lists can contact the New York-based Direct Marketing Association, 
which runs a name and address "suppression" service.  But, Krause notes, "If 
you buy something at your new address from any direct marketer, your name will
be on a number of lists within weeks."



Inmate, working for TWA, steals credit card numbers
---------------------------------------------------
[From September 8, 1991 `Los Angeles Times']

     Carl Simmons, a 20-year-old California Youth Authority inmate, working as
a TWA telephone reservation agent, stole dozens of customer credit card numbers
and used them for thousands of dollars of personal charges.  He is now serving
two years in state prison for the thefts.
     TWA has used CYA inmates in a special program since 1986.  The story says
the program "has been touted as a way to help young criminals learn a trade and
repay their debt to society.  It has raised more than $500,000 for victims' 
restitution and the cost of incarceration.  And the program's 213 graduates,
many of whom now work at airlines and travel agencies, are one-tenth as likely
to commit new crimes as nongraduates, CYA officials said."
     CYA has tightened security, including more frequent searching of rooms and
occasional strip-searches.  Inmates have always been forbidden from taking pen
and paper into the computer room, and now not even instruction manuals can be 
taken out.  But Simmons and another inmate said that won't stop inmates from 
stealing card numbers or illegally charging airline tickets.
     Fred Mills of the CYA says, "There's always going to be an exception, but
99.9 times out of a hundred in a program you're not going to get that.  For 
every person we can keep out of the institution for a year, that's saving the
state about $31,000.  That's the thing we have to look at and balance."
     One victim, New Hampshire businessman Phillip Parker, said, "I don't want
to begrudge someone a chance to make it back into a productive life, but giving
them a chance where there's a significant amount of potential for financial 
fraud or risk -- maybe there's other things that would make more sense."
     TWA says it will now re-evaluate the program.



Network Security Lacking at Major Stock Exchanges
------------------------------------------------- 
[From Network World, Sep. 16, 1991]

     "The General Accounting Office (GAO) found a total of 68 computer and
network security and control problems at five of the nation's six major 
exchanges during reviews it conducted this past year for the Securities and
Exchange Commissions.  The lack of adequate controls at the five stock markets
could impair their ability to maintain continuous service, protect critical
computer equipment and operations, and process correct information."  The worst
three in terms of numbers of problems were the Midwest (24), Pacific (18), and 
Philadelphia (18) exchanges, which were all faulted for their inadequate risk 
analysis.  The biggest problems were in the areas of contingency planning and 
disaster recovery.  The NY and American stock exchanges came off relatively 
well.  



Computer Security Breach at Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant
------------------------------------------------------------- 
[Associated Press, 9/16/91]

     Security lapses at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant included the
storage of top-secret bomb designs for a week on a VAX accessible from the
public phone network. In other instances, workers transferred classified 
working materials from secure computers to lower security ones, including PCs,
because they were tired of constant changes in the secure systems and wanted to
work on familiar systems.
     Head of DOE operations at Rocky Flats Bob Nelson said that the agency 
started last year a $37M program to correct security problems, following the
recommendations of outside security experts.
     Nelson also said that the unclassified VAX was used by employees working
from home, but that if someone tries to break in "bells and whistles go off"  
According to other documents obtained by the AP, other DOE computers had been 
found to be vulnerable to break-ins.



Virus Halted Government Computers in South China
 ------------------------------------------------

     HONG KONG, Sept 16 (AFP) - A spate of computer virus attacks put computers
in more than 90 Chinese governmental departments out of order, prompting the
authorities to have all software checked by police, a official Chinese news
agency reported here Monday.  More than 20 kinds of the rogue disruptive 
programs hit more than 75 percent of the offices' computers in southern China's
Guangdong province, the Hong Kong China News Service said.  The provincial 
public security bureau had ordered all government units not to use software 
from unknown origin or software which had not been inspected by the bureau.  In
addition, units or individuals were banned from engaging in the study of
computer viruses, or to hold training courses on them.  The new regulations 
forbid the sale of software capable of neutralizing the viruses.  The report
said the public security bureau had set up a testing department for all 
software against the computer viruses.



AT&T Phone Failure Downs Three New York Airports For Four Hours
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
[N.Y. Times, Sep 18, 1991.]

     Operations at all three New York airports ground to a standstill from 5pm
until 9pm yesterday [Sep 17, 1991] when an AT&T internal power failure at a
Manhattan 4-ESS switching center knocked out long distance calls in and out of
the city. Neighboring commercial power was unaffected.  The 4-ESS system is 
used to route calls between AT&T's long-distance network and the local 
companies.  The air traffic control centers use a network of radio towers 
linked by phone lines.
     Although the precise origin of Tuesday's problems remained unclear, the
extent of the difficulties provided yet another example of how dependent 
today's telephone networks are on a few pieces of equipment.  In recent years,
AT&T and other companies have gone to great lengths to emphasize the back-up 
capacity and redundancy of their systems.  Yet the long-distance carrier was
unable to reroute all traffic to other gateways for several hours after the 
problems first became apparent.  Calls were redirected to the two remaining
gateways, but those could not handle that much increased traffic.  



Midwest Stock Exchange Reaps Millions Due to Accounting Glitch
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
[Summary from Chicago Tribune Business Section, 9-20-91]

     The Chicago Tribune reports that leaders of the Midwest Stock Exchange had
discovered a 13-year-old accounting glitch which enabled a subsidiary to 
wrongfully reap millions of dollars in interest payments which should have gone
to broker-dealers.  While the exact amount of money received by the subsidiary
due to the error was not disclosed, the chairman of the exchange said that he
estimated that over the last twelve months, the firm received around 1.8
million dollars.
     The accounting error, due partly to human error and partly the fault of 
computers, apparently dates back to about 1978. At that time, the exchange and
two of its subsidiaries, Midwest Clearing Corp. and Midwest Securities Trust
Co., altered the way certain broker-dealer transactions were handled.  Clearing
Corp. instituted a change, largely computerized, ordering broker-dealers to
wire money to it for the sale of securities before the securities were received
by Securities Trust Company.
     By depositing these funds in short-term, government-backed securities, 
sometimes overnight but also for longer periods, Clearing Corp. generated for
itself interest payments which should have gone to the broker-dealers. This is
referred to as "playing the float."  When the clearing system is working 
properly, the securities and proceeds are transmitted through the system
simultaneously, thus eliminating such a float.
     The Midwest Stock Exchange insists that they are taking the situation very
seriously, and plan to pay the money back. Some exchange members are concerned
that the money used for the refund will come in the form of higher exchange 
rates, putting the exchange at a serious competitive disadvantage.



SWBT sends off first 'cross-country' ISDN call
----------------------------------------------
[This Week, by Southwestern Bell Telephone]

     The nation's first "cross-country" public network ISDN was placed last
week, courtesy of SWBT.  The historic first call was the result of a two-year
joint effort among SWBT, BellSouth Corp., US Sprint and Bellcore.  SWBT's 
Advanced Technology Lab originated the call, which used US Sprint's digital
facilities in Burlingame, Calif.  The call terminated at a BellSouth switch in
Atlanta, Ga.
     Using an ISDN video application, SWBT's trial director Ken Goodgold
was able to see and talk to BellSouth's David Collins.  "With this test,
the geographic limits of ISDN-based services were stretched from a few
miles to cross-country," Goodgold says.  "We began with protocol testing
and service verification, two key parts of the process,"  Goodgold says.
"That required an extremely complex series of technical tests.  The
Advanced Technology Lab staff worked for months performing the tests
leading up to the first successful call."
     Last week's test call was significant from a marketing perspective as
well as a technical one.  That's because it demonstrated the economic
benifits of using ISDN for video information.  "The cost of a long distance
call is approximately the same, whether it's a voice transmission using a
regular phone line or a video transmission using ISDN," Goodgold says.
"That means a big reduction in cost to arrange a videoconference."
     US Sprint joined the test because ISDN has evolved beyond the local
stage, says Terry Kero, the carrier's director of InfoCom Systems
Development Labs.  "After today, it will be technically possible to make an
ISDN call across the country just as it is possible today to make a regular
long distance call," Kero says.



Computer Hacker Cited 
---------------------
[Houston Chronicle Sept. 25, 1991]

WASHINGTON--A Colorado computer hacker has been charged with breaking into
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's computer system seven times
last year, the Justice Department said.
     Richard Wittman, 24, of Aurora, Colo., allegedly "altered, damaged and
destroyed information" in the space agency's computer system twice, the
department said.
     He was charged with illegally gaining access to the NASA computer system
and to its computers at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
and the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  If convicted on all
charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $1 million 
fine.
