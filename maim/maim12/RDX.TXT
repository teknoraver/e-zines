                                R.D.X.
                              (Cyclonite)

Lamer's Disclaimer. I'm sick of god damned disclaimers. If you blow yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  up I don't really care. The concentrated nitric acid in
this will happily melt your face into something resembling the Elephant Man.
So don't come crying to me because I will laugh and most likely urinate on you!

Introduction: Okay, who wants to make an explosive more destructive than
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 'bulb bombs' and more potential for grievous bodily harm 
than black powder? Well if you're ready for some hard work then this is 
the file for you. The work isn't really hard, but it's a real cunt to do 
coz if you don't put in the correct measurements, it could destroy your 
working area and more importantly, you. Okay, this won't be easy to explain 
I'll do my best. Some of the stuff in here you'll have to flog from school, 
but if your chem' teacher is as dumb as mine was, it won't be hard. All you 
gotta say is that you got a chemistry set at home and you've run out of 
whatever. NOTE- RDX is a substance which is 150% more powerful then TNT!

Things You'll Need: The ingredients in R.D.X. are not easy to get and I'm 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  not sure that half of the stores exist any more. But here
                    they are anyway.

Materials:                          Where to buy/steal it:
~~~~~~~~~~~                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Firelighters (50g)   This are those white blocks. Get the HEXAMINE ones.
			  These are easily bought from disposal stores.     
     Concentrated 
     nitric acid (550 ml) I once bought this from a photography store in
                          Frankston. It wasn't cheap. I dunno if the store
                          is still open. Buy two bottles if possible.
     Distilled water      You can pick this up from K-mart pretty cheap.
     Table salt           Duh! Your own pantry.
     Ice                  Gee...I wonder where???
     Ammonium nitrate     Your mum will probably have this stuff in the 
                          laundry. You'll know it coz it stinks FUCKIN' BAD!
                          Also can be bought from Coles. You can get this shit
			  from grain stores, etc. (it's a fertilizer).

Other Stuff:                        Where to buy/steal it:
~~~~~~~~~~~                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Glass beaker.      The biggest you can steal from school.(Over 500ml)
   Glass stirring rod. You could also flog this from your school lab.
   Funnel.            Same as above. 
   Filter paper.      You should be able to get this at a chemist.
   Plastic container. This has to be bigger than the beaker coz it's the 
                      ice bath holder.
   Thermometer.       It's gotta be Centigrade and not the other lame type.
   Blue Litmus Paper. Buy it from the chemist. Say it's for a chemistry
                      assignment. If he asks for a note or ID go to 
                      another place to piss him off.(Go to chemists with
		      asians running them, as they will usually sell anything
		      to anyone).

Notes: REMEMBER, all these insurrections are precise, so if you fuck something
~~~~~  up, you'll probably have to buy more ingredients and that sux for a 
cheap-o like me. And the acid you buy will probably be a diluted solution,
so you'll have to get a glass pot or something (I used a can, but some guy
said that the acid could absorb some aluminium off the can, I doubt it did
coz it worked fine. Be your own judge.) that you can boil it in. WARNING:
boil your acid outside coz when it's ready, it gives off white smoky fumes.
DON'T INHALE THEM! The fumes really fucked me up. Once the acid is 
concentrated, pour it in a suitable container and store it in the fridge.

Step One: Set out all of your stuff. Make sure it's all safe and sealed if
~~~~~~~~  necessary. You need a quiet place for about a whole day (if you
take your time: advisable).

Step Two: Make an ice bath. To do this put some water in your plastic 
~~~~~~~~  container and chuck it in the deep freeze for about 2 hours. 
Then put in lotsa ice in it.

Step Three: Place the beaker in the ice bath and carefully pour in 550 ml of
~~~~~~~~~~  the concentrated nitric acid into it (the beaker).

Step Four: Stick the thermometer in the acid and wait 'till it's dropped to 
~~~~~~~~~  about 17 or 18 degrees. Once there, add small bits of the fire-
lighters. This will cause them to dissolve and emit heat, keep the mix well
below 30 degrees Centigrade. If it gets over 30C then something pretty bad
will happen (or so my friend says). After all you've added 50g of the 
hexamine firelighters, stir it. Wipe away the sweat and proceed to the next
step.

Step Five: Drop the mix temperature down below zero by adding the salt and 
~~~~~~~~~  ammonium nitrate to the ice bath and stirring it. Before that,
drain out the old water and add some newly chilled stuff. Okay, when the
mix is below zero, stir it for about twenty minutes, all the time under 0C.

Step Six: (This bit sux) Poor out your mixture onto about a litre of crushed
~~~~~~~~  ice in a clean beaker. Shake and stir until all the ice has melted.
Use your funnel and filter paper to extract the little build up off crystals.
The remaining fluid is corrosive, so throw it on your neighbours car to 
relieve some stress.

Step Seven: Boil up a half litre of the distilled water and tip the crystals
~~~~~~~~~~  in there. Filter them out and test with blue litmus paper like on
that soap ad. It will probably not stay blue, therefor, you'll have to do
steps six and seven a few times until the litmus paper stays blue. This makes
the crystals a heap more stable and safe.

Step Eight: Store the crystals wet until ready for use. Allow them to dry 
~~~~~~~~~~  completely way before using them, NOT in the oven!. R.D.X. 
is not stable enough to use alone as an explosive so here's how to do it.

Stuff you'll need:                Where to buy/steal it:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mineral Oil.                      I think McEwens stock it.
Lecithin.                         This is a vitamin, so a chemist will do.

(***These measurements are precise, try your best to get them right.***)
Step Seven: Composition C-1 can be made by mixing 88.3% R.D.X. (by WEIGHT) 
~~~~~~~~~~  with 0.6% lecithin and 11.1%  mineral oil. Kneed these material
together in a plastic zip-lock bag. This is a good way to desensitise the 
explosive and get more for your hard stolen dollar.

Concluding Notes: And there you have it. Believe me, this might be a lot 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~of fucking around just for some fun, but once you see what 
this does to a toilet block or tree, you'll understand. I live near enough 
to a nature reserve and it is the perfect target for this stuff. If your a real
psycho, you could do some really serious damage to someone house but I don't
advise it. Ever since that asshole in S.A. wasted the cop building, they've
been cracking down. So if you buy from a chemical supply house, shop around
coz they know all he ingredients of this sorta stuff.
    There is something you can do to R.D.X. with ammonium nitrate to make it
more powerful, but I haven't seen it anywhere yet, if YOU know, mail me
