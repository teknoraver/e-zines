 
Panther Modernz Phile #3 
------- ------- ----- -- 
Discovered and Typed by Sir Hairy Legg 
(Aka Hairy Leech) of Panther Modernz. 
 
Note: Fomatted once again with 40 
columns for your lame printer. 
 
Another Note: Just for the hell of it 
I'd like to say that the law of this 
great land forbids using this info in 
any way.. I do not promote it's use 
(yeh, right!) so you get nailed, it's 
your fault. 
 
Okay.. now to the meat: 
 
If you know this or not, all those 
50316xxxxx codes are related. I mean, 
a code from one dial-up is compatiable 
with only minor modifications with any 
other dial-up. 
 
I hear that all those pbx systems are 
owned by some company in California, 
and obviously they are stupid wanker 
fucks. 
 
These are all the dial-ups (live and 
dead) I know of for the 503 codes: 
 
1-800-535-4501 
1-800-553-7149 
1-800-225-5946 
1-800-233-7684 
1-800-633-4102 
1-800-292-3044 
1-800-535-6246 
 
I am sure there are more, but I don't 
remember them right off hand. 
 
These things were first hacked on about 
7 months ago (current date is 10/21/90) 
and they are just now getting really 
popular. 
 
Anyway. This is how it's done: 
 
I classify 503 codes like this: 
 
5031677171 
---===:::: 
 
--- denotes prefix 
=== denotes 'base' 
:::: denotes code 
 
First thing to do is get a code from 
one 503 pbx system. Let's use the code 
above, (working, with the 2255946 
dial-up, I might add.) for our example. 
 
5031677171 -> 1-800-225-5946 
 
To convert this code for use on another 
system, you need only change 1 digit. 
That would happen to be the 3rd from 
last digit, the 1. 
 
So, to convert, change this: 
 
5031677x71 
 
Now, you find yourself another 503 
supporting system, let's use 
1-800-535-4501 for this example. 
 
So, to convert your code, you need only 
call the 1-800-535-4501 number, and 
try your code with various digits as 
the 'x'. 
 
Like this. Call the 1-800-535-4501 and 
try these codes: 
 
5031677071 
5031677171 
5031677271 
5031677371 
5031677471 
5031677571 
5031677671 
5031677771 
5031677871 
5031677971 
 
You need only make 10 calls. Or, on 
some 503 systems where you get 2 trys, 
5 calls. 
 
Note how the 3rd from last digit changesin the list. 
 
So. Broken into steps, it looks like 
this: 
 
#1 - Locate a 503 code dial-up. 
#2 - Locate a code (dead or live) from 
     any 503 dial-up. 
#3 - Alter the 3rd from last digit of 
     your code. 
#4 - Call your dial-up, and try all 10 
     of the variations of the code. 
 
That about wraps that. 
 
Of course, some dail-ups work slightly 
differantly. For instance, some ask you 
for code, then number. Some ask for 
number, then code. Some just make a 
lame tone at you. 
 
There is just one other snag. 
 
If you will remember, === denoted 
base. I have found that not all dialups 
support all the bases. 
 
Example: Known bases for the 225-5946 
dial up are as follows: 
 
167 
168 
162 
161 
163 
166 
177 
 
Bases for 535-4501 on the other hand, 
are these: 
 
106 
158 
185 
 
So. You see now that a code from a 4501 
cannot be converted to a 5946. 
 
But, I hear talk that to hack (i.e. witha hacker program) these things, you 
set your hacker with a template such as 
this: 
 
5031xxxxxx 
 
So.. All dialups may be compatiable. 
 
I dont really know at this time. I 
really dont care for these codes anyway,so I dont care either way. 
 
You figure it out. After all, you are 
hacks and phreaks too. 
 
Enjoy.. Proven to work by me, I 
calculated 29 working codes on the 225 
system from dead ones on some other 
system. 
 
The end. 
 
Special thanks to Ghost, for helping 
me to compile a list of bases/dialups. 
 
(Told you I'd put that in..)
