 
Hiya.Alot has been asked about EasyNet...some folks thought it was a new system 
that could be used to access outdials,much like SprintNet's PC Pursuit service. 
However,yours truly went thru the trouble of actually getting an account on 
EasyNet (a Telebase System),and here is a buffered account of what I found. 
 
EasyNet is in fact,a database network,on which you can scan a variety of text 
files updated at a variety of intervals,from daily to weekly to whenever. 
I have no idea what others have done on this system,but for those who are 
interested,it can be accessed via SprintNet(Telenet) at 21549;CompuNet at 
HostName:Telebase;and via TymNet at Terminal ID: 'A' and Login:EasyNet.

LANS REACH OUT AT COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS '90 -- PART I OF II 
 
Caryn Fox and Beth Bacheldor 
 
Although Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) was a popular 
subject at last month's Communications Networks '90 trade show 
in Washington, D.C., the real show-stealers were LAN-to-WAN and 
LAN-to-LAN integration and interconnection. 
 
Show attendees were overwhelmingly interested in LANs and LAN 
interconnection strategies.  Seminar sessions -- even in the early 
morning -- were standing-room-only. 
 
At one session, Mary Modahl, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. 
(Cambridge, Mass.), predicted that smart wiring hubs will be an 
important growth market in the LAN arena. 
 
Modahl said the hubs -- which provide physical layer network 
management, support multiple media, and provide bridging/routing 
capabilities -- will serve as the central point of LAN 
interconnection. 
 
Although they are available from only a few companies -- such 
as SynOptics Communications Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), 
Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa Clara, Calif.), Cabletron Inc. (East 
Rochester, N.H.), Proteon Inc. (Westborough, Mass.), and Chipcom 
Corp. (Waltham, Mass.) -- smart wiring hubs will attract large 
users because of their low cost and solid migration path to Fiber 
Distributed Data Interface, Modahl said. 
 
Smart hubs save users money by supporting a variety of media, 
including the upcoming 100 Mbps FDDI standard, Modahl noted. 
 
The interconnection theme also came across on the show floor, 
where a number of vendors launched new products and partnerships 
for linking disparate networks. 
 
* US Sprint (Reston, Va.) unveiled the LAN Reach product family, 
which links LANs via Sprint's SprintNet (formerly Telenet) 
nationwide public data network.  Sprint said it plans to develop 
an array of LAN connectivity products based on several different 
technologies and standards. 
 
LAN Reach provides X.25 connectivity and supports the Open Systems 
Interconnect (OSI) X.400 protocol for electronic mail, Sprint 
said.  The X.400 interface allows LAN users to access the 
SprintMail E-mail messaging service, which is interconnected with 
many other domestic and international e-mail services. 
 
Sprint also signed an agreement to resell Eicon Technology Corp.'s 
(Montreal, Canada) X.25/LAN gateway and bridge products.  Sprint 
said it is developing an integrated network management system to 
control the SprintNet-Eicon gateway interconnection. 
 
* Under an agreement with CrossComm Corp. (Marlborough, Mass.), 
General DataComm Industries Inc. (Middlebury, Conn.) will add a 
family of LAN bridges to its current T1 WAN product line. 
 
* BBN Communications Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.), traditionally a WAN 
vendor, said it will offer LAN interconnection products and 
services as part of its "total network offering." 
 
* NCR Comten (St. Paul, Minn.), an IBM-oriented networking vendor, 
announced a new Network Integration Service for users to integrate 
their LANs and WANs. 
 
All in all, the conference showed that the lines between local 
and wide area networking are fading fast.  Next on the agenda? 
High-speed LAN/WAN interconnectivity. 
 
Many major vendors touted FDDI-compliant products at the show. 
On the WAN side, Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) -- an 
upcoming industry standard for high-speed fiber optic wide 
area networking -- may be loosely viewed as FDDI's WAN equivalent. 
As WANS and LANs integrate with each other, keep an eye out for 
FDDI-to-SONET products. 
 
LAN STANDARDS COME OF AGE 
 
FDDI 
 
After much debate the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is 
finally close to completion.  According to Floyd Ross, chairman of 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Station 
Management (SMT) working group, the SMT document of the emerging 
standard should be ready for approval within a few months. 
 
Ross predicted that by April, the SMT committee will have a 
document that will essentially be the SMT standard.  "There are 
only details to work out" in the next few months, he said. 
However, because of the red tape still ahead, Ross said the 
standard will not be officially completed until early 1991. 
 
The SMT document of the 100 megabit per second, FDDI LAN 
specification has been a major stumbling block in completing the 
standard.  Of the four documents -- Physical (PHY), Physical Media 
Dependent (PMD), Media Access Control (MAC), and SMT -- the SMT 
had been the center of hot debate at ANSI (see NETLINE, November 
'89, p. 2). 
 
According to Ross, the station manager is the focal point of 
network interoperability.  "The station manager acts as the 
interface between management entities, monitors station activity, 
monitors station configuration and capabilities, and reconfigures 
the stations if there is a failure on the network," he explained. 
 
The debate was between vendors who wanted to define high-level 
management specifications (mostly high-end vendors) and those 
who wanted to keep the management capabilities basic (mostly 
low-end vendors).  The argument from the low-end vendors was that 
including the high-level functionality specifications would stall 
the standard's passage. 
 
The final decision was to include the higher-level capabilities. 
The low-end vendors "realized it would be quicker to put [the 
higher-level procedures] in than to try and keep them out," Ross 
said. 
 
So, what does all this mean to the user?  Right now, not much. 
The passage of the FDDI standard, in fact, may bring on a classic 
case of post-hype letdown.  The approval will not create an 
"instant market" for products, because the fiber medium still 
faces several important implementation stumbling blocks. 
 
Over time, a more stable standard may help the FDDI market.  This 
year, users will see FDDI offerings from vendors that are not 
"FDDI shops," such as Digital Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.) and 
Unisys Corp. (Blue Bell, Pa.).	This support from large vendors 
will further open the FDDI market and give users a broader vendor 
choice. 
 
Although stable standards may spur some companies to begin 
offering FDDI solutions, these companies will probably be more 
influenced by DEC and Unisys than by ANSI.  In a sense, then, the 
FDDI boom will coincide with -- not result from -- the passage of 
the standard. 
 
With the standards in place, FDDI must now face two critical 
obstacles to its implementation:  price and interoperability. 
 
Price is, perhaps, the more important issue, as users must first 
be able to afford the FDDI network before dealing with 
interoperability problems.  And the only thing that will drive 
FDDI prices down is demand. 
 
A "Catch-22," you say?  Yes, but not forever.  As networking 
advances, there will be more customers who "must have" FDDI.  And, 
as more of these users move toward an FDDI backbone, vendors will 
price their products more competitively.  However, such price wars 
may be several years in coming. 
 
nteroperability may not be as far away.  As networking moves 
toward multivendor interoperability and interconnectivity, vendors 
are moving toward interoperability.  In addition, industry groups 
such as the SMT Development Forum will set up testing laboratories 
where vendors can test their wares along with those of their 
competitors. 
 
The approval of the FDDI standard will affect neither price nor 
interoperability.  So, bottom line:  Don't expect fireworks when 
the standard is passed.  All the standard really means is that you 
won't have to change floppies any more to implement the latest 
version of the SMT document.  However, keep an eye on your primary 
vendors -- chances are they're planning to pull FDDI rabbits out 
of their hats in the very near future.
