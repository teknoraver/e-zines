 
Yup,you guessed it,this is yet another of what we hope will 
be a long series of Modernz files,covering everything and anything 
we feel would be worth sharing. 
 
This file is going to concern itself with Outdials...you know,those 
knifty little gems found from time to time on the networks and some 
systems.I do not claim by any means to be the god of GOD's...but I am 
a firm believer in spreading information around. 
 
So you ask..what is an outdial? It is a system set up by some company 
to allow their computers/personel to dial out via some # or network 
address without having to shell out quarters to ma bell every 3 minutes. 
I'm most familiar with outdials that can be reached via the two main 
nets,namely Telenet & Tymnet.I am best familiar with three main types, 
so will limit this phile to discussing them. 
 
Blah.Anyway...among the cheeziest of the systems going are run off of 
Datapac in Canada...reached on Tymnet via the prefix 3020.The system 
looks pretty much like this: 
 
************************************************************************** 
(You log onto tymnet...tell it who you are,then hit) 
 
;3020xxxxxxxx 
 
Enter Destination Telephone Number (e.g. 5555555) / 
Entrer le numero de telephone du destinataire (ex. 5555555) 
12017485030 (Tell it where ya wanna call) 
 
Dialing / Composition du numero 
12017485030 
Ringing / Sonnerie 
 
Communication Established 
************************************************************************** 
 
And thats about it.I don't much care for these systems because 9 times 
out of 10,they don't function properly.Or at least,they don't work from 
where I am.Slightly more functional are what I like to call 
"Happy Outdials"...which are actually PC Pursuit outdials located on telenet. 
MOST of these systems are local outdialing only,which means you have to have 
an outdial for the area code you wish to call in order for them to work. 
 
The telenet format for these od's are fairly simple,looking like 
 
@201 101 
or(NOT a real OD..) 
@201 101a 
 
or whatever.From tymnet,the same outdilas would look like this... 
 
;311020100101 
or 
;31102010010101 
 
As you can see (you can see,right?) the only difference between them 
is that tymnet requires a "3110" prefix to tell tymnet to call telenet, 
a pair of zeroes where the space was for the telenet format,and ya gotta 
change a character identifier to a numeric (i.e. a 101a becomes 10101, 
a 101b would be 10102,etc.).You can sometimes reach things on telenet from 
tymnet that you couldn't access directly from telenet.This is a boon when 
your favorite telenet outdial suddenly begins refusing collect connections. 
 
Anyway..the happy outdials don't seem too impressive when you first connect 
wwith them...thats because they are waiting for you to wake them up by 
hitting CONTROL E.Once you"ve done that,you'll be greeted by it like this... 
 
************************************************************************** 
;3110xxx00xxxx 
HELLO:I'M READY 
* 
************************************************************************** 
 
What you might not guess from this rather unassuming prompt is that it 
hides a fairly extensive menu of commands that you may or may not be 
able to access.I have fucked with the menus for hours,trying different 
terminal emulators,to no avail.In any case,the menu structure is reached by 
giving the '*' a '?' to contemplate,thusly... 
 
**************************************************************************

more than I will anyway.The options menus look like this when drawn out...

So much for the PC Pusuit od's.One of these days I'll lay hands on a 
PCP Console,amd throw open the network for a few days.In any case,there 
one more variety of OD I'd like to cover here,one which haas been global 
in format every time I've gone to use one,but which is usually inaccessable 
by virtue of being perpetually busy. 
These last ods are located on telenet,and are indistinguishable (nua-wise) 
from the PCP outdials.These od's look like this... 
 
************************************************************************** 
;3110xxx00xxxxx 
 
!(Doesn't offer much,does it?) 
 
to use this thing,just tell it what you want. 
 
!d12017485030(The 'd' tells it to dial) 
 
CONNECT 1200 
************************************************************************** 
 
Thats about it.As more info comes in,I will no doubt add to what has been 
presented here in some future phile.Outdials are an oasis in an 
increasingly codeless and deadly enviroment.They are about 900% safer than 
codes,and most can be accessed via **free** networks.
