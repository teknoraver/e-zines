-------------------------

Note: Formatted in 40 column for your 
lame printer! 
 
Another Note: This is an info file. I 
do not advise using this info, but if 
you want to, what the hell? I can' stop 
you. 
 
Ok.. here's what you need: 
 
1 Blank (un-used) Q-Link Disk 
1 Q-Link Special Certificate Number 
1 Visa/Mastercard (helps if it works) 
1 Name/Address/Fone # Combonation 
 
Ok do it like this: 
 
Get your handy-dandy fone book out, 
and comb through it for something that 
looks like this: 
 
John O'Connor 
58 Stuart Street 
(201)431-0180 
Freehold 
 
Scribble something like that down. Dont 
just make up a name/address/fone combo, 
they'll all have to be for one person.. 
(discussed later..) 
 
Ok so now put in your disk, and strike 
this in: 
 
load"change access",8,1 
 
(Take out your lame cartridges, Q-Link 
has protection..) 
 
Ok so it's loaded now right? Do this: 
 
Go to the access number part. Change 
the access number to something local to 
the guy's name/number you are using. 
(You can just make this one up.) 
 
Also change the modem type. Make it 
"other command driven modems." 
 
You see, when you logon to Q-Link, it 
transfers these stats over.. So if you 
wish to further cut-down on the chance 
of gettin traced, then do as I say. 
 
Ok now make a phone call. Dial up this 
number: 1-800-392-8200. Work your way 
into the system by doing various number 
presses for various info until you hit 
the operator. Then feed him/her this 
story: 
 
I just bought a Commodore 1670 modem 
and it said it came with free Q-Link 
software. I looked through the box and 
I was really interested in the idea of 
Q-Link, so I decided to try it out. 
I got to the part where it asked for 
some "Special Certificate Number" and 
I looked all around the box and 
couldn't find one anywhere.. 
 
They'll then proceed to ask for your 
name/fone/address if they haven't done 
so already. Then they'll check your 
info out. There are two (2) ways they 
can do this: 
 
1) Put you on hold, dial directory 
   assist, and ask for whoever's name 
   on such-n-such a road. If they get 
   the number you said, bingo. 
 
2) Hang up on you, call you in 2 mins. 
 
 
The 1st is nothing if all is in order. 
The second however is impossiable. But 
never fear, some operators do things 
differantly, and some don't even check. 
 
Ok, so scratch down the number the 
guy/gal gives you. It'll look someing 
like this: 
 
50-3991-1028,towels-reign 
 
Ok get that down say "Thanks alot!" and 
load the disk. 
 
Ok you'll get some thing like this: 
 
"Type commands to modem, hit F1 when 
connection is made.." 
 
Then you do your standard ATDTxxxxxxx. 
Fill the x's with your local Telenet 
dialup. (I think we can all figure out 
what that is, correct?) 
 
When you see the connect hit the F1 and 
go for it. It'll ask some bullshit 
questions, like Name and Address.. give 
it what you gave your friends at the 
800 number. 
 
Then on method of payment strike in a 
card. Pop in the card # + experation 
when it asks. Credit-Calc'd cards work 
pretty well with Q as they don't check 
too well. So if all else fails use some 
from there. Also, the experation date 
makes NO differance.. for instance I 
always use 12/91 on all my cards.. it 
dosen't matter at all. Trust me, I know 
about these things. 
 
Hmm.. ok next it'll ask if you want to 
use like JackMeoff14 for a screen-name. 
(Handle). Of course you don't! Hit NO 
and put something good in. Then you're 
off to the races. Have fun! 
 
The only real effort needed to obtain 
free Q-Link accounts is coming up with 
an un-used disk.. I have one some of 
you may wish to make copies of. 
 
You can reach my devine self on this 
fine Bulletin Board: 
 
Tessier-Ashpool 
(908)269-9560 
 
or.. 
 
The Sage's Hut 
(908)269-7042 
 
Some people will trade quite a many 
good things (like Trw accounts!) for 
an account on Q-Link, so this info 
could prove usefull. 
 
Alzo.. if you do come across an un-used 
Q-Link disk, make a back-up! If you 
like Q-Link you will need many copies 
of the blank in order to obtain 
multiple accounts. Trust me, I know. 
 
Ok well this is the end. Turn off your 
buffer now lamer.
