You may remember, I have great respect for the Public Domain group in
Atlant that publishes PERFORATIONS.   Drum is new to me.  I've enjoyed
past issues of SCREAM BABY; the evolution of their copyright policy is
a major thread, if not the raison d'etre, for the zine.  Legal Net News
is nicely done, and references a lot of other internet resources.  -- strick

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS:   PERFORATIONS 5, "bodies, dreams & technologies"


The word "virtual" has been the subject of such a large degree of hype 
that it is difficult to use the term without cringing at the 
trendiness of its sound, and yet, despite its status as the premier 
buzzword of the nineties, it continues to suggest a relationship 
between consciousness and electronic space that is rich and 
descriptive.  Just beneath the term's slick corporate gloss is a leaky 
matrix of nested meanings that invoke key dimensions of the emerging 
culture of the 21st century:  artificiality, simulation, 
representation, mimesis, prosthesis, multi-dimensionality, 
multiplicity, hyperness, velocity, otherness, the mechanical, the 
machinic, high technology, and, by extension, digitalization, fractal 
scaling, transpositionality, and networking.


A close reading of this complex system of semiotic flows reveals a 
thoroughly mapped, but unstable network of faults along which the 
domains of the human and the machine are collapsing into each other 
with increasing speed.  Taken together these faults constitute the 
"new edge" of U.S. culture where separate consciousnesses are 
continually merging into an ever more sexed, violent, hallucinogenic, 
and media-saturated conflation of mindscapes.  This evolving, 
networked collectivity is marked by a growing obsession with 
the traces of the transformation of the human into the cyborg, and 
seems enthralled by recycled transfiguration myths often overwritten on 
the electronic skin of the textual/cultural body with the neon intensity 
of transient, kaleidoscopic tattoos.   Easily distracted, the 
individual elements of the collective gaze hypnotically surf available 
information channels grabbing frames in real-time from first one, then 
another, of the latest technetronic updates to the new suit of 
animated tribal scarrings.  


Fixation on new and improved, bigger and better, longer-living bodies 
facillitates acceptance of devices first constructed as attachments to 
the body, then redesigned for incorporation into the body via 
implantation, or nerve/machine integration (e.g., artificial hearts, 
prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, etc.), as a welcome blurring of the 
boundary between humans and machines.  As the boundary becomes more 
blurred, the domains begin to blend.  It is easy to imagine a future 
in which implantation follows a (plastic) surgical model in which purely 
corrective measures become the foundation for supplemental, elective 
procedures.


With the aid of future developments in present technologies--artificial 
intelligence, bio-chips, synthetic neurons, nanotechnology, artificial life--
the body's rate of absorption of the machine will only increase causing rapid 
advancements in cyborgization.  How will these fields re-define 
already complicated issues of embodiment?  How will cyborgization 
affect changes in social/cultural orientations toward real and virtual 
phenomena?   Which is the metaphor--the body or the machine?



PERFORATIONS 5, "bodies, dreams & technologies", will collect and assemble 
memories, stories and fantasies exploring the relationship between the human 
and the machine, and the impact of this relationship on the creation of 
present and near-future cultures.   We value noise, chaos, fluxus, anarchy, 
dada-streams, nonhierarchalization, improvisation, conflict, discontinuity, 
experimentation, invention and wild speculation.  (We also tolerate more 
reasonned presentations as long as they avoid being too priggish.)  We are 
looking for material--drawings, photography, text, hypertext, computer
graphics, animation, audio and video--that is explicitly experimental in 
the approach taken toward these themes.

In case you don't know, Scream Baby is the output of one
BladeX, based somewhere in Texas. I think a few SB backissues
are to be found in the eff.org gopher area; they're very
intermittent, but they're very cool stuff, one of the best
e-zines on this here net... just hard to get. Check out the

"With the advent of digital writing and digital text reproduction, will
literature -- and the culture based on respectful care for the word --
be eroded?"

                          SCREAM BABY POLICIES

                    "Some people just don't get it"

DISTRIBUTION : Permission is granted to freely re-distribute this
publication via digital means.  You are allowed to, but not limited to,
forwarding copies to your cyber-buddies; posting to newsgroups, message
bases and mailing lists; making available for file transfer on ftp sites
and BBSs; and, <censored> the SPA, you can even copy that floppy.  No
registration or shareware fees or any other charges by Cyberlicious <tm>
will apply to issues distributed in this fashion.

However, the license to create hard copy print-outs remains restricted.

Despite my previous protests, objections, and explicit denial of
permission, many have confessed to printing hard copy versions. So,
recognizing the indaubtable will of the people, I am amending the
restrictions......again. <*sigh*>

You may print hard copies of each issue of Scream Baby, if and
*ONLY* if an annual donation of $5 (or more) is made to an organization
that plants trees in your communites.  In Austin, I endorse Tree Folks
/ 1710 Eva St. / Austin, TX 78704. You may send money here, if there is
no similar organization in your community.

A suitable substitute would be an organization which buys plots of South
American rain forests in order to create a preserve.  Nothing else
qualifies.  Donations to the charity-of-your-choice do not count, nor do
they negate you of your responsibilities under this legally binding
contract.

Just because I don't have any way of checking doesn't mean that the
God-of-your-choice ain't watching.

Contributions to Whale Watcher's Quarterly don't count either, no matter
how cute you think those dorsal fins look.  The only reason I mention
them is to inform you that my cat Mao Tse-Teung, is now a fierce
protector of a large humpback whale named Fringe. I told Mao this was
ok, as long as Fringe didn't come to visit.  We have the certificate
suitable for framing on our refrigerator door, for those who don't
believe.


SUBSCRIPTIONS

"The point about technology is that it has to be a function of some
imaginative life, otherwise it's just a tool, only a tool. Some of the
most boring people on the face of the earth are the people obsessed
with technology, the computer obsessive who wants to tell you what his
computer can do but doesn't really want to tell you what he can do with
his computer"

-- Clive Barker interview, May 1993 issue of Sin Magazine

An idea I've been kicking around is offering advice, tips, hints, and
maybe eventually a FAQ for those who write, publish, and produce
e-zinesters.  Become an advocate for the scene, help people out, etc.
etc.  Perhaps people can even learn from my mistakes, and avoid
repeating them.

                     TIPS for WANNA-BE E-zinesters

One of the first mistakes I made was that I started writing and
collecting material to be published in the first issue of Scream N
*me*me.  What I should have done was write and collect material to be
placed in the *announcement*.  I.e. "Hey, I'm starting a way new cool
e-zine that's better than the rest of this Internet slag heap; send me
submissions".

But no, I wasted my time actually doing stuff instead of just talking
about it.  The inexperience of youth, I guess.

Some of you are now thinking, hey, I'd like to write an e-zine, but what
should I write about?  Fret no more, here are some ideas/titles that you
are free to use!

"Music That No One Else But Me Listens To"
"I Hate Camille" (Paglia)  [ala BID's I Hate Brenda newsletter]
"The Baroque Aesthetics of Mexican-American low-rider artmobiles"
"Hackers v. Crackers" -- the raging debate continues
"1001 Ways to Kill Rush Limbaugh"
"Why Everyone Else on the Internet Sucks"
"How to Make Big $$$$$ Exploiting the Internet"

Uh oh, that last one has just triggered a side rant, involving the issue
of privatizing the Internet.  The future of the internet is "money
talks". Corporations and governments rule the world.  So to all the
stuck pigs, whining crybabies, and academics accustomed to a lifestyle
sponsored by federal subsidy.........get a grip.  The thing that grates
me most is this holy glorification of the net as some vital educational
tool that will save us from America's downward slide into ignorance,
decadence, and decay.  I don't know if the phrase "signal-to-noise
ratio" means anything.  I'm not quite sure which corner of cyberspace
these people have been hanging out on.  But from what I can tell, most
people who use the Internet are JUST FUCKING AROUND!

Oh well, enough ediborial.

For now.

An issue of Scream Baby wouldn't be complete without some reviews.

These get the SBSOA (Scream Baby Seal Of Approval)

RESERVOIR DOGS -- best fucking movie....*ever*.  Walked around like a
tough guy for 12 minutes going, fuck you, ya looking at me? yeah fuck
you, too. what, ya wanna piece of me?  yeah fuck you. That the film
demands such intense and active participation by the viewer that you
*actually* become a cheap, yet professional, hit man.  The film's most
violent scenes occur off-screen.  For example, what Mr. Blonde did in
the jewelry store is never shown, but is created in your own mind based
on the other characters reactions.  What would make professional
criminals coil in such disgust?  *Bam* *Bam* *Bam*  He's a fucking
psychopath.

Fuck you.

Where can I get one of those suits?

FRINGEWARE REVIEW --  One of my previous experiments was a WWIV message
base called the Cyberspace News Network, a collection of original texts
as well as documents appropriated from the Internet. Information was
mainly about the cyberscene, i.e., all that Mondo and Wired stuff.

Far as I'm concerned, the Fringeware mailing list is the Cyberspace News
Network of the cyberscene. Besides keeping me informed of what's going
on, and how I can participate in this that or the other, Don Webb,
regular contributor, is simply the *weirdest*, hippest thing I've seen
in a while.  The guy ain't from this planet.

Subscribe now, fringeware-request@wixer.bga.com.  [I've said that last
issue, so what ya waiting for, special engraved invitation?]

I was going to write all about the physical you can touch paper catalog,
but then remembered that I promised Paco an article for this issue and
then never turned it in.

I better go start now.

"The main things holding people back from doing amazing and interesting
things are lack of imagination and unjustifiable fear of authority
figures or of the opinions of other people. Realizing that most authority
figures and most other people really don't give a shit about you or what
you do blesses you with the freedom to do whatever you have the courage
to do."

        one of the things i had wanted to do in the beginning
        was for SURPUNK to merely "index" other lists ... 
        to hyperlink and crossreference other articles.
        WWW and GOPHER do that with varying degrees of success,
        but with the diverse SURFPUNK subscribers that isn't
        possible via email (yet).  MIME has the potential to help,
        but again, the SURFPUNK readership in general doesn't have
        MIME or the ability to ftp an External-Body block.

        here Andy Hawks speaks of the problem I had hoped
        SURFPUNK would help to solve, instead of make worse ;-)

                  [...excerpt...]

                  - the idea of metalists needs to be explored
                  more...a big bitch-n-moan i've had with the net
                  lately (as i continue to spend less and less time on
                  the piece of s---) is the now-dominating (in my mind
                  anyway) "dung pile" atmosphere....a lot of
                  newsgroups, elists, gopher and ftp sites seem to
                  overlap mroe and more than i've ever noticed in the
                  past, it never seems to stop....people keep
                  spreading the same shit all over the place...

                  here's a typical example....:  a CFP related to
                  cyber-research gets posted to alt.cyberpunk,
                  sci.vorld [new meme, virtual world], mabe
                  comp.org.eff.talk and some other places...so, Joan
                  average FCer reads the same post maybe 6 times,
                  conceivably, in the same day...so then Joan goes to
                  reads er email and finds that three people have
                  forwarded the post to fc:  "i saw this on alt.cp.."
                  "snagged this off sci.vorlds" "grepped through
                  alt.soc.futures and found this"...  now Joan has
                  seen it 9 times...so then Joan goes to gopher for
                  similar stuph, and encounters thirty entries for it,
                  some on ftp....  now Joan decides to go over to the
                  WELL and MindVox, and finds the post has made it's
                  way over there in a few different places on each
                  site... Joan reads the rest of her email -- in her
                  private box, ehr friend Bob sent her a copy:
                  "thought you might wanna see this"...she finds it's
                  made it to a Fringeware post, a Surfpunks post,
                  maybe a library list or two....

                  i know this is a core aspect of the net,
                  decentralized spread of information, but I think
                  there's a big difference between decentralized
                  spread (kinda reminds me of "i can't believe it's
                  not butter" for some reason =) and and spreading too
                  far, wide, and thin...

                  this is the wrong direction to venture into, imho.
                  i don't know why it happens - i could easily guess
                  it's jsut an outcome or extension of too-subjective
                  environments is what it comes down to in the
                  end...it seems to me people feel they're filling a
                  hole with information, but they're not - they're
                  filling a pile.  if you've seen it once, the hole is
                  filled...if you've seen it twice, you've built a
                  pile....

                  now if you take a decentralized atmosphere and try
                  and combine it all together to make a central
                  location for disseminating information (like having
                  all these zines on the fc list), you're jsut piling
                  shit on top of shit.  if only information were a
                  true commodity...... then this wouldn't be a problem
                  in our self-oriented world  .....

                  i really do worry about the possible end results of
                  the meta-* and surf-* approaches to e-information.
                  I think Surfpunks was, for some/most of us,
                  initially viewed as like this harmless neat
                  e-zine... but, i dunno now....it's dangerous...and a
                  lot of e-punks and info-punks see that word and
                  cheer, which i think is ignorant...  surfpunks is
                  groovy and all...but...

                  here's a pretty easy analogy....there's a 7-11 on
                  every street corner....what in the fucking good is
                  building a mega-7-11 in the middle of iowa, kansas,
                  colorado, whatever?  it's useless, so why waste
