COMPUTER CHEATS TAKE CADSOFT'S BAIT

Employees of IBM, Philips, the German federal interior ministry and the
federal office for the protection of the constitution are among those who
unwittingly 'turned themselves in' when a German computer software company
resorted to an undercover strategy to find out who was using illegal copies
of one of its programs.

Hundreds of customers accepted Cadsoft's offer of a free demonstration
program that, unknown to them, searched their computer hard disks for il-
legal copies. Where the search was successful, a message appeared on the
monitor screen inviting the customer to print out and return a voucher for a
free handbook of the latest version of the program. However, instead of a
handbook the users received a letter from the Bavarian-based software com-
pany's lawyers.

Since the demonstration program was distributed last June about 400 people
have returned the voucher, which contained coded information about the
type of computer and the version of the illegally copied Cadsoft program
being used.  Cadsoft is now seeking damages of at least DM6,000 (ECU3,06E2)
each from the illegal users.

Cadsoft's tactics are justified by manager Rudolf Hofer as a necessary
defence against pirate copying. The company had experienced a 30% drop
since 1991 in sales of its successful Eagle design program, which retails
at DM2,998. In contrast, demand for a DM25 demo version, which Cadsoft
offered with the handbook of the full version, had jumped, indicating that
people were acquiring the program from other sources.

Although Cadsoft devised its plan with the help of lawyers, doubts have been
raised about the legal acceptability of this type of computer detective work.
In the case of government offices there is concern about data protection
and official secrets. The search program may also have had side-effects
that caused other files to be damaged or lost.  Cadsoft is therefore
preparing itself for what could be a long legal battle with some customers.
So far it has reached out-of-court agreement with only about a quarter of
those who incriminated themselves.
