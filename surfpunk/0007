Keywords: surfpunk, waffle house, drinking game, secret service

Californians don't know what Waffle House is.  In fact, the closest
Waffle House to San Francisco (that I've been able to find) is near
Phoenix, Arizona, a good 2 day drive through the desert -- but worth it!

After a trip to the Koffee Kettle a few weeks ago, I've had
this idea in the back of my mind.  I posted this to the git.humor
newsgroup to get suggestions, but I think it's rather appros for
the Surfpunk digest.

'Ello.  In my ongoing humor projects, I've decided to create a Waffle
House Drinking Game.  As the game does revolve around Waffle House and
its clones, the beverage of choice is coffee.  So far, I've gotten two
versions.

1) Simple (especially popular at UGA)

    a) Go to Waffle House
    b) Order coffee
    c) Drink coffee
    d) Refill coffee cup
    e) Go to c

Unfortunately the simple version doesn't have much depth, and winning
seems a little difficult.  Therefore, I've started a more complex version.

2) Complex (good for imaginary evenings out)

    There are two parts to the COMPLEX WHDG.  First, you must set the
    initial point target.  Then you must try to drink cups of coffee
    to reach the target.

    To find the initial target, follow these rules.

    If you are in a true Waffle House, start at four points.
    If you are in a Waffle House clone like IHOP, Huddle House,
	Koffee Kettle, or Stuckey's, start at two points.
    For every local police officer in the resturant, add one point.
    For every state or federal police officer (FBI included), add
	two points.
    For every Secret Service agent, add three points.
    If your waitron is male, add two points.
    If the resturant has a view of an interstate highway, add a point
	for every one visible.
    If you are sitting at the bar, add one point.
    For every card game, add two points.
    (More rules to follow)

    After you have your initial target, you then must drink a number of
    cups of coffee to match the target on the following scale.

    Black coffee - one point
    Coffee with sugar - 2/3 point
    Coffee with cream - 2/3 point
    Coffee with sugar and cream - 1/2 point
    Hot Tea - 2/3 point
    Iced Tea - 1/3 point
    Carbonated beverage - 1/3 point
    Milk - 1/3 point
    Orange Juice - 1/2 point

    You may also add points to your score for the following events.

    Car pulls into the resturant parking lot - 1/3 point
    Shift change - 2 points
    Someone recieves a message over a portable radio - 1 point
    Waitron asks how long you are going to be here - 1 point

Well, that's the game so far.  Suggestions are requested.  Thanks for
beta testing the "Waffle House Drinking Game."

Star Trek, Cheers, and VP Debate games have been posted.  Also on
