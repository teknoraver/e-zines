Subject: _Runesong_

Dear Dwellers in Arcana,

While I'm in the plug mode this morning, I thought I would
mention that my friend Edred Thorsson has finally come out with
his long promised book and tape package _Runesong: A Practical
Guide to Rune Galdor_. I have found the cassette a great help in
what has been for me a major stumbling block along the way the
way to learning the lore -- the pronunciation of the now-exotic
sounding words and phrases of the Teutonic tradition.  This
product was designed to remedy that problem.  Pronunciation of
languages such as Proto-Germanic (the reconstructed tongue from
which all Germanic languages are derived) Old English or Old
Norse is usually the kind of thing only learned in the ivory
towers of academia.  With his cassette and booklet, the
information is now available beyond that sphere.

_Runesong_
is available for $19.95 from Runa Raven Press/ POB
180931/Austin, TX 78718

#I just saw on TV a news story where they covered a police demonstration
#of the deadly potato gun.  These are not the sort of potato guns you
#may have played with as a child, using a small tube such as an ink
#cartridge for a pen that had the point cut off and the ink cleaned
#out.
#
#This was a big potato gun.  It appeared to be made from PVC pipe
#about 2 inches in diameter (that's 2.733 decihectares, for our
#Canadian friends  :-).  The cops were shooting potatoes at an old
#car, and managed to smash a side window in one shot from a distance
#of about 10 feet.
#
#The cops said children as young as 12 had been caught with these
#things, and that they are illegal under the same laws that make
#sawed-off shotguns illegal.
#
#The TV spot was carefully filmed to avoid revealing any detail how
#to build one.  Could anyone provide a detailed set of instructions
#how to build a monster potato gun?

I don't know what the law has to say about such devices, but they are quite
the rage back in my hometown.  I was there last week, and saw one that a 
friend of mine built.  They are so popular that all the plumbing and 
irrigation supply stores are sold out on the materials.

My friend built his with a barrel length of about three feet, and a bore
diameter of about two inches.  The combustion chamber was slightly larger
in diameter, maybe five inches.  Standard plastic tubing adapters were
used to connect the two different sized peices.  At the base of the barrel 
was drilled a small hole, with a wooden dowel inserted and glued into place.
This keeps the potato from being pushed too far with the ramrod.  The 
muzzle end of the barrel was filed down to a sharp edge all the way around.
This way, the user can take a potato larger than the bore diameter, and 
manually force it into the muzzle, and the sharp edge trims it off to snugly
fit in the bore, and a snug fit is necessary for good performance, just like
a conventional gun.  At the very end of the gun was a threaded plastic fitting.
This could be unscrewed to squirt a -small- amount of engine starting fluid,
which is mostly ethyl ether.  A squirt lasting about 1/2 a second seemed about
optimal.  Too much or too little results in a weak shot.  Anyway, after 
squirting in a small amount of propellant, quickly screw the plastic plug back
into place.  A push-button barbeque igniter was used to touch off the 
propellant.  It was installed through a small hole drilled in the side of 
the combustion area.  Note- all joints between the pipes, igniter, and dowel
must be sealed with a strong glue.  These things belch fire out of every
seam even when throughly sealed, so be careful.

They are not very loud, and can launch a decent sized baker potato about
150 yards.  They are a lot of fun.  Getting the quantity of fuel just right
takes some practice, but when the ratio of fuel/air is just right, they 
really go!                      

Disclaimer:  These things are potentially dangerous.  Build and shoot one
             at your own risk.  If they are illegal in your area, don't 
             build one!   

Have fun!

Well it seems to have spread across the country :-) I was talking to my

spray a couple shots of Aquanet Hairspray into the other end, screw on the
cap, and using a 30" plunger - push the potato plug down the 36" tube. Aim
(never aim this at a person or animal!!) and fire! It will launch a potato
plug about 1200'!!! 

I will not assume any responsibility for your ability to build this
correctly, choice of fuel, ammo, or choice of target.  You are responsible
for your actions.  Be careful and have fun :-) If this is illegal in your
state, I am not responsible if you break the law.  std. disclaimer. etc.

Subject: Jonesboro Case

Dear Folk,
 
My friend Chris Carlisle of AMER asked me to distribute this.
If you find the case important, please post it.
 
Don Webb
 
 
 
 
July 31st, 1993
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Civil Rights Activists Denounce Religious
Discrimination in Jonesboro, Arkansas
 
Today the Alliance for Magical and Earth Religions (AMER), a
national civil rights and civil liberties organization based
in St. Louis, Missouri, issued a statement denouncing recent
religious discrimination against the owners of a small
business in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  AMER's president and
spokesman, Brad Hicks, called recent events in Jonesboro
"deplorable" and "un-American" and said that he would be proud
to march in a protest against such discrimination planned for
Jonesboro on Sunday, August 1st.
 
The controversy began on June 21st when a Jonesboro couple
named Terry and Amanda Riley opened a bookstore, called Magic
Moon.  The Rileys are self-proclaimed Witches, members of the
religion known as Wicca, and the store specializes in books
and supplies of interest to other members of their faith.
 
According to AMER's sources, on June 23rd their landlord,
accompanied by two local ministers, entered the store and
instructed the Rileys that their store would have to close and
vacate the premises by July 10th (since extended to August
10th).
 
AMER has also heard that a number of local ministers have
denounced the Rileys and their store, falsely accusing them of
being Satan worshipers, and have asked other property owners
and realtors in Jonesboro not to rent to the Rileys.  Since
June 23rd, the Rileys have been seeking new quarters for their
store but have been unsuccessful.
 
AMER, through its president and spokesman Brad Hicks of St.
Louis, Missouri, denounced these actions in strong terms.
"Religious discrimination like this," said Hicks, "is wrong
and un-American."
 
Hicks stressed that if Jonesboro residents are afraid of
Witches, their fears are misplaced. "Above all, the Rileys and
their customers are regular members of the community who have
never hurt anyone."  Hicks and AMER called for calm, hoping
that "cooler heads will prevail."
 
Another reason that AMER believes that the Jonesboro churches
are wrong to denounce Magic Moon is that their denunciation is
based on two factual errors.  First, there appears to be a
widespread misconception that the Rileys and their customers
are Satan worshipers.  AMER and many other national religious
experts agree that there is no more similarity between Wicca
(also known as Witchcraft) and Satanism than there is between
any two other religions, such as Christianity and Buddhism.
Wicca is a form of natural magic and nature worship, usually
worshiping a God and a Goddess of nature and following the
natural cycles.  Religious Satanists, on the other hand, honor
a single God whom they call Satan, Set, or Prometheus, whom
they claim gave the gift of intelligence and consciousness to
human beings.
 
Satanists and Witches do have one thing in common:  a
reverence for human life, which both consider sacred, albeit
for separate reasons.  This contradicts the other apparent
misconception of the Jonesboro residents who have denounced
Magic Moon, who seem to fear that allowing Witches to transact
business in their community is in some way dangerous.
 
Hicks said that most of the image that people have of Satan
worshipers and Witches as dangerous lunatics comes from what
experts call "dabblers." Dabblers are maladjusted young people
or small groups who base their practices or beliefs on what
they've "learned" from horror films, denunciations at church,
or in the most dangerous cases, from misleading information
from ill-informed, self-proclaimed anti-occult "experts"
instead of what the religions of Wicca or Satanism teach.
 
In addition, AMER warned that business practices which
discriminate, such as denying business owners a lease on the
grounds of their religion, are illegal and open up the person
or business that so discriminates to both criminal and civil
liability.
 
"Besides," said Hicks, "I would hope that the horrible
religious conflicts in Bosnia, Northern Ireland, and Algeria
would have taught us by now that religious discrimination is
wrong and dangerous."  In each of the examples cited, terrible
wars or insurrections were started when a majority religion
attempted to outlaw the practices of religious minorities.
 
"How can anyone say that they believe in America while
opposing the free exercise of religion?  How can anyone say
that they believe in civil rights while opposing civil rights
for religions they don't understand?" asked Hicks.
 
The Alliance for Magical and Earth Religions is sending its
President, Brad Hicks, and possibly other members and
officers, to march in support of the Rileys in an event
planned for Sunday, August 1st, in Jonesboro, Arkansas.
 
For more information, contact the Alliance for Magical and
Earth Religions at P.O. Box 16551, St. Louis, Missouri 63105,
or call its president, Brad Hicks, at (314) 878-8402.

        Subject: "Using the Spin of Electrons to Make the Smallest Chips Yet"
        Source:  NYT, 7/6/93, pg B5, William Broad               <100 LINES>

        'Each chip could hold trillions of transistors, compressing vast power
         into a tiny space'
          - a standard circuit line today is about a micron wide
          - 100 times thinner than a human hair

        o with considerable work, it can be seen how to make .1 micron circuits
          - enabling billions of transistors
          - that's been seen as the likely end of the electronics race
        o a new field is emerging that may leap the size barrier
          - circuits perhaps .01 microns wide
          - the width of about 100 atoms
          - enabling trillions of transistors
        o a subtle aspect of quantum mechanics is used - electron spin
          - in a normal electric current, the electrons spin in a random mix
            . quantum states known as up and down
          - by viewing this as analogous to light polarization,
            scientists are creating "off" and "on" states
          - enabling a surprising new dimension to computing

        o Mark Johnson, Bellcore (Red Hook NJ) physicist
          - unveiled his invention of a spin transistor in a recent Science issue
          - his device is only a prototype but its properties excite experts
          - for one thing, it works better as it gets smaller!
          - and it's made of highly conductive metals, not semiconductors
        o Gary Prinz, Naval Research Lab solid-state physicist
          "The 21st century could run on spin polarization.
           It could be the answer to the diminishing-size dilemma of semiconductors.
           Johnson's work is certainly going to make a mark, the question is how large"

        o one application is likely to be computer memory
          - the spin transistor works basically on magnetism
            . fundamentally, itself an expression of aligned electron spins
          - arrays of spin transistors could be information storage banks
            . replacing bulky, slow and unreliable computer disk drives
        o Eli Yablonovitch, U of CA at Los Angeles electrical engineer
          "You'd think, with the end of the 20th century, we'd have banished
           moving parts....what Johnson has done will contribute to their demise"

        o Johnson's work at Bellcore extended his PhD work at Cornell in 1986
          - "Interjection and Detection of Spin Polarization Electrons in Metals"
          - in 1990 he experimented with exceedingly fine films
          - in July 1992, he found very strong signals
            . unlike the weak ones he recorded as a graduate student
          - the polarization efficiency in the target was nearly 100%
            . 'why this should be so is still largely a mystery'
        o what was clear:  shrinking the device redoubled its signal strength
          - theory predicted even further strides
          "As you trap the spins in a smaller volume, the effect gets
           relatively bigger"  Johnson
        o Johnson saw the application in switching, digital revolution's heart
          - his device is a thin gold film between 2 magnetic strips
          - a current sends polarized electrons from the 1st strip into the gold
          - their ability to exit (turn the circuit 'on') depends on the magnetic
            orientation of the 2nd strip
          - passage requires the electrons and the strip all have the same polarity
        o this sandwich thus can act as a memory device
          - the magnetic polarity of the 2nd strip is remembered
            after the current is turned off
          - reading the memory requires only a brief electrical impulse
          - 'arrays of such devices could produce chips that don't need electricity
             to store information - one of the most coveted prizes in computing'

        o it's even possible spin transistors could be used in logic processors
          - if further work in the field is encouraging:  Johnson
          - so far the sandwich has been tested at -297 degrees
          - Johnson expects spin devices working at room temperature in 1993
        o another question is whether the signal amplification of spin devices
          will be large enough for logic applications:  Johnson
          "If other people become interested, within 1-2 years we could answer
           a lot of questions"
        o Bellcore cannot make and sell spin chips, due to legal constraints
         - they have applied for a patent and could reap licensing fees

        o if the answers to these questions are positive, the effects will be huge
          - everything will become dramatically smarter or smaller or both
          - cars could drive themselves
          - large machinery would waste less energy
          - satellites would shrink from yards to inches
          - robots might become talented
          - PCs could have the power of todays supercomputers
        o Dr. Prinz warns that this new frontier is endangered in America
          "The Japanese are very good in magnetics.
           I don't know who is going to do this here.
           The companies are getting out of basic research.  It's a tragedy"
        o a few dozen US scientists has been exploring spin engineering
          - most are at universities
          - some at companies:  Bellcore, 3-M, Honeywell, IBM
            . IBM is working in giant magnetoresistance, a spin phenomenon
            . to improve magnetic disk drives
        o several Federal agencies are studying the work in spin devices
          - including the Advanced Research Projects Agency
          - their funding could pickup the pace of work
          - David Awschalom, U of CA at Santa Barbara physicist:
          "You can now spin engineer systems to do all kinds of unique things...
           Spin devices could be the basis for a new generation of devices"
