Subject: Kahn Sees On-Going Battle On Cryptography 06/14/93

PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 JUN 14 (NB) -- David Kahn,
author of "The Codebreakers", speaking at the Third CPSR
Cryptography Conference, told those assembled that he sees an on-
going battle between government and privacy advocates over personal
and business uses of cryptography.

Kahn began by saying "My thesis is that the growth of cryptography
follows the growth of communication. When there was little literacy,
writing itself was a form of cryptography"

"A great leap forward came in World War I -- the use of radio
brought the need for greater use of codes to insure the privacy of
messages. In the fall out after the war, the use of cipher machines
was attempted but this approach was not really practical until
computers came along," he added.

According to Khan, in recent times, interest in cryptography has
grown dramatically. "When the RSA algorithm was mentioned in
Scientific American, there were 5,000 requests for reprints of the
article; the story "Ultra Secret" about the breaking of the Germans'
code raised interest and threats such as computer "hackers", viruses
and cellular phone fraud raised additional interest in cryptography
and the protection of privacy," he said.

Kahn then moved to his Antithesis: "(The) Government wants to stop the
movement toward privacy. (The) Government wants to know about
criminal and terrorists. It tries to accomplish this objective
through such things as export controls and the Clipper & Capstone
chips," he told the audience.

"The Government sees its activity. not as an additional intrusion
into individual privacy. but as an attempt to maintain the present
state. However, the domain of individual rights has been expanding --
the Miranda warnings, abortion decisions and the more strident
avocation of privacy rights are examples of this trend," he said.

"The Government moves are trying to block the advance of privacy
rather than intrude into present rights. Export limits inhibits
business expansion," he added.

Kahn concluded: "Now we have to look for the synthesis. It's a
matter of "privacy is good" and "business profits are good" versus
"security is good." The question that must be answered is how to
balance these goods. Do we give up the first for the second?"

"The World Trade Center bombing shows that terrorism is here and is
a concern. Government wants to hold back technology. This can't be
done forever but can be done for a while. Government will argue that
the temporary holding back will save some lives and properties," he
said.

In the question and answer period that followed, Bill Murray,
consultant to Deloite and Touche, commented: "When the government
wants us to give up the right to private communications, it must
show us the danger (that warrants it). If drug dealers and
terrorists are the problem, it should be demonstrated that drug
dealers and terrorists are abusing private communications."

In response to a Newsbytes question as to whether the triumph of the
expansion of privacy rights over government concerns was inevitable,
Kahn said: "Privacy is to powerful a force to be stopped. It will
eventually prevail."

Ross Stapleton, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst,
commented: "These changes in information may cause a rethinking of
the concept of national sovereignty. Governments have always have
tried to control the flow of information; with the new technology
and communications capabilities, they cannot. control it any
longer."

Murray said: "We cannot control it but we can criminalize it and
that would be a mistake. By criminalizing drugs, we have
destabilized society. There is so much illegal money from this
policy that courts, law enforcement departments and legislatures
have been corrupted."

Asked by Newsbytes if he saw illegal money growing if the government
tries to rein in the growth of cryptography or tries to make
wiretapping more pervasive, Murray said: "No, it's not analogous in
the money sense. But the criminalizing of anything without real
justification causes destabilization."

Dear Folks,
 
I recieved this electronic version of the AMER police
pamphlet and thought it would be of interest to you.

GUIDE TO DEALING WITH POLICE HARASSMENT
 
from AMER, the Alliance for Magical and Earth Religions
 
 
Introduction
============
 
     Here in the United States, the freedom to think and believe
as you choose are protected by law.  Unfortunately, our legal
system is not perfect; there are some few people out there who
would use it against those who believe differently from
themselves.
 
     It is important to remember that religious belief is not a
crime.  If you are ever harassed for your religious beliefs,
whether by corrupt police following their own agendas or by
honest police misled by dishonest citizens, you must bear in mind
that the legal system is designed to protect you.  This pamphlet
will show you how to **use** the system to your own advantage:
what to do, and especially what **not** to do.
 
     One caveat:  It is assumed that you are, in fact, not guilty
of committing a crime.  While it is true that the system works as
well for the guilty as for the innocent, our purpose here is to
address only the issue of harassment on the basis of religion or
personal beliefs.  If there is an actual crime involved, even if
it is religious in nature or motivation, AMER will not endorse it
or support its perpetrators.
 
     There are several types of action available to law enforcement
officers which can be used to harass the ordinary citizen.  Some
of these are questioning, search and seizure, arrest, and
accusation.  We will touch on each of these, with information
about what the police have to do, and what  they cannot do.  This
knowledge can help you to steer your own course through difficult
times.
 
     One thing you must never, never do:  **do not**, under any
circumstances, physically resist the police.  To do so justifies
their use of force to compel you; don't give a police officer an
opportunity to misjudge the level of force required.  If he is
honest and unwise, or corrupt and out to get you, the result will
be the same:  you will be injured (or even killed!), and he will
be free to continue to harass citizens.  Your resistance must be
passive - in what you **don't do - to be effective.  If you feel
that you are being mistreated by the police, accept it and go
along with it; you will still be alive and free to obtain redress
later, through the Courts.
 
If You Are Questioned
=====================
      Law Enforcement Officers have the right and the duty to stop
and question any citizen, whenever a felony has been committed and
they have reasonable grounds to believe that the citizen may have
been involved in that felony.  If this should happen to you, your
first reaction should be to cooperate fully with the officer.
This is not harassment, unless the questions asked do not or
cannot pertain to any real crime.
 
     At your first opportunity, when you suspect that you are being
harassed, you should ask, "Am I under arrest?"  This forces
the officer to inform you of your official status.  If he or she
does not formally arrest you at that point, then you are still a
"private citizen" with all the civil rights thereof.  You do
not **have** to answer any questions, or allow the officer into any
premises for which he or she does not have a warrant.  Ask the
officer, "What crime is under investigation?"  The answer to this
question should allow you to decide whether the officers questions
are legitimate.  Only then, if you are being harassed, should you
use any of the following tactics.
 
     You should **not** volunteer information about any persons or
incidents, no matter what is  promised to you.  Anything you say
can be used against you and others, and could be used out of
context to mean something you had never intended.  You will not
clear yourself by naming others or describing events.  It is best
not to say a word until you have legal representation present.
 
     Sometimes you could be subjected to bigotry, insult, or
epithets from police who feel that intimidation will get them
results from otherwise reticent subjects.  Do not go into shock, do
not lose your temper and do **not respond in kind; it will only
serve to pour more fuel on the fire and make matters worse.
If you can remember exact words and details, write them down at the
first opportunity and talk with a lawyer about whether you have
adequate grounds for a civil rights complaint.
 
     The police may take you to the station to talk.  If this
happens, ask to have an attorney present.  Then, shut up.  Don't
say anything until the lawyer is there with you, and speak only if
he advises it.
 
     If you are in a public place with a multitude of neutral
witnesses, like an event in a public park, you can speak a little
more freely.  Just remember, witnesses can work against you, too,
so watch what you say and keep your temper.
 
     If you are at another's home when the police come in, you
should keep quiet also.  Avoid incriminating your host.  You really
don't know what grounds are being used for the raid, and you
probably don't **know they are innocent of whatever it is; so
avoid incriminating yourself or others.  In this case, the time to
act is afterwards; see an attorney.
 
     In your own home, if the police ask permission to come in, the
answer should be "NO."  You should step outside and talk with
them.  If the weather is too inclement for that, or if they don't
like this approach, offer to go to McDonald's or to the police
station.  You don't have to let them in without a warrant.  If you
are asked, "What do you have to hide?" turn it around and ask
"What kind of question is that?"  If they are not asking to come
in, but breaking down your door, give way and let them in.  Don't
fight them or make any insults or threats, but remember all that is
said and done, make notes, and get a lawyer.
 
     If the officer looks frightened or angry, take extreme
precautions not to do anything to startle him or make him think you
are about to do him harm.  This is a time of maximum risk to
yourself, so be very polite and don't do anything that may be
interpreted as a threat.
 
If You are Injured
==================
 
     If the worst happens and you are injured during the course of
an improper police action, go to the nearest Emergency Room for
treatment.  Even if the injury appears to be superficial, the
hospital is required by law to notify the police in the case of an
assault.  This will begin the process of documentation for your
eventual complaint or lawsuit.  The hospital's report will be
instrumental in substantiating such a complaint.
 
Search and Seizure
==================
 
     While the law recognizes many different circumstances under
which the police may conduct a search of persons or property, only
a few are relevant to this discussion.  Of course, you are
perfectly within your rights to ask the officer **why** he is
searching you; his answer will help you to determine whether you
have grounds for a complaint.  (You ALWAYS submit to the search; if
the officer is acting improperly, you may file a complaint later.)
 
     The Limited Protection Search is most easily used for
harassment purposes.  The law enforcement officer is permitted, if
he has cause to suspect that a person is armed, to "frisk" that
person for weapons.  While this may be undignified, it is no
more than that; if you are armed, surrender the weapon voluntarily
before the search begins.  This establishes that you are willing to
cooperate with the officer, and limits the scope of further
harassment.  (Of course, if the weapon you carry is illegal, there
are other consequences.)  If you are not armed, it
doesn't matter; even if he were to find contraband on your person,
he probably could do no more than confiscate it, because it might
not be admissible evidence.
 
     If you are a female, you have the right to have a female
witness present during the search.  Another harassment tactic
involves the "Plain View" search, which is not a search at all.
This involves the officer's simply seeing some item which he
defines as contraband; he has the right to confiscate it, as well
as to take any further action as appropriate.  Though this can be
a major inconvenience, you can file a complaint against the officer
through his department's Internal Affairs division, and you may be
able to recover your property.
 
     If you are actually arrested, then the officer may search your
person and all of the surrounding area within your reach.  This
"Search Incident to Arrest" is permitted to insure that the
arrested person cannot obtain a weapon or destroy evidence; any
contraband or evidence relating to the reason for the arrest is
admissible.  You can do nothing about this, so relax.  (It may be
a tactic to rattle you.  Don't let it.)
 
     One special case:  when the property to be searched is an
automobile, the requirement for a search warrant is waived.  The
officer must still be able to prove to the Court that his search is
"reasonable," but he does not have to obtain a warrant to make
the search.  This is because the vehicle is mobile, and could be
gone by the time a warrant could be obtained.
 
     Once again, we cannot make the warning strong enough:  DO NOT
resist a police officer or other law enforcement officer when
he insists on making a search!  Better to submit to the search than
to the arrest or other consequences that could result from
resistance!  If you believe that the search was not reasonable,
take notes as soon as you can.  See an attorney.  If you have a
case, your attorney will deal with it.
 
If You Are Arrested
===================
 
"**You are under arrest.**"  These are words that the common,
upstanding citizen never expects to hear.  However, as a Pagan or
magical practitioner, you must be realistic.  As the world stands,
Pagans, Satanists, Witches and others deemed "radical,"
"non-conformist," or (in extreme cases) "dangerous to society",
face the very real possibility that they may be harassed, arrested,
charged with supposed crimes, or actually prosecuted for those
"crimes."  Whether your arrest is the end of a long series of
harassments, or happens abruptly and surprisingly, there are
certain procedures that the police are required by law to follow if
they don't want the arrest to be deemed invalid in any future court
proceedings.  This section deals with that process, and hopefully,
will include some useful advice on how to
deal with being arrested.
 
     You have probably already been stopped and questioned.  The
officer has informed you that you are under arrest, and your
situation has radically changed.  You are no longer a private
citizen, but rather a ward of the State until such a time as you
are released.  You are protected under Criminal Code from certain
indignities or atrocities (you may not be questioned without an
attorney present, for example, and you cannot be physically
abused), but your civil rights are severely limited.  Let's examine
what rights you **do** have, and how you should exercise them.
 
     Most people have heard the almost ritual language of the
Miranda Warning, mandated by the United States Supreme Court; but
many do not know **what** those words mean.  It is important to
understand this warning; its provisions will govern your behavior
from this point on:
 
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.  This means **exactly** what
it says.  You do not **have** to say anything from this point on,
even to give your name or social security number.  It is strongly
recommended that you exercise this right.
 
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF
LAW.  Again, this means **exactly** what it says.  Every word you
utter may be used against you or others in a future Court
proceeding.  Before you say anything, to anybody, you should
examine it from all angles to see that it cannot be used to
incriminate you or others in the commission of some crime.  Anyone,
including fellow prisoners or jailers, can be called as witnesses
in a courtroom; they can testify as to conversations you had with
them, or to those which they merely **overheard**.  Also, many
prisons and detention facilities are equipped with video and audio
recording devices; be careful not only of what you say, but how you
act in these facilities.
 
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY, AND TO HAVE THAT ATTORNEY
PRESENT DURING QUESTIONING.  It is strongly suggested that you
exercise this right as soon as possible, if for no other reason
than to signal your captors that you cannot be mistreated with
impunity.  Further, it is strongly suggested that you have your
attorney present during **any** questioning, by police,
prosecutors, or anyone else.  Your attorney will know what
questions may and may not be legally asked, and will advise you as
to which questions you should or should not answer.  Also, remember
that the police will take anything that they can get; if
your attorney is not present, you may be subject to more badgering
from them than otherwise.
 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE OR CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY, ONE WILL BE
APPOINTED FOR YOU AT NO CHARGE AND BEFORE ANY QUESTIONING.  It is
suggested that you retain a private criminal defense attorney, if
at all possible, rather than take a Court-appointed Public
Defender.  Not that there aren't some very good public defenders
out there, but most of them are either very young lawyers right out
of law school or old veterans who have become somewhat cynical.
Most of all, in virtually every city, public defense attorneys are
**extremely** overworked; your public defender will
not - and cannot - give your case the concern and effort that you
need at this point.  What you need is a good attorney who has your
best interests at heart, and who will take a strong stand with his
counterpart in the Prosecutor's office.
 
YOU ARE NOW UNDER ARREST.  Most people have no idea of exactly what
this means.  These formal words, uttered by a Law Enforcement
Officer or other official who holds the power of arrest, take you
out of the realm of the private citizen and make
you a ward of the State.  Your captors literally have control over
every aspect of your life.
 
     Take this **very** seriously!  Your captors will exercise
control over what you wear, what and when you eat, even when you
used to demoralize a prisoner and make him as docile as possible.
You must submit to this, or you will be compelled by force.
 
     Until you have been physically transported to a detention
facility, the police do not **have** to let you do anything.  (Even
if you were skyclad when they interrupted your ritual, they
do not have to let you get dressed.  They might simply hand you a
blanket to drape around yourself.)  Be prepared for this.  Also, be
prepared to have all of your personal belongings (purse or wallet,
wristwatch, jewelry, belt and shoes, even eyeglasses) taken from
you.  If you wear contact lenses, you do have the right to ask to
remove them and put them in their wetting solution.  (This is
because the State is now responsible for your
property, and is required to take reasonable action to keep it from
harm.)  You will be given an inventory and a receipt for everything
confiscated, and it must be returned to you when you are released.
The only exception to this is property seized as evidence.  (Your
attorney can advise you as to how to recover this property, after
your case is closed.)
 
     Once you reach the police station, you will be fingerprinted.
Your name, the reason for your detention, and the
date and exact time of your arrest will be noted in a log book, and
your picture will be taken.  Take careful note of the date and time
of your arrest; the law states that you may only be held
for a maximum of 72 hours (less in some states) before the police
have to either formally charge you with a crime (and take you
before a judge for a hearing to set bail) or release you.  If you
are held longer than that without a bail hearing, your attorney can
file a writ of habeas corpus (wrongful detention) and have you
released immediately.
 
     During this 72-hour period, you **must** be allowed one
telephone call.  **Use it wisely!**  It is the one and only one you
will get.  It might be wise, if you think it likely that you will
be arrested or detained, to make arrangements with some trusted
friend or relative beforehand.  That way, you can call this person,
who can act freely in your behalf.  He or she can make as many
phone calls as necessary to secure you a good attorney, a bail
bondsman, or whatever is needed.
 
     As a ward of the State, you are under the State's care.
Police and prison officials can be held personally liable if you
are mistreated, and they know it.  You will be given the basics of
sustenance; do not expect more.  If, for example, you are under a
physician's care and are taking prescribed medicine for a
medical condition, they must continue that medication.  If you are
injured in the course of the arrest, you have the right to receive
medical treatment from a physician.  You will be fed and clothed.
If you wear corrective eyewear or a hearing aid, you will have them
when you see your attorney or when you appear in Court.
 
If You Are Charged with a Crime
===============================
 
     If you haven't done so by now, you can't put it off any
longer.  **Get an attorney**!  A public defender just won't do;
most of the time, he would try to persuade you to accept a plea
bargain (you plead Guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for the
prosecutor dropping the greater charge).  Almost 80% of publicly
defended cases are disposed of in this manner.  Having retained a
good attorney, take his advice; it's what you pay him for.
 
     One other thing you can do:  to the extent permissible by law,
make sure that your case is made public.  The glaring light of
public attention is a potent weapon; it forces the legal system to
operate as it should.  Make sure that the media is informed of the
injustice being done.  AMER may be able to help you with this.
 
The System **Can** Work
===================
 
     We don't want to make you think that there is no hope for fair
treatment from the police.  A new member of AMER recently told us
a story which illustrates that innocence and persistence can be
your best defense.  The member (let's call him Zack for
convenience) was spending a quiet evening at home when someone
suddenly began beating on his front door.  Zack's neighborhood is
a little rough, and there had been a number of robberies there
recently.  When he opened his door a crack to see who was there and
the muzzle of a handgun was shoved into his face, Zack decided to
cooperate to save his life from what he thought were robbers.
Several poorly-dressed men shoved their way into his apartment and
began to threaten him.
 
     With a gun barrel shoved into his mouth, Zack begged the men
to take anything they wanted but to let him live.  They ransacked
his apartment, apparently looking for drugs.  Zack's religious
beliefs forbid him to use drugs, and the searchers evidently did
not find anything to satisfy them, until one man found Zack's
altar!  At that point, religious epithets joined the other threats
and insults.
 
     One of the men then produced an official-looking form, and
held it in front of Zack and demanded that he sign it.  Zack looked
at the paper, and was astonished to discover that it was an
official police "Consent to Search" form.  Mindful of the gun then
pressed to his temple, Zack reached for a pen, but his hands
shook so badly that he could not sign his name.  When the man
threatened him with the pistol, Zack managed to sign the form
shakily, and the man lowered the gun.
 
     The leader of the group identified himself as a police
officer, but did not produce a badge or search warrant.  He seized
one of Zack's occult books and his membership card from an
occult organization, and the group left.
 
     Zack was shaken and in pain, and decided to visit a hospital
emergency room.  When he told a doctor how he was injured, the
hospital called the police, as is mandatory in assault cases.  An
officer took his statement, and told him that his story would be
followed up officially.  The next day, Zack was visited by a police
investigator, who told him that the raid on his apartment was part
of a "drug sweep" through his neighborhood, but could not indicate
whether or when his property would be returned.  At this point,
Zack contacted AMER.  On our advice, he wrote a detailed account of
his experiences, and began to work on an official complaint.  When
Zack contacted Police Headquarters and asked to speak to someone in
Internal Affairs, he was granted an interview.  He showed his
written statement to a Police Lieutenant, who indicated that he was
not going to be charged with any crime, since no drugs were found
in his home.  Zack asked that his property be returned, and
indicated that he would pursue legal action if needed to obtain its
return.   A few days later, Zack received a call from a police
officer who told him to
come and pick up his property.  Although he was treated somewhat
brusquely on his final visit to the police department, his property
was returned without comment on his religious beliefs.
 
     Zack has had no further difficulty with the police, and has
come to the conclusion that the "raid" was the result of a
complaint by neighbors who wished to harass him.  He has no plans
to file suit against the police department.
 
     Though Zack's experience is unfortunate, it shows the value of
a prompt visit to a hospital, a careful written record of his
experience, and his persistent insistence on his rights as a
citizen.  This story also shows that the system, though misused by
some corrupt police officers, was designed to protect the innocent;
Zack's property was returned to him and he was not falsely charged
with a crime he did not commit.

Ok, so whats the trick?


[  For cypherpunks, the trick might be to practice, and to spread your
   cryptowares.  One of the US government arguments for the government's
   ability to "wiretap" all communications is "to maintain the status
   quo".  If the status quo is that everyone is using cryptography
   without wiretaps, it will be harder to make that argument. 
  
   If you're in the US or Canada, Pick up RSAREF and RIPEM from
   rsa.com.    Pick up PEM from ftp.tis.com.  Browse through
   /pub/cypherpunks at soda.berkeley.edu.  Internationally, 
   try the /alo directory at kampi.hut.fi for starters.

   For other ways of working on the issue, I mentioned lots of
   sources in the last SURFPUNK, including the Electronic
   Frontier Foundation and Computer Professionals for Social
   Responsibility.
