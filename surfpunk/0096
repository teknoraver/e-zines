The auditing may indeed be duplicated.  By marketing departments, and for
the same reason as the Denning auditing -- marketing.  Solely.

There is no way that the selected group of people could crack a
half-reasonable cryptosystem in a few weeks.  Real Cryptanalysts spend
months and years working on cracking cryptosystems, and none of the
panelists was a Real Cryptanalyst.  We had all the details of DES,
and it took 15 years to make a dent in it.

But they fooled you -- and maybe a lot of other people -- so there *is*
a function for such review panels.  Sponsoring one is a way to convince
innocent spectators who don't know better.  Marketing.

Subject: Requesting all records of the Clipper review panel
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 93 17:44:10 -0700

This is a draft, which will be sent out within a day or two.

        John

Karl Bell
Deputy Director of Administration
Freedom of Information Act Officer
National Institute of Standards and Technology
Building 101, Room A-110
Gaithersburg, MD        20899

Dear Mr. Bell:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act 
("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. $ 552, on behalf of Mr. John Gilmore for all 
agency records pertaining to and utilized by the Skipjack review 
panel ("Panel").  

This request also requests access to records which must be 
made available under the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
("FACA"), 5 U.S.C. App. II (1972).  Section 8(b)(2) of the FACA 
requires that the supervising agency for an advisory committee 
must assemble and maintain records for the committee; Section 
8(b)(3) of the FACA provides that such records are subject to the 
FOIA.

The Panel's review is being performed pursuant to the 
President's direction that "respected experts from outside the 
government [] be offered access to the confidential details of the 
algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their 
finding."  The Acting Director of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology sent letters of invitation to potential 
reviewers.  

This request for records includes, but is not limited to: 

all records relating to the selection of the Panel members;

all records of the Panel's activities and use of funds [FACA 
$ 12(a)]; 

the charter of the Panel [FACA $ 9(c)]; 

all notices of Panel meetings [FACA $ 10(a)(2)];

all written determinations to close any part of a Panel 
meeting [FACA $ 10(d)];

all records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendices, 
working papers, drafts, studies, agenda or other documents which 
were made available to or prepared by the committee [FACA 
$$10(b) & (c)].  

For instance, the Panel's interim report states that:

We attended an initial meeting at the Institute for Defense Analyses
Supercomputing Research Center (SRC) from June 21-23.  At that
meeting, the designer of SKIPJACK provided a complete, detailed
description of the algorithm, the rationale for each feature, and the
history of the design.  The head of the NSA evaluation team described
the evaluation process and its results.  Other NSA staff briefed us on
the LEAF structure and protocols for use, generation of device keys,
protection of the devices against reverse engineering, and NSA's
history in the design and evaluation of encryption methods contained
in SKIPJACK.  Additional NSA and NIST staff were present at the
meeting to answer our questions and provide assistance.  All staff
members were forthcoming in providing us with requested information.

All records pertaining to this and other meetings of the 
Panel are included within the scope of this FOIA/FACA request.

If the requested records are not in the possession of your 
agency, I ask that you forward this request to any agency that you 
believe may have records that are responsive to this request.  In the 
alternative, I ask that you inform me of other agencies that might 
have such records.  

As you know, the FOIA provides that even if some 
requested material is properly exempted from mandatory 
disclosure, all segregable portions must be released.  [5 U.S.C. $ 
552(b)]  If any or all material covered by this request is withheld, 
please inform me of the specific exemptions that are being claimed.  
If any of the requested material is released with deletions, I ask that 
each deletion be marked to indicate the exemption(s) being claimed 
to authorize each particular withholding.  

In addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to 
release information that may be technically exempt but where 
withholding would serve no important public interest.

As you know, the FOIA provides that agencies may reduce 
or waive fees if it would be "in the public interest because 
furnishing the information can be considered as primarily 
benefiting the public."  [5 U.S.C. $ 552(a)(4)(A)]  Release of this 
material would be of benefit to the public because of the 
importance of public discussion of technology which can enhance 
personal privacy.  

Moreover, in previous FOIA requests to NIST, Mr. Gilmore 
has amply demonstrated his ability and willingness to disseminate 
such information to the general public.  I therefore ask that you 
waive any fees relating to this request.  Mr. Gilmore promises to 
pay up to $1000 in processing costs should this fee waiver be 
denied, so that NIST can begin processing this request while you 
rule on the propriety of this fee waiver.  

If you have any questions regarding this request, please 
telephone me at the above number.  I would be happy to discuss 
ways in which this request could be clarified or somewhat 
redesigned to reflect the agency's filing system and speed the 
search for records.

As provided under the FOIA, I will expect a reply within 10 
working days.



Sincerely yours,



Lee Tien
On behalf of Mr. 
John Gilmore

U.S. Computer May Have Violated Export Regulations

By PAUL RAEBURN, AP Science Editor

NEW YORK (AP) _ The Digital Equipment Corp. abruptly pulled two
powerful new computers off a global computer network out of concerns
about possible export violations, even though the computers never left
the country.

The result of Digital's action was to deny U.S. computer users access
to U.S. computers operating in the United States.

Critics said the episode demonstrates how export laws intended to
regulate weapons technology are not only infringing on American civil
liberties but also stifling innovation and hurting American
businesses.

Digital said its concern was that foreigners could connect to the
computers from abroad, generate data, and illegally export it over the
Internet computer network, which carries data and electronic mail
around the world.

The computers were reconnected to the computer network on July 7, but
access is now limited to people who are screened by the company, Mark
Fredrickson, a Digital spokesman, said Friday.

The computers are not what industry would call supercomputers, but they
do fit the government definition of a supercomputer.

A former Commerce Department official who is now a trade consultant in
Washington said the connection of a supercomputer to a global network
could lead to violations of federal export regulations.

``If it was available overseas and they allowed people overseas to use
it, then technically they were allowing access to a supercomputer to
people they didn't know,'' said Paul Freedenberg, who was the Commerce
Department's undersecretary for export administration at the end of the
Reagan administration.

Freedenberg is an international trade consultant at Baker and Botts in
Washington, the law firm of former Secretary of State James Baker.

He emphasized that he had no personal knowledge of the Digital computer
hookup and that he was speaking of the regulations generally. ``I can't
say Digital violated the law, because I don't know what Digital did,''
he said.

Lee Mercer, Digital's corporate export manager, said making the
computer available was not a violation. A Commerce Department official,
speaking on condition his name not be used, agreed that making the
computer available was not a violation, but that export of data
generated on the computer would be a violation of regulations.

The computer hookup was in place for five weeks in April and May, said
Fredrickson. It was intended to give potential customers the
opportunity to test-drive the computers. It was terminated by company
executives who wanted to avoid any appearance of violating export
regulations, he said.

``None of this has been motivated by anyone from the government
suggesting that we do anything here,'' said Fredrickson. ``This was
simply our own internal people raising the possibility of concern.''

In a separate incident last year, a Digital computer ``bulletin
board,'' offered access to programs for encoding computer data.

Exporting such software is a violation of federal regulations,
Freedenberg said. ``It's a technical data transfer'' that falls under
the State Department's control of munitions export, he said.

Frederickson said the company shut the bulletin board down to ensure
that the software would not be exported illegally. ``Nothing was found
that was thought to be a concern even meriting informing the government
about it,'' he said.

Digital, the nation's No. 2 computer maker after IBM, said that 65
percent of its $14 billion in annual sales are overseas. In December
1991, the Commerce Department charged the company with 62 violations of
export laws and fined it $2.4 million.

It was the largest fine the department had imposed for export
violations. Digital agreed to pay it without admitting or denying
guilt.

The Digital computers connected to the network were two of Digital's
new AXP 4000 computers, operating in a Digital laboratory in Palo Alto,
Calif. The computers, which cost from $77,000 to $100,000, are
considered midsized computers by industry standards.

Freedenberg said that the government would probably soon revise its
outmoded standards that define those models as supercomputers and bring
them under export regulations.

Robert Kaylor, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said the
department was prohibited by law from discussing the details of a
specific case.

Critics called for speedy revision of the export laws, which date from
the Cold War.

``Export control policies are shutting us directly out of certain
markets,'' costing U.S. businesses at least $10 billion a year in lost
exports, said Howard Lewis, vice president of the National Association
of Manufacturers.

``It's harmful to innovation, but we think it's also very harmful to
the privacy interests of American citizens,'' said Daniel Weitzner, an
attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group concerned
with computers and civil-liberties issues.
