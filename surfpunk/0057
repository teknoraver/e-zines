|               {\bf Virtual Sex and other misconceptions.}  When
|               discussing possible application areas, the popular
|               press never fails to ask about pornography.  While
|               this probaby says more about the press' fascination
|               with sex than about VR's potential, many new
|               technologies, including the VCR, {\it do} often
|               survive early stages via niche pornography markets.
|               
|               In a broader sense, the press has done the same
|               disservice to VR that it did to artificial
|               intelligence.  The researchers with the wildest claims
|               get the air time, and the rest of us are left to deal
|               with the unrealistic expectations.  In fact, many
|               researcher are already shunning the term VR and using
|               labels such as "virtual environments" for their work.
|               
|               The popular Steven King film {\it Lawnmower Man} and
|               Timothy Leary's rantings about "electonic LSD" have
|               fueled a misconception that VR in some way involves
|               drugs, or produces a drug-like experience, which is
|               patently false.  The press has also talked at length
|               about bypassing the current I/O technology and
|               establishing direct neural connections, as described
|               in the 1984 William Gibson novel, {\it Neuromancer,}
|               which popularized the term {\it cyberspace.}
|               
|               Randy Pausch, University of Virginia, 
|               in "Hot Topics: Three Views of Virtual Reality",
|               IEEE Computer, Feb 1993, p80.


I think the following is the first copylefted poem I've seen.
(Jason's a nExtDude who wants so build some VR.)

Actually there's haiku (by Bill Joy?) in the sources to "expreserve".
Unfortunately I don't grep them at ftp.uu.net -- "vi" must not be free.
I think I've freed the haiku before, but can't find it now.
                                                                --strick

Greetings, Striq!  :)

Thanks much for the TAZ info!  I am studying it and will reply when
I can be articulate...  Already, it seems like Truth on tap...

---

Bonks.  Fleeps.  Doodledrons.


Things unspeakable speak to me
In the dark,
alone and unafraid,
I greet them.

Leather Goddesses upon high!
They leap down, their whips
flailing about in sudden wind
and Land upon glittering crystal
shelves, which aren't really, and
hang there suspended in plexiglass
disregard of the accepted laws of physics.

Fuck You! they screech, gesturing
at passing Physicists (floating by),
whose confused faces are covered and revealed,
covered and revealed, by their flapping white coats...

Small pieces of paper flutter in the breeze,
holding secrets, secret diagrams, explaining
the true mechanics of the universe,
but MECHanics charge too much,
and who really trusts them anyway?

        well, you can obviously e-pronounce it, do you really need to
        pronounce it?

        [that is a real word, btw]
        
        usually the 1 is an l, like in k-k001.....k-k001 is cool sarcasm....
        
        ie, B1FF is k-k001.....00's are o's....3's are e's....+'s are t's....
