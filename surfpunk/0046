information  among  themselves,  students  and  the  public.
ICVC'93  will  consist of open forums, distinguished keynote
speakers, and  the  presentation  of  high-quality  accepted
papers.   A  high degree of interaction and discussion among
Conference participants  is  expected,  as  a  workshop-like
setting is promoted.
