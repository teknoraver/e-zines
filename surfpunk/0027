Hello!  My name is Bryan S. Blank.  I am 13 years old, and have been given
an account on a VAX running Ultrix for Internet use.  My problem is that
my machine is an 8088 that runs MS-Loss.  I am writing code in various
languages, and always run out of space.  I have always been amazed by the
Sun workstations, and this must be a crazy question, but does anybody have
an extra Sun<cry,sob,weep>?  I have always love Unix and X11, but my
parents don't have the cash, and Tallahassee, FL is so small that I can't
find somebody with one.  This is definetly a insane post, but remember, by
donating a computer to a child, you make America's future much
brighter<sarcastic grin>.  If you would like to reply, please send e-mail
to BBlank@mailer.cc.fsu.edu.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH!<Yes, I am screaming.>
Thanks again.

                                        Sincerely,
                                                 Bryan S. Blank

Subject:  New AT&T Digital Cordless Phone

                      AT&T New Digital Corless Telephone

AT&T today announced a high-power, all-digital cordless phone  with
four times the range of today's conventional cordless  telephones.  The
AT&T Extended Range Cordless Telephone 9530  operates in the 900-MHz
frequency, providing virtually  interference-free conversations with
consistent sound quality up  to one mile from the base.  The AT&T 9530
uses full digital  transmission to encode speech onto a radio signal,
much like music  is encoded onto a CD, and to provide clearer sound
over a longer  range than cordless phones operating in the 46/49-MHz
frequency.   AT&T's spread-spectrum, frequency-hopping architecture,
which is  patent-pending, actually avoids interference by "hopping"
the  radio signal among 50 of the available 173 channels during a
conversation.  If any of the channels experience interference, the
9530 automatically swaps it for a new, clearer channel.  Because  it
operates over a different frequency, the AT&T 9530 is  unaffected by
forms of interference common to 46/49-MHz cordless  phones, such as
garage door openers, baby monitors and radio  intercoms.  It also
performs well in environments typically difficult for conventional
cordless, such as high-rise apartment  and multilevel buildings.  The
random selection of 50 of 173  channels, along with digital speech
encoding, makes it nearly  impossible to eavesdrop on conversations.
The AT&T 9530 was  designed and developed by AT&T Bell Laboratories,
employing  advanced integrated circuit technology developed jointly
with AT&T  Microelectronics.  The AT&T Extended Range Cordless
Telephone 9530  will be available in late spring at AT&T Phone Centers
nationwide  for $449.99.  For more information, call 800-222-3111.
