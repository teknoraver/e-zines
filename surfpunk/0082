Subject: Tough Choices: PGP vs. RSA Data Security

Cypherpatriots,

This is a tough posting to write. I may even be called a quisling, or even
a sternlight!

This may be the most important posting I make during this current
Clipper-Big Brother Chip controversy.

I suggest that we as a community seriously reconsider our basic support for
PGP. Not because of any flaws in the program, but because of issues related
to Clipper and the potential limits on crypto.

Continuing use of PGP causes several problems:

1. If RSA fails to take actions against sites and users, it weakens their
legal position with respect to their patents. The government does not need
licenses in any case, but users of Clipperphones *do* (not the final
end-users, but the suppliers of Clipperphones to non-government customers).


(A case can be made that repudiation of the patents might be a good thing.
I know I have argued this at times. It's hard to know.)

2. The "guerrilla crypto" aspect of the PGP community (and our group) is
charming, but may be counterproductive. If we are viewed as outlaws, the
target even of RSA, then we have almost no influence, save for underground
subversion.

(To put this another way, if we are seen as RSA Data's enemy, we lose a
potential ally. I am suggesting that a coming war between strong crypto on
one side and government snooping on the other will force all participants
to choose up sides.)

3. Supporting a legal version of strong crypto, which RSA Data-approved
programs are and PGP is *not*, is a much more solid foundation from which
to fight possible restrictions on strong crypto.

4. Our time could better be spent by solidifying existing RSA programs,
including RIPEM, RSAREF-derived programs, MailSafe, and so forth. This is
the approach several major companies have taken (Apple, Lotus, Sun, etc.).

I've urged Jim Bidzos to work toward some compromise with the PGP community
(and I think everyone recognizes the positive aspects of this growing
community). This might include creating translation programs so MailSafe or
RIPEM can read PGP files, a reworking of PGP to conform to licensing
requirements, etc.

I'm hoping that Phil Zimmermann can see what the real battle is. The PGP
community is not likely to win their battle in court, and the effect of
such a court battle will be divisive and ultimately may help the government
in its plans. Phil Z. is most unlikely to ever see any real revenues from
PGP.

I think the benefits of a strong, legal, supported crypto product are
greater than the dubious benefits of having a "free" piece of software. At
any reasonable hourly wage, the cost of MailSafe ($125, last time I
checked) is dwarfed by the amount of time crypto activists like ourselves
spend debating it, downloading it, awaiting patched versions, etc.

(All is not rosy on the RSA Data side, either. RSA Data chose to
concentrate on getting RSA built in to e-mail products from the major
companies and chose not to devote much effort to PGP-like personal
encryption products (such as MailSafe, which runs on DOS and UNIX only and
which hasn't changed much since 1988). Support for RSA Data should mean
more support for these kinds of products. We could essentially ask RSA for
a commitment in this area.)

I'm arguing that we should look carefully and see what the real issues are,
who the real enemy is, and then make plans accordingly.

Awaiting your feedback,

-Tim May

Notes on Cryptography, Digital Telephony, and the Bill of Rights
By Mike Godwin

I.  Introduction

      A.  The recent announcement of the federal government's "Clipper
Chip" has started me thinking again about what the principled "pure
Constitutional" arguments a) opposed to Digital Telephony and b) in favor
of the continuing legality of widespread powerful public-key encryption. 
      B.  These notes do *not* include many of the complaints that have
already been raised about the Clipper Chip initiative, such as:
         1.  Failure of the Administration to conduct an inquiry before
embracing a standard,
         2.  Refusal to allow public scrutiny of the chosen encryption
algorithm(s), which is the normal procedure for testing a cryptographic
scheme, and 
         3.  Failure of the administration to address the policy questions
raised by the Clipper Chip, such as whether the right balance between
privacy and law-enforcement needs has been struck.
      C.  In other words, they do not address complaints about the federal
government's *process* in embracing the Clipper Chip system. They do,
however, attempt to address some of the substantive legal and
Constitutional questions raised by the Clipper Chip and Digital Telephony
initiatives.

II.  Hard Questions from Law Enforcement

      A.  In trying to clarify my own thinking about the possible
Constitutional issues raised by the government's efforts to guarantee
access to public communications between individuals, I have spoken and
argued with a number of individuals who are on the other side of the
issues from me, including Dorothy Denning and various respresentatives of
the FBI, including Alan McDonald.
      B.  McDonald, like Denning and other proponents both of Digital
Telephony and of a standard key-escrow system for cryptography, is fond of
asking hard questions: What if FBI had a wiretap authorization order and
couldn't implement it, either because it was impossible to extract the
right bits from a digital-telephony data stream, or because the
communication was encrypted? Doesn't it make sense to have a law that
requires the phone companies to be able to comply with a wiretap order?
      C.  Rather than respond to these questions, for now at least let's
ask a different question. Suppose the FBI had an authorization order for a
secret microphone at a public restaurant. Now suppose it planted the bug,
but couldn't make out the conversation it was authorized to "seize"
because of background noise at the restaurant. Wouldn't it make sense to
have a law requiring everyone to speak more softly in restaurants and not
to clatter the dishes so much?
      D.  This response is not entirely facetious. The Department of
Justice and the FBI have consistently insisted that they are not seeking
new authority under the federal wiretap statutes ("Title III"). The same
statute that was drafted to outline the authority for law enforcement to
tap telephonic conversations was also drafted to outline law enforcement's
authority to capture normal spoken conversations with secret or remote
microphones. (The statute was amended in the middle '80s by the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act to protect "electronic communications," which
includes e-mail, and a new chapter protecting _stored_ electronic
communications was also added.)
      E.  Should we understand the law the way Digital Telephony
proponents insist we do--as a law designed to mandate that the FBI (for
example) be guaranteed access to telephonic communications? Digital
Telephony supporters insist that it merely "clarifies" phone company
obligations and governmental rights under Title III. If they're right,
then I think we have to understand the provisions regarding "oral
communications" the same way. Which is to say, it would make perfect sense
to have a law requiring that people speak quietly in public places, so as
to guarantee that the government can bug an oral conversation if it needs
to.
      F.  But of course I don't really take Digital Telephony as an
initiative to "clarify" governmental prerogatives. It seems clear to me
that Digital Telephony, together with the "Clipper" initiative, prefigure
a government strategy to set up an information regime that precludes truly
private communications between individuals who are speaking in any way
other than face-to-face. This I think is an expansion of government
authority by almost any analysis.

III.  Digital Telephony, Cryptography, and the Fourth Amendment

      A.  In talking with law enforcement representatives such as Gail
Thackeray, one occasionally encounters the view that the Fourth Amendment
is actually a _grant_ of a Constitutional entitlement to searches and
seizures. This interpretation is jolting to those who have studied the
history of the Fourth Amendment and who recognize that it was drafted as a
limitation on government power, not as a grant of government power. But
even if one doesn't know the history of this amendment, one can look at
its  language and draw certain conclusions.
      B.  The Fourth Amendment reads: "The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue,
but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or
things to be seized."
      C.  Conspicuously missing from the language of this amendment is any
guarantee that the government, with properly obtained warrant in hand,
will be _successful_ in finding the right place to be searched or persons
or things to be seized. What the Fourth Amendment is about is _obtaining
warrants_--similarly, what the wiretap statutes are about is _obtaining
authorization_ for wiretaps and other interceptions. Neither the Fourth
Amendment nor Title III nor the other protections of the ECPA constitute
an law-enforcement _entitlement_ for law enforcement.
      D.  It follows, then, that if digital telephony or widespread
encryption were to create new burdens for law enforcement, this would not,
as some law-enforcement representatives have argued, constitute an
"effective repeal" of Title III. What it would constitute is a change in
the environment in which law enforcement, along with the rest of us, has
to work. Technology often creates changes in our social environment--some,
such as the original innovation of the wiretap, may aid law enforcement,
while others, such as powerful public-key cryptography, pose the risk of
inhibiting law enforcement. Historically, law enforcement has responded to
technological change by adapting. (Indeed, the original wiretaps were an
adaptation to the widespread use of the telephone.) Does it make sense for
law enforcement suddenly to be able to require that the rest of society
adapt to its perceived needs?

IV.  Cryptography and the First Amendment

      A.  Increasingly, I have come to see two strong links between the
the use of cryptography and the First Amendment. The two links are freedom
of expression and freedom of association.
      B.  By "freedom of expression" I mean the traditionally understood
freedoms of speech and the press, as well as freedom of inquiry, which has
also long been understood to be protected by the First Amendment. It is
hard to see how saying or publishing something that happens to be
encrypted could not be protected under the First Amendment. It would be a
very poor freedom of speech indeed that dictated that we could *never*
choose the form in which we speak. Even the traditional limitations on
freedom of speech have never reached so far. My decision to encrypt a
communication should be no more illegal than my decision to speak in code.
To take one example, suppose my mother and I agree that the code "777",
when sent to me through my pager, means "I want you to call me and tell me
how my grandchild is doing." Does the FBI have a right to complain because
they don't know what "777" means? Should the FBI require pager services
never to allow such codes to be used? The First Amendment, it seems to me,
requires that both questions be answered "No."
      C.  "Freedom of association" is a First Amendment right that was
first clearly articulated in a Supreme Court case in 1958: NAACP v.
Alabama ex rel. Patterson. In that case, the Court held that Alabama could
not require the NAACP to disclose a list of its members residing in
Alabama. The Court accepted the NAACP's argument that disclosure of its
list would lead to reprisals on its members; it held such forced
disclosures, by placing an undue burden on NAACP members' exercise of
their freedoms of association and expression, effectively negate those
freedoms. (It is also important to note here that the Supreme Court in
effect recognized that anonymity might be closely associated with First
Amendment rights.)
      D.  If a law guaranteeing disclosure of one's name is sufficiently
"chilling" of First Amendment rights to be unconstitutional, surely a law
requiring that the government be able to read any communications is also
"chilling," not only of my right to speak, but also of my decisions on
whom to speak to. Knowing that I cannot guarantee the privacy of my
communications may mean that I don't conspire to arrange any drug deals or
kidnapping-murders (or that I'll be detected if do), but it also may mean
that I choose not to use this medium to speak to a loved one, or my
lawyer, or to my psychiatrist, or to an outspoken political activist.
Given that computer-based communications are likely to become the dominant
communications medium in the next century, isn't this chilling effect an
awfully high price to pay in order to keep law enforcement from having to
devise new solutions to new problems?

V.  Rereading the Clipper Chip announcements

      A.  It is important to recognize that the Clipper Chip represents,
among other things, an effort by the government to pre-empt certain
criticisms. The language of announcements makes clear that the government
wants us to believe it has recognized all needs and come up with a
credible solution to the dilemma many believe is posed by the ubiquity of
powerful cryptography.
      B.  Because the government is attempting to appear to take a
"moderate" or "balanced" position to the issue, its initiative will tend
to pre-empt criticisms of the government's proposal on the grounds of
*process* alone.
      C.  But there is more to complain about here than bad process. My
rereading of the Clipper Chip announcements will reveal that the
government hopes to develop a national policy that includes limitations on
some kinds of cryptography. Take the following two statements, for
example: 
      D.  'We need the "Clipper Chip" and other approaches that can both
provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and
prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.'
      E.  'The Administration is not saying, "since encryption threatens
the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it
outright" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S.
saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product." '
      F.  It is clear that neither Digital Telephony nor the Clipper Chip
make any sense without restrictions on other kinds of encryption.
Widespread powerful public-key encryption, for example, would render
useless  any improved wiretappability in the communications
infrastructure, and would render superfluous any key-escrow scheme.
      G.  It follows, then, that we should anticipate, consistent with
these two initiatives, an eventual effort to prevent or inhibit the use of
powerful private encryption schemes in private hands.
      H.  Together with the Digital Telephony  and Clipper Chip
initiatives, this effort would, in my opinion, constitute an attempt to
shift the Constitutional balance of rights and responsibilities against
private entities and individuals and in favor of law enforcement. They
would, in effect, create _entitlements_ for law enforcement where none
existed before.
      I.  As my notes here suggest, these initiatives may be, in their
essence, inconsistent with Constitutional guarantees of expression,
association, and privacy.

Subject: MEETING SUMMARY: 4-24-93 Cypherpunks Meeting
Cc: tcmay@netcom.com, jim@rsa.com, tenney@netcom.com

Several people have asked for summaries (or minutes) for our physical
Cypherpunks meetings, especially for our "Emergency Ad Hoc Meeting" a few
days ago.

Some Reasons NOT to do Minutes:

* it formalizes a fundamentally informal meeting (recall that Cypherpunks
have no legal status, no structure, no voting procedures, no officers,
etc.).

* some folks may be leery of having their names appear.

* the credit assignment problem: as soon as summaries are written, people
begin to complain that someone else got the credit for their idea, that
their views weren't mentioned in the summary, and so forth. 

* somebody has to take the notes needed to generate the summary.


Some Reasons IN FAVOR of Minutes:

* with 40 people at our last meeting (counting the audio conference call,
via Internet, to Boston and Washington, D.C.), with more than 400 on our
mailing list, and with the Wiretap Chip events, these are historic times.
(Fortunately, the list itself is a valuable archive of our history. Let's
hope good archives are being kept by someone!)

* folks who cannot attend physical meetings may still want to know what's
basically going on. (And perhaps other groups will nucleate and grow.)

* even folks who were at the meeting may want a summary, to keep their
memories refreshed.


So, some pros and cons to writing up a summary. What I plan to do here is
to just write up a very brief snapshot summary, oriented more toward
informing the non-attendees than to reminding the attendees of action items
or things they agreed to do.

Anyone with additions to make is of course encouraged to do so. Using the
"MEETING SUMMARY:" prefix might be useful.


1. The Meeting Itself.

Saturday, 24 April 1993, 12 noon to past 6 p.m. (when I had to leave).
Offices of Cygnus Support, in Mountain View. Approximately 25-30 in
attendance, including several new faces.

John Gilmore was selling issues of "Wired" at cost. 

An amazing conference call was made to sites in Northern Virginia (Bob
Stafford, Paul Ferguson, others) and to Boston (Marc Horowitz, Derek
Atkins, others). What was amazing was that the audio went through the
Internet and was DES-encrypted (for a while at least, until complaints by
one of the sites about the audio quality caused us to turn off the
encryption). Still, seeing an encrypted Internet conference call was
something...a small step toward the world of Vinge's "True Names."

Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security, intended to just speak briefly
about the Clipper Chip, Capstone, and the view of RSA, but ended up staying
and participating for several hours. Mike Godwin, of EFF, was present at
the Boston (I think) site. Glenn Tenney, organizers of the Hackers
Conference and general activist, was also present for the first time. The
other usual folks were there, including many active in cryptography and
data security. (My apologies for not mentioning any other luminaries here.)

All in all, a stimulating meeting.


2. The Theme: The Clipper Chip.

This of course dominated the discussion all day, and was the explicit
reason for the emergency meeting. There's too much to cover here in detail.

Jim Bidzos and Arthur Abraham both presented information on the Clipper
Chip, including a long data sheet from Mykrotronx (sent to Arthur) on their
Myk-78 chip. (Copies distributed, and also faxed to the remote sites.)
There was some debate about who Mykotronx was and whether it was really
independent from the NSA.

Capstone, the follow-on program, is a superset of Clipper and contains the
DSS signature standard (which RSA Data led the fight against...and most of
thought it was a dead issue--then it appeared here!). No public key methods
are known to be incorporated, thought they may be. (Lots of analysis and
question-asking still to be done.)

Reverse-engineering was also discussed. VLSI Technology, the chip company,
is a partner with Mykrotronx and apparently has a tamper-resistant chip
technology. 


3. What Motivated the Clipper Chip?

It appears the Clipper/Capstone program is initially intended to "buy
market share" as quickly as possible, with government offices requiring
Clipperphones (and probably for those they do business with). Perhaps the
intent is undercut competing models and make Clipper the de facto standard,
which can then be made the de jure standard.

Some think the key escrow features were added _late_ in the proposal and
may even be _expected_ to fail (fail in the sense of key escrow agencies
never getting rolling, issues never getting resolved, etc.). This fits with
the idea of built-in backdoor to the enciphered traffic. The Agency may be
more interested in quickly proliferating a breakable "standard" for voice
encryption than in implementing the key escrow idea. (Left unanswered in
this speculation is how court-ordered wiretaps would then be
executed...would the FBI and NSA simply acknowledge the weakness? I don't
think so.)

The secrecy of the Clipper/Capstone project was quite impressive. Bidzos
confirmed again, and convincingly, that he knew *nothing* of this whole
effort until the announcement (or possibly the night before, when a
reporter called him?). Apparently John Markoff, who sometimes reads this
list and can comment if he wishes, had figured out some aspects or had been
told them by a source, and was preparing an article for the "NY Times."
This may've prompted the announcement timing.

Several people commented that several previously-puzzling events become
clearer in retrospect, such as the then-unknown Mykrotronx sniffing around
to get an RSA license (which they don't yet have).

I can't recap all the discussion, much of which was similar to what's been
going on in sci.crypt and elsewhere. Everyone agreed that this was a
seminal event, that the Clipper/Capstone announcement is a crucial event.
 

3. Lobbying Against the Clipper Chip

The profound consequences call for major efforts.

We discussed boycotting products, spreading negative reports, and  reverse
engineering the algorithm and publishing it so software solutions can
spoof/imitate _part_ of the system (i.e., so someone with a SoundBlaster
board or other system can talk to someone with one of these Clipperphones
without escrowing keys or being wiretappable)

John Gilmore has already posted to the list the results of our
brainstorming session to come up with questions to ask the FBI, NIST, NSA,
Congress, and the Administration. Mike Godwin argued that a lot of
embarrassing questions could quickly derail the plan. Others confirmed that
the NSA mathematicians seemed to be put on the spot by the many questions.
That is, it's conceivable this plan could begin to unravel fairly soon. 


4. Educating the Public.

The Boston group took this as their focus of the rest of the meeting (we
went offline after about an hour or so on the conference call). I haven't
heard the results.


5. Lobbying the Legislature and Officials.

Similarly, the D.C. group took this as their area of involvement. No
feedback yet.


6. What Happens if Clipper Flops?

An interesting discussion out in the lobby (and I probably missed many such
interesting discussions!) had to do with scenarios for how Clipper may
fail. Whit Diffie described how the failure could either so greatly
embarrass the Administration that they'd be loathe to try it again (the
Viet Nam Syndrome, applied to crypto) or that it could provoke them to
tighten restrictions even further, perhaps even to the point of an outright
ban on the use of unapproved encryption at *any* level. (Issues of
enforceability, detectability, Constitutional issues, etc., of course exist
and will be points of attack on any such comprehensive ban.)

(The question of whether Clipper and Capstone applies, either now or later,
to *data* came up several times. The Capstone chip is rated at "10-16
Mbps," which implies it is targeted for Ethernet-type speeds, and hence
data. There was general agreement by all I heard that the Clipper/Capstone
program is indeed intended to target more than just voice encryption and
that our fears about restrictions on strong crypto are justified.)


7. Other Miscellaneous Topics

* Since Jim Bidzos was there, the topic of PGP naturally came up several
times. Eric Hughes let this run for a while, then moved the discussion back
to Clipper. Jim Bidzos clearly had some strong opinions, but also did not
want this to be the forum for debating patents and the legality and ethics
of PGP. He did acknowledge, in my opinion, the point that RSA Data Security
had somewhat neglected the individual end-user (in products such as
MailSafe, which hasn't changed since 1988), in favor of the many large
deals with Lotus, Microsoft, Apple, etc., to get RSA installed in their
e-mail software. He acknowledged that in some sense this left an ecological
niche for a product like PGP to fill, though he insisted that such a
product could be legally developed and distributed if it used the "RSAREF"
package and wasn't sold commercially. (There are lots of threads and
keywords here: RSAREF, RIPEM, TIPEM, B-SAFE, Apple's OCE, etc.)

(Some of us continue to hope some accommodation can be reached between RSA
Data and the PGP community. The upcoming battle over strong crypto is a
bigger issue than this squabble. I remain convinced that RSA Data Security
is "on our side" in this fight for continued access to strong crypto. In
fact, in my opinion, the Clipper/Capstone program looks to be a complete
end-run around RSA and public key techniques, a thinly disguised attempt to
seize control of the crypto market from RSA. In this battle, RSA may be
fighting for their economic survival!)

* The issue of the name of our group, the Cypherpunks name, was not
discussed. The U.K. group has apparently picked "U.K. Cryptoprivacy Group"
as their name.

* The normal schedule for meetings will continue, with the next regular
Cypherpunks (Bay Area) meeting on Saturday, 8 May.


Well, this is my summary. Feedback is welcome. While I don't want to take
meticulous notes the way a "Recording Secretary" is supposed to, I don't
mind writing up these kinds of snapshot summaries.

May you live in interesting times, indeed!

SECURITY CHIPS TRIGGER ALARM

Clipper and Capstone open digital back door.

By Mitch Ratcliffe

Washington -- The White House and National Security Agency, as part of
a wide-ranging retooling of U.S. privacy policies, are preparing two
encryption chips for use in the computer and telecommunications
industries.  Privacy advocates cried foul last week because the chips 
include a back door that allows police to monitor communications.

The Clipper chip announced this month can encrypt voice and data 
communications at up to 16Mbps.  Clipper is due to debut in secure
telephones from AT&T Co. this summer.  The second chip, called Capstone
and currently under development at the NSA, is a superset of Clipper that 
will implement the much-criticized Digital Signature Standard to add
authentication capabilities.  Its existence was revealed during a briefing 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge last week.

President Clinton ordered the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology to establish Clipper as a federal standard.  Since the
government is the largest computer customer in the world, its Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) often are imposed on the industry
as de facto standards.

If Capstone follows Clipper into the FIPS requirements, DSS could usurp RSA
 Data Security Inc.'s public-key encryption scheme, which Apple licensed
for  AOCE (Apple Open Collaboration Environment).

But Apple's representative at the NSA briefing, Gursharan Sidhu, technical
director of collaborative computer and leader of the AOCE project, said
he is not worried that the government will force an encryption scheme
on the industry.

"We were given the impression that they are very open to suggestions," 
Sidhu said, adding that the government is faced with a growing conundrum as
it tries to simultaneously protect privacy and maintain its ability
to tap lawbreakers' communications.

"People have the idea that in cellular the security of communications
had gone away, so there is pressure to encrypt. [Without a back door], even
the  casual criminal would be able to communicate with invincible
security," Sidhu said.  "Law-enforcement agencies wouldn't be able to
collect intelligence."

A spokesman for NIST said Capstone will not be introduced unless the
president's review of national encryption policy conclueds it is needed.
But he also said the Department of Defense and NSA are already working
to develope a PCMCIA card-based implementation of Capstone for a 
classified defense messaging system.

The NSA confirmed it is working on Capstone but could not confirm
the Capstone PCMCIA card project.

Clipper and Capstone use a "key escrow" technology that lets 
law-enforcement agencies with a court order unscramble conversations 
and documents.  To reduce the potential for wiretap abuse, two agencies 
to be named by Attorney General Janet Reno will hold half of each key.  The
NSA said the key escrow agents will not be law-enforcement agencies.

Privacy advocates complained that the algorithms that perform Clipper 
scrambling functions will remain classified.  Encryptin technologies
typically  gain acceptance only after cryptographers pore over the
component algorithms and key management systems.

"We can't protect the key escrow features if we reveal the algorithm
to the public ... that's caused some heartburn," said John Podesta, staff
secretary to President Clinton.  "I'm not suggesting that the public
should trust us any more than any other government agency, but we are
doing a more comprehensive review [than any previous administration]."

Podesta said the Clinton team is taking a free-market approach to
encryption, in contrast to the previous administrations, which tried to
legislate simplified approaches.

"In the wireless communications environment, we have to more the ball
forward on security and privacy," Podesta said.  "The jury's still out on 
whether [Clipper] is the answer."

Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security of Redwood City, Calif.,
said the NSA is using Clipper and Capstone in an attempt to confuse the 
market for privacy-enhancing technologies.  "It takes three or four
years fo rthis kind of proposal to die." Bidzos said.  Computer and 
communications companies might withhold support for any standard,
giving the NSA more time to prepare for the encrypted world, he said.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a Washington, D.C.
based public-interest group, has filed 11 Freedom of Information Act
requests for access to Clipper development records.  The group suspects
the NSA and NIST violated the Computer Security Act of 1987, whic limits
the NSA's role in development of public encryption technologies to
providing advice and assistance.  NSA said it developed both chips.

Subject: MYK-78


I've been stalking Mykotronx with phone and smail since right
after the announcement, and finally got through the guy who
kept telling me that I'd undertand if I just knew a little
more crypto, to the guy who really know what was going on and
wanted to tell me.  This is what I found out: 

Mykotronx MYK-78 has been identified as the Privacy "Clipper"
chip.  The "Clipper" name comes from Washington, and the guys
at Mykotronx know about the Intergraph chip.

The data sheets, as those of you who have read them know, are
confusing, incomplete and internally inconsistent.  This is
evident even if you do not consider that they are to implement
the social protocol described by Dorothy Denning (her
19-Apr-93 paper, as published in Cypherpunks).

After some discussions with Mykotronx, I was able to convince
them of the truth of the last paragraph and to have them
explain just what the chip was designed to do.  I would also
like to emphasize that these discussions revealed that the
poor quality of the documentation does not result from any
attempt to obscure the operation of the chip, they were very
forth coming and eager to discuss its operation.  The
deficiencies result more from the nature of a military
contractor's relationship to its one customer: the customer
understands how to use the chip so there's no pressure to get
it described carefully.  Going public was a bit of a surprise
to them, in fact the announcement was made during their
application engineer's vacation.  I am sure there is an
interesting story in this timing, but the people I was talking
to didn't seem to know it. 

On to the chip: 

You don't just hook up a clear-text bit stream to one end and
get a Denning-stream out the other.  It needs a bit of care
and feeding.

At startup it requires a Random Seed (8 bytes/64-bits) and a
crypto-variable CV (10 bytes/80-bits) for its DES-type
algorithm.  This is Denning's "skipjack" algorithm and, like
DES, is a symmetric key block cypher, which performs in all
the DES modes:

64-Bit Electronic Code Book (ECB)
64-Bit Cypher Block Chaining (CBC)
8/16/32/64 Bit Cypher Feedback
64-Bit Output Feedback (OFB)

In the last three modes the encryption of each block is
dependent on the previous blocks.  (If you care to know more
about DES modes, see FIPS-PUB 81 which is cited in the data
sheets.)  

One other thing about Skipjack: Denning describes it as having
"32 rounds of scrambling" and this is supported by the data
sheet's timing charts, which note 64 clocks cycles to complete
an encryption.  Since this would operate on an 8-byte/64-bit
block, with the 15MHz internal clock we appear to have roughly
a 10M-bit/1.3MB transfer rate in encryption/decryption.  This
is fast enough for the average telephone, or several
telephones, or maybe a stereo CD.  It's probably just average
performance for 1 micron technology and some units clock up to
30MHz (they expect 0.8 micron eventually, with improved
performance).

Back to the Crypto-Variable, CV.  The CV is the session key,
is selected off-chip, and must always be accompanied by a 3
byte/24-bit checkword.  Where do you get the check word?...
you ask the chip! If you load a CV with a bad checkword, the
chip sets its ERROR line -- oh, sadness.  But then you can
read out a good checkword, and subsiquently reload the same CV
with the good checkword (happy now?).  The checkword is
actually just the first three bytes from an application of
Skipjack to the CV.

Do all this and the chip is loaded and ready for plaintext. 
You could just give it an Encryption command, and start
pulling cyphertext out the other side, but who would
understand it?  First you have to get the key information out
of the chip and send it to the chip on the other side of the
link.
 
Skipjack is DES-like so to run a decryption mode on the other
chip we're going to have to send it the session key, CV, and
the Initial Vector, IV, which is the starting state of the
stream for the non-ECB modes of operation.  We selected CV
ourselves, and learned its checkword during the startup
experience, but where's IV?

Well, we generate it using "a feature not found in current DES
chips" (data sheet, 1-3).  And quite a feature it is, too.  We
use this command, Generate IV, and it makes all 8
bytes/64-bits of the IV, based on the Random Seed... But
That's Not ALL!

You issue the Generate IV command three (3) times to get the
full 24 byte/192-bit LEEF block.  LEEF = Law Enforcement
Exploitation Field.  (I wrote this down very carefully to be
sure I had it right.)  

...Actually, you issue a Read Data command after each Generate
IV command, but I won't bore you with details.  The first 8
bytes/64-bits are called L1 or LEEF-1, the second 8
bytes/64-bits are L2 or LEEF-2, and then here is the IV we've
all been waiting for, in its full 8 byte/64-bit glory.  You
probably noticed that LEEF is 24 bytes/192-bits long, and has
the structure [L1,L2,IV].  Mykotronx is not supposed to tell
us the structure of L1,L2.

The interesting thing is that [CV,checkword,L1,L2,IV] is a
self-checking unit.  The receiving chip checks it as it is
loaded.  If something is wrong, the chip sets its ERROR line. 
If CV is fermished, you have to get all the way to IV before
you're rasberried.  In transmitting this we are advised to
encrypt CV because it is, after all, the session key.  

OK, so we are encrypting and the other chip is decrypting. 
Suppose something happens and the other chip wants to talk to
us, so that it encrypts and we decrypt.  It has all it needs
to encrypt and we have all we need to decrypt, but one more
thing has to be done.  We need to save the state of the
chaining cypher so we can resume it at the same place in the
chain when we return to encrypting.  Use the Save State
command, which pops out 8 bytes/64-bits of Saved State, SS, or
the current contents of the Skipjack encryption register.  To
make this a bit clearer, if we pulled the Saved State right
after Generate IV, we'd find SS = IV.

The chip's serial number is 4-bytes/32-bits long, not the 3.75
bytes/30-bits Denning reported, but don't worry, _you'll_
never see it.  It and the family key are written in over pins
Vpp1 and Vpp2, which are then burned out.  All chips are
currently planned to have the same family key, but if you
happen to meet a chip with a different family key and it sends
you [CV,checkword,L1,L2,IV], you could understand it.  

That's the main part of what's missing from the data sheets. 
The rest works pretty much as described, and is at a level of
detail too fine to interest anyone except a compulsive
hardware wonk.  Oh, one more thing, on page 1-4 where the
Configuration Register is shown with two "Arm CV" bits, the
one at position D5 should be "Arm IV".

-a2.

ps: I will be at a meeting the rest of the week, so please
don't expect me to respond to requests for clarification until
I return.  Sorry.

-a2.

Here is a handout I've written for our next Portland-area libertarian

How to Protect Your Electronic Privacy
Nick Szabo, April 30 1993
Distribute Freely

We conduct more and more of our legal, political, and private business
over the wires.  Every decade, the number of phone calls that the
government can record for later playback increases by a factor of ten.
Commercial organizations gather and sell our transactions; marketers
and governments cross-reference them, forming our vast electronic
reputation.  The number of e-mail messages doubles every year, and many 
political organizations are coming to rely on networks like Internet and 
LiberNet.  Most e-mail users are unaware that it is the most public 
medium ever invented, and use it to write love letters, letters to their 
lawyer, discussion of illegal activities, etc.  Vast volumes of e-mail 
can be stored on small magnetic tapes and searched in bulk for keywords, 
eg "mari[jh]uana".  The good news is, the computer brings an even greater 
weapon to fight these threats to our privacy and political freedoms: widely 
available, automatic cryptography.

Instead of developing phones allowing truly private conversations, which
are now feasible, AT&T recently put a phone on the market that contains 
the NSA-designed "Clipper" wiretap chip.  All users' encryption keys are 
registered with the U.S. government, giving it exclusive access to 
wiretapping this system's phones.  The use of an unpublished algorithm 
and other features also make the system insecure.  "Clipper" would also
make traffic analysis (finding out who is calling whom, when, etc.)
much easier.  The goal of this government/Ma Bell collusion is to
subsidize the creation of a standard that forces truly private phone
systems off the market.

By purposefully allowing a government backdoor in its "secure" phones,
AT&T has demonstrated its contempt for its customers' privacy.  Here are 
some other long-distance providers that may have more respect.  All U.S. 
line providers are required to surrender to telephone taps under 
government "authorization", but some require more "authorization" than 
others, or otherwise make a greater fuss about it.  Local wiretaps are 
beyond the control of long-distance companies, but long-distance 
eavesdropping is much more difficult if the company uses fiber optic
instead of microwave links.  Ask company representatives for details.

Real phone privacy can be obtained with a veil of encryption, by using
pairs of phones containing privacy chips, which scramble the
signals *and* keep the keys private.  Contact your local business 
telephone dealers for privacy phones from Ericson, Cylink and other
companies.  Keep your eye out for portable-computer-based
software with voice input that can be used to encrypt voice mail
and send it over the networks like e-mail; these may be appearing
on the market or as freeware within six months.

Data privacy can be obtained with public-key encryption
features which have been added to some of the newer e-mail packages
from Microsoft, Apple, Novell, etc.  Beware: most software encryption
has been restricted by the U.S. government to very weak algorithms.
"Cypherpunks" enjoy writing programs to crack the weakened file
encryption in Word Perfect, Lotus, etc.  Be sure the software contains
the new "RSA" public-key algorithm, which probably cannot be cracked
by anybody, even the NSA with their buildings full of supercomputers.
A strong freeware RSA package is also available called Pretty Good 
Privacy (PGP); this is the international standard on the Internet.  
PGP can also be used for protecting the files on your PC.  On an Internet 
machine type "archie pgp" to find out where PGP is available for 
download.  Several BBS systems also have PGP available.

In public key encryption, there are two keys, one used to lock 
(really scramble) the data, the other to unlock (unscramble) the data. 
To join the fun, publish or send your freinds your public key, and
they can then send you messages only you can unlock with your private
key.  You collect other's public keys and do the same.  PGP key 
distribution is based on an informal, voluntary web of trust instead 
of the government's rigid heirarchy which is vulnerable to failure 
at the top.  Just as today's businessmen trade business cards,
tommorrow's businessmen will trade public keys -- if the government
doesn't ban them first.

For more detailed information on electronic privacy, see:

* Your local phone dealer.  If he does not know about privacy
issues and phone privacy products, ask him to find out!
* The May/June issue of "Wired" magazine featuring "crypto-rebels"
on the cover.  A history computer cryptography and the "cypherpunk"
movement, whose goal is to break the government monopoly on cryptography
and to restore our right to privacy in the electronic age.
* "Mondo 2000" #9 (most recent) features two good articles on PGP, and
a third article on protecting our financial privacy from governments.
* The Winter/Spring issue of "Extropy" features and article on digital
cash.  Unlike current electronic funds transfer, digital cash increases
financial privacy.
* On the Internet, the cypherpunks mailing list 
(cypherpunks-request@toad.com) and the newsgroups sci.crypt.  In the
Portland area two Internet providers are agora (293-1772 data) and
techbook (220-0636 data).  
* Organizations helping lobby for electronic privacy: Electronic Frontier
Foundation (eff.org), Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility 
(cpsr.org), Privacy International.  These are not entirely libertarian
