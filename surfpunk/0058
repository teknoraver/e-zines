Someone sends me a copy of Computer underground Digest, to make
sure we're aware of it.  I guess I assume most people on this list also
read CuD -- if you only read one thing on the underground, CuD should
be it.  For that reason, I seldom appropriate from CuD.  I'll
include the headers from a recent CuD so you can subscribe, if
you don't get it from the "comp.society.cu-digest" usenet group. --strick

Hello fellow internetters.  There is a new MUD for meditation, called ZenMOO.   

Everyone is invited.  It is free, and it is cool.  You simply telnet to the
following address:
    

cheshire.oxy.edu 7777
(134.69.1.253 7777)
    

Below are instructions!
==============================
(This file is available for anonymous ftp as follows:
PC4.math.oxy.edu(134.69.1.134):/ftp/pub/zenmoo/zenguide.txt
Use ascii transfer!!!)
    

Hello, and peace.
        
The internet is a holy thing, it is a sacred thing, and it is an internet
thing.  Those who are less enlightened do not understand this.  Any intrepid
internet citizen knows of the mystical nature of the internet.  However,
there has been a lack of real spirituality on the internet.  There's Gopher
(which is not very spiritual), Archie (a brutal, Diety-less barbarian), MUDs,
MUCKs, MUSHes, and on and on.  Where is one to find mental tranquility and
spiritual rest and relaxation?
        
You have found it, if you have found ZenMOO.  ZenMOO is dedicated to
meditation for the weary internet wanderer.  Here is how to use ZenMOO:
        
        
        
        
When you first connect (however you do so), you will need to create a
meditation name.  Think of a good name, and a good password to go with it.
Store both of these in a file for safe keeping.  You can use your meditation
name and password whenever you feel weary and faint.  Enter the following,
substituting the name and password you have chosen.
        
                create <name> <password>
        
You might want to make sure the name is capitalized properly.  Press return
(as always).  You are now connected.  It will tell you so.  Your first
reaction will be to look around, or see who is connected.  Do not do this.
Do not type anything.  Simply take a deep breath, crack your knuckles (if you
have any), and wait.  In a few seconds, your breathing will become regular,
and you will feel very relaxed.  Perhaps a wise saying will appear for you to
read and meditate upon.  (By the way, the next time you connect to the
ZenMOO, type the following to use your meditation name:
        
                connect <name> <password>
        
You do not need to create a new name every time you connect.)
        
Continue to meditate.  When you are more relaxed, and able to move slowly and
deliberately, you have several commands at your finger tips.  Be very careful
not to type too much, however!  I would suggest typing only once a minute.
You must be very still, and very peaceful, or you will disturb the other
meditators.  If you are disruptive, you will be kicked off!  Here are your
commands:
        
                who             (or @who)
                inventory       (or simply "i")
                look            (or simply "l")
                go north        (or simply "north", or even more simply, "n")
                go south
                go east
                go west
                go up
        
Now, to make sure that you are really meditating, and not just in another
shell, you will be asked a question or riddle from time to time.  You will
want to answer as quickly as possible, in order to keep from appearing
asleep.  Students have dozed off during meditation and been booted, loosing
their vital idle statistics, and living in shame.  Let me explain the output
from the "who" command.
        
The first column is the meditator's name.  The second column will tell you
how long they have been meditating, that is, how long they have been idle.
Long periods of idle time are very esteemed, and difficult to get.  The third
column tells you how much total idle time a meditator has accrued, over the
course of many sessions.  The fourth column tells you roughly how long the
meditator has been using the ZenMOO facilities, across sessions.  The last
column is very important.  It tells you the ratio of total idle time to total
usage time.  High percentages mean a very restful, yet alert meditator.  Low
percentages reflect poorly on a fidgety meditator.
        
>From time to time, to facilitate the meditation, wise sayings will be printed
for your reading, meditating pleasure.  Some sayings will be wise statements,
but others will be mantras, computationally formed to maximize the meditation
relaxation and spiritual healing.  To get the full use of the mantras, try
reading them as a chant, concentrating on the breathing and tempo to synch
your spiritual energies.
        
Enjoy the ZenMOO.  Meditate well, and receive your favorite Deity's blessing.
Thank you.

Subject: EDUC: List of Masters and PhD Programs in VR
Date: 13 Feb 93 07:34:42 GMT


   Before I list the compilation of what has been e-mailed to me about
courses of study dealing with VR, I need to state a few things.

   1. Due to being new to Internet and my mailreader, I am unable to
figure out how to clip from more than one message, so any typos seen
below are mine.

   2. Although no one gave me direct permission to repost their
e-mails, I did state that I would post a compilation of what I
received. In other words I hope I am not offending anyone, or breaking
any trusts.

Ok so here is what I have gotten...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     From: joro@panix.com

  I hold a master's degree from New University's Interactive
Telecommunications Program -- part of the Tisch School of the Arts (Nyu's
film, television, and drama dept.)...

  The degree is a cross between art and new technology, stepping also
into the realm of social issues associated with emerging digital
technologies...

                              [Stuff Deleted]

  I can't say enough good things about the program and would suggest
to anyone interested in areas such as VR that they find out more about
the place and perhaps consider sending in an application...

  No PhD offered -- just a two-year/60 credit M.P.S. degree ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     From mel@dcs.qmw.ac.uk

  If you're interested in coming to the UK, we offer PhD places and a
Masters course that includes Virtual Environments.

Mel Slater
Department of Computer Science
QMW University of London,
Mile End Road,
London E1 4NS,
UK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ok, now just a few more things... I would hope that you don't write
to the people that were kind enough to respond to me, I only posted
who it was from, so that I could give credit were credit was due.
Please contact the respective universitys first and see what info you
can find out first.

  And second, I was rather disappointed with the amount of responses.
I would still love any information about colleges with any programs in
VR, and I know (well hope) that there are more than two ...:) So
Please e-mail me any info or leads you may have, and I will once again
compile it and repost.

  Also any information from anyone about self-education concerning VR,
such as what languages would be best to know, what books might be
educational, companies that offer internships, etc, etc, will be
appreciated, by not only me, but by any others trying to get into the
field. Not to mention the VR field that will be boosted by all this
new education.

  Please respond and I will compile and repost.     Thank you,
                                                       Travis Zornes

Spunk Press Manifesto Version 1.1                  January 10 1993

The excuse for the existence of SPUNK PRESS is the desire of some
individuals to see alternative literature continue to flourish, but
this time online!

The policy of SPUNK PRESS is to act as an independent publisher of
works converted to, or produced in, electronic format and to spread
them as far as possible on the Internet and in the BBS society free of
charge. The work may not necessarily originate from someone with net
access. The major interest of SPUNK PRESS is alternative literature
and anarchist material, both old, converted, and newly produced.

We want to help zine editors, flypost authors and others who desire a
wider audience to convert or to produce their works in an electronic
format and give them the opportunity to use our distribution channels,
FTP sites, mailing lists and whatever other means we might have within
our powers.

We welcome fanzines, pamphlets, books and portions of books, articles,
manifestos, quotations, interviews, bibliographies, reviews, posters,
and other material, both in-print and out-of-print.

You can snarf what we have published so far from:

  red.css.itd.umich.edu 141.211.182.92
  /poli/Spunk/texts

This manifesto and other internal Spunk Press documents can be found in
/poli/Spunk/info; in particular, there is an introduction to the archive
in /poli/Spunk/info/Introduction.  To submit material, get the file
/poli/Spunk/info/How.To.Submit from the FTP site mentioned above or contact
the editorial collective.

If you do not have ftp access, you can get documents by sending electronic
mail requests to a mail server (such as ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com).  Type "help"
in the body of the message for instructions to change and list directories,
and retrieve files from the archive.

To get on our mailing list send a note to

  spunk-list-request@lysator.liu.se

so you can be a part of the coordination of actions taken.

The mailing list is the forum for decision making at SPUNK PRESS, but
if there is no clear consensus, or the consensus is at variance with
anarchist ideas, the collective decides.

The collective is composed of people with a reasonable commitment to
doing some aspect of the work at SPUNK PRESS, and will be extended to
those who are like-minded.

To: libernet@Dartmouth.EDU, 76216.2726@compuserve.com, sjackson@tic.com,

I have created a constitution and set of laws for a new country.
These documents are still in the rough draft stage.  Once the
constitution is completed, I WILL be working with Mike Oliver to
actually create the country of OCEANIA which will initially be a sea
city.  I look forward to suggestions on how to improve the
constitution and the laws for this country.

Please note that my first ad in Reason will be running in only about
two weeks.  This ad was created before I had met Mike Oliver so it
doesn't mention Oceania, instead it mentions a country with the
creative name of "Galt's Gulch".  Once this constitution is
completed, a two page ad mainly featuring a picture of our sea city
will be run in Reason.  Mike Oliver and I will be doing everything in
our power to make sure that this project will be completed.

If you would like to comment on this constitution, send me e-mail.
