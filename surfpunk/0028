R U Serious (editor of Mondo2000) said something to the effect that
money is the ultimate current example of virtual reality -- not being
backed by gold or anything real, it's just bits and bytes on paper, in
computers, in stock exchanges.  Monetary transcations today are
basically hard disk writes.

  J S G Boggs, the subject of Philip Haas's intriguing documentary film
"Money Man," is an artistic provocateur whose chosen form of expression
is the creation of homemade currency.  His hand-drawn bills, while not
strictly counterfeit, look enough like the real thing to have alarmed
the autorities in several countries.  In Australia and England he has
been arrested for counterfeiting but later acquitted of the charges.
And in 1991, the Secret Service seized 15 of his bills in a hotel room
in Cheyenne, Wyo.  The agency, while declining to prosecute, refused to
return the bills, which the artist prefers to call "notes."

  More than a superb draftsman, Mr Boggs is an ingenious Conceptual
artist whose finished works, which he calls "transactions," require the
participants to re-think basic notions about money, art, and value.  He
doesn't consider one of his works complete until he has "spent" one of
his fake bills and received real currency in exchange.  The bills
themselves often have whimsical touches, like his signing of his own
name as Secretary of the Treasury, or his initialing the back of a
one-faced bill with a thumb print.

  "Money Man," which has opened in New York and will spread to other
cities at the end of the month, follows the artist on a motorcycle trip
from his home in Pittsburgh to Washington, where he hopes to retrieve
the notes that were confiscated in Cheyenne. ...

  ... The artist has refined a clever spiel to explain the purpose
of his work.  It forces people, he explains, to consider the processes
that determine the value of an object.  It also subverts the art-world
establishment by eliminating the middle man.

  ...
