SURFPUNK Viewer Mail:  

One hypercard query, mailed directly to surfpunk.

The rest of these arise on the FutureCulture list, to which someone
forwarded "surfpunk-0036", the Scientific American posting.
( I forwarded it to the cypherpunks list; someone else must have
sent it to FutureCulture. )  These devolve rapidly ... if you're up
on Public Key Cryptosystems, you don't stand to learn much here. 
Discussion about how encrypted messages fit into the internet
culture interest me, though.   

OBTW, here's blurbage from the new "welcome to surfpunk" message:

     SURFPUNK is currently neither reflected nor digested, but
     rather curated.  This may change in the future.
     Contributions are welcome and appreciated, but my not

     mailart) are subject to minor cleanup (such as reformatting
     huge lines), unless requested otherwise.

Anybody want to work on HyperCard ?

Sean

[ 
  I'm very interested in building a macintosh client for surfpunk
  hypermedia.  I'm not sure HyperCard is powerful enough to maintain
  interaction on a network connection.   HyperCard should suffice,
  however, for "rendering" files ... perhaps a MIME viewer in HyperCard? 

  (I started toying with the THINK Class Library 5.0 but spent several
  days over christmas trying to chase down a bug that wasn't there.  It
  turned out that "int is 4 bytes" doesn't work, at least not in my
  version of THINK Class Library.)

  By the way, I meant the language TCL ("tickle") by John Ousterhout 
  <ouster@sprite.berkeley.edu> when I mentioned TK/TCL.   Ftp TK and
  TCL from sprite.berkely.edu.  Look for a "tcl" directory.  Also
  see comp.lang.tcl on usenet for a FAQ.

  I've got a lot to learn still about Macintosh.  And then [barf] PC.
  I'll certainly be looking for help, but not quite yet.

So, anyone intercepting mail to a certain person can, if the message is
encrypted, request that person's key from the server, and decrypt it
themselves?  Great.  You've convinced me to use it.  NOT.

Seriously, the only way to send secure mail with this sort of
encryption is to exchange keys with the person you're corresponding
with in a secure way, i.e.  meet them in the flesh.

[stands on soapbox]
Sending encrypted mail isn't something we should have to do.  It's not the
Internet's "scene".  The Internet, as I see it, is based purely on trust and
co-operation, and that's a *BIG* win for me.  I like a society where there
aren't any police, and order is maintained by the populace.  You could argue
that we're being constantly watched/opressed by every sysadmin on the 'net,
but how many of them have ever *interfered* with the way the 'net operates?
Not many.  Consider also that most sysadmins on the 'net are also
net.citizens.

Absolutely fucking wonderful.  I believe also that classing them as
"munitions" gives the govt powers to seize said software, which in all
likelihood means the machines on which the software runs.  You want the CIA
wandering through your filestore anytime they like?  This sounds like a
perfect excuse.

I agree in principle with just about everything, but having encryption
devices are useful on some occasions when engaging in activity that,
though not necessarily illegal, could very definitely be used against
you, particularly for blackmail.  No, I've never had problems with
the sysadmins (not in terms of email, but that's another story); they're
not the ones I'm worrying about.  Yes, I'm paranoid.  I like to think
it's worked to my advantage thus far.

Caveat: I'm also so paranoid that the only way I'd provide my key is
face to face, person to person, and I'm also going to try to have a
different key for each separate individual's account (not just person)
that I would send encryption to.

But it would be delightful to keep things as much on the up and up;
the rest of the deleted message is a tribute to why that may not be
possible, sadly.

No, getting somebody's public key from the server wouldn't allow you
to decrypt messages sent to them.  You need the private key to do
that.

The actual danger referred to is that I could make you think MY
public key was the key of, say, Pres. Clinton.  You'd write a
message to Clinton using my key, and I'd intercept it and decrypt it
(since I know my own corresponding private key).  When the message
arrived at the White House, Clinton wouldn't be able to decrypt it,
but by then the damage would presumably be done.

On my system, BSD 4.3 Unix, I was able to modify the command line to work
after reading the man page for tr.  Try:

% echo 'gubhtug gb ribxr fpvrapr svpgvba engure guna fpvrapr' | \
tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

No no no - the key server gives the PUBLIC key of the person - that is
only useful for ENCRYPTING the message - to decrypt you need the private
key, and that only belongs to the person in question and is NEVER distributed.

No no no.  PEM is based on public key cryptography, where you encrypt
with a public key and decrypt with a differeny (private) key.  Your
public key is stored on the server so anyone can encrypt a message to
you.  However, you keep your private key secret so only you can
decrypt a message.

Well, to draw an analogy, do you ever send mail via the post office?
You do??  Since I'm sure you have nothing to hide, why don't you write
