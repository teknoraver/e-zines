"The Spatialization of Information: Personality Constructs Within Cyberspace"
Architectural Thesis Topic - Chris Smaglick

My intitial consideration of thesis topic began to focus on the process
of architectural design as influenced by the tools of the architect.
Investigation into the historical use of pictorial methods and descriptive
geometry marked distinct revolutions in how the architect functioned and
what the profession required of him.

With the fairly recent advent of the computer and the progression beyond
an industrial based society to and "information based society", the
architect's responsibilities and tools will again evolve through another
radical shift.  The main focus of this thesis will delve into the topic
of Cyberspace and the architects ability to design and formulate the
building of a "liquid architecture", or a building form within the
futuristic construct of a digital space.  The process of design within
Cyberspace will require the use of new tools and the formulation of a
new breed of spatial creation and interaction.

The concept of Cyberspace originated from several science-fiction books
by William Gibson, in which a futuristic society was protrayed containing
digitally stored memories (personality constructs), digital silicon
implants, AI's (Artificial Intelligence), cowboys (those who jack into
and manipulate data within cyberspace), and a reconstituted physical
urban landscape based on these variations/extensions of contempoary
society.  The extreme electronic dependence of the physical world begins
to blur the distinction between real space and the virtual space within
the computer.  As defined by Gibsonian logic, cyberspace is a temporal
organization and formalization of information.  By creation of a
digitally-physical space based on specific information attributes,
the manipulation, understanding and communication of the information
becomes the landscape of cyberspace.

The discourse of this thesis initiates in a definition of "real" space and
its attributes, and correlates between the physical "real" space and the
spatialization of information.  In "jacking-in" to cyberspace, one would
be surrounded by the system matrix (communication transit network).  The
need for individual identity within cyberspace, that of simple recognition
or a spatial address, becomes the outlet of the design process.  The
information for structuring an individual space is interpolated from the
specific individual.  By categorizing and analyzing personal attributes,
one can assemble the spatial equivalent of that personality.  Furthermore,
the relation  and organization of a colony of personal "cells" begins to
create interrelations between and within each cell as intrinsic and
extrinsic fluxuations of the base personality constructs. (The use of the
phrase "personality construct" differs from that as discussed in Gibsons
Neuromancer by meaning a spatially structured personality.) )

The initial analytical stage requires the documentation and evaluation
of personality traits, sufficient enough to establish a personality
profile of an individual.  These personality traits will then be formally
related to specific spatial qualities corresponding spatial qualities
portraying each trait (ie. introvert, extrovert - interior spatial
focus, exterior spatial focus).  The process of translation relies on a
specific algorithm capable of analyzing each personality trait and
their relation/interrelation to spatial formations.  After assembling
the personality construct the algoithm will construct a static
three-dimensional model of and for the individual.  Modulation/  and
morphing of these spaces would be incorporated through variations in
personality throughout time, proximity and relation to surrounding
constructs, and placement - "address" within the cyberspace matrix.
