"Michael J. Current" <IAMICHAEL@delphi.com> on FutureCulture 
recommends this essay:

        Stuart Moulthrop, "Deuteronomy Comix."  A review
             of Neal Stephenson's _Snow Crash_.              REVIEW-1 193

It's part of the Jan93 issue of the e-journal "Postmodern Culture" (PMC).  
Below I'm including the CONTENTS from this issue.

It's available for anonymous ftp from "ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu".
Talk gently to ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu -- it's not a unix machine.  
Log in as "anonymous", and don't put "@" in your password.
Spell filenames with all caps.  "cd" into "PMC", but don't use a slash.
Be sure you use ASCII rather than BINARY transfer.  Say things like
"get REVIEW-1.193".  The Jan93 files all end in ".193".  

It appears the authors do not want me to mail out PMC articles
inside SURFPUNKs -- they want you to have to access the archives yourself.
So I don't think they'll mind me mailing the contents and instructions.  
These instructions do tell how to get articles via email instead of ftp.

                                                Happy hacking...  strick

Barrett Watten, "Post-soviet Subjectivity in Arkadii
     Dragomoshchenko and Ilya Kabakov"
 
          ABSTRACT: The break-up of official culture in the
     Soviet Union led to aesthetic developments characterized by
     an intense, utopian, and metaphysically speculative
     subjectivity.  Identifying these "post-Soviet" developments
     with postmodernism would be to misunderstand them, however.
     Aspects of this subjectivity can be seen in the
     installations and texts of Ilya Kabakov, developing out of
     Moscow conceptual art originating in the 1970s and now being
     shown in museums in the West, and in the poetry of Arkadii
     Dragomoshchenko, representative of the 1980s "meta" litera-
     ture from Moscow and Leningrad, now appearing in American
     translations.  Both projects, while formally very different,
     dismantle Soviet authority in ways that are more culturally
     specific than generically postmodern.  --BW
 
 
Jerome McGann, Vitaly Chernetsky, Arkadii Dragomoshchenko,
     Mikhail Epstein, Lyn Hejinian, Bob Perelman, and Marjorie
     Perloff, "A Symposium on Russian Postmodernism"
 
          ABSTRACT: Jerome McGann moderates an email discussion
     among Vitaly Chernetsky, Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, Mikhail
     Epstein, Lyn Hejinian, Bob Perelman, and Marjorie Perloff
     about Russian Postmodernism.  The discussions took place on
     Oct. 26-Nov. 25, 1992.  The symposium includes poetry by
     Arkadii Dragomoschenko, from XENIA, and an essay by
     Dragomoschenko, "Eroticism of For-Getting, Eroticism of
     Beyond-Being" (translated by Vanessa Bittner with Arkadii
     Dragomoshchenko).  A draft of an essay by Marjorie
     Perloff was circulated at the beginning to all participants;
     this essay, and also excerpts from an essay by Mikhail
     Epstein (sent during the symposium), are included the file
     SYMPOS-2 in this issue.  Participants received an advance
     copy of Barrett Watten's essay, available in this issue as
     WATTEN 193.  --EA
 
 
Wendy Wahl, "Bodies and Technologies: _Dora_, _Neuromancer_, and
     Strategies of Resistance"
 
          ABSTRACT: A pragmatic warning for cyborgs seeking to
     resist the "gradual and willing accommodation of the
     machine," the author focuses on the ability of therapeutic
     and cybernetic networks to recuperate resistance. From
     Freudian clinical practice to the historicized future of
     William Gibson's _Neuromancer_, promising theoretical
     disruptions of oppositional pairs are reclaimed in practice,
     often with chilling results. This reclamation is often
     signaled by the material moment when gender oppositions
     break down; in a backlash against their inclusion with "the
     other," the nostalgic and paranoid reaction of male
     theorists excludes the object, locating interiority once
     again within their experience. Is there any space in a
     postnatural future for a female subject with interiority?
 
 
Alan Aycock, "Derrida/Fort-da: Deconstructing Play"
 
          ABSTRACT: Although the writings of Jacques Derrida are
     notable for their playfulness, little attention has been
     given to the possibilities of a deconstructive approach to
     the study of play itself.  Derrida's discussion of the
     "fort-da" game is presented to suggest some elements of such
     an approach, and five examples drawn from participant
     observation of the game of chess are analysed from a
     deconstructive viewpoint.  Some implications of
     deconstruction are offered for further ethnographic
     investigation.  --AA
 
 
Kathleen Burnett, "Toward a Theory of Hypertextual Design"
 
          ABSTRACT: Commencing with a critique of Poster's
     modes of information, this article employs Deleuze &
     Guattari's metaphor of the rhizome to explicate
     electronically mediated exchange, of which hypertext is the
     apparent fulfillment.  The "approximate characteristics of
     the rhizome"--principles of connection, heterogeneity,
     multiplicity, asignifying rupture, and cartography and
     decalcomania--are considered as principles of hypertextual
     design.  --KB
