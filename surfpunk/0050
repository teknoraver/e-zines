Spotting trends has become a small hobby of mine and I just picked up this
announcement - are cars about to go the way of the Dodo, pregnancy drinking
and smoking?


 The first anti-automobile campaign of its kind, "Autosaurus"
is scheduled to hit the air across Canada on February 27, and in
the US this Spring.

 Created for Greenpeace by Canada's Media Foundation,
publishers of Adbusters Quarterly, this model animation depicts old
cars in a wrecking yard coming to life as a dinosaur, then
crumbling in an impotent heap. The voice-over reinforces the
iconoclastic message: "It's coming... it's coming...The End of the
Automotive Age."

 Created by animator Bill Maylone specially for Greenpeace,
this TV spot calls attention to the environmental destructiveness
of cars, and of the need for fuel efficient transportation and
alternate modes of transport.

According to Maylone, "car commercials are so commonplace on
TV that we don't even give them a second thought. But the notion of
an anti-car ad is unheard of. It is bound to create some
controversy simply by its very nature."

 John Bennett, Director of Transportation Campaigns for
Greenpeace, adds: "We've become so accustomed to the idea that we
need a car, that without this casing of steel we are impotent. It
is a belief system that has been carefully instilled in us through
half a century of car advertising. It's time to break thaosaurus is
the activist wave of the future."

 Autosaurout Autosaurus, or about free broadcast
quality copies of the ad, please call Kalle Lasn at (604) 736-9401,
or John Bennett of Greenpeace at (416) 345-8408.

    Subject: CELP speech compression code at cygnus.com:/pub/celp.speech.tar.Z
    
    The code is up for FTP where you-all can get it.  I made both compressed
    and gzip'd versions (gzip gives smaller files than compress, is faster
    to decompress, but slower to compress).
    
    -rw-rw-r--   1 gnu      cygnus    2571835 Feb  5 16:04 celp.speech.tar.Z
    -rw-rw-r--   1 gnu      cygnus    2099441 Feb  5 16:09 celp.speech.tar.z
    
    Much of the tar file is samples of compressed and uncompressed speech,
    (used for testing the code).  The actual C code is about 340K uncompressed,
    and there's also a Fortran version in there.
    
    I have a copy of the actual compression standard, but not online.
    The Information Liberation Front is welcome to a copy -- maybe
    I should just leave it on the table at the next meeting and hope someone
    "anonymously" picks it up and scans it in.  It's public domain, so
    there's no special thrill from liberating it.

      challenges you to speed it up.   -- strick ]




    It occured to me that some people might not get the significance of all
    this, so prehaps I ought to amplify.

    With the ability to compress speech down into the
    same baud rate as, say, a V.32 modem, all one would have to do to have
    perfectly secure voice communications is replace your phone with a
    setup that took in your speech, digitized it, compressed it, encrypted
    it, and sent it over the modem to the other side where this would be
    inverted. Fast enough software compression of voice would mean any PC
    with a DSP card and a V.32 modem could become an unbreakable scrambler.
    The chief problem is that the DSP needed to do decent compression is
    very crunchy, and encryption also tends to be crunchy, so there aren't
    typically enough cycles on your average PC. Of course, were someone to
    commercially market a board that did all this in hardware...
