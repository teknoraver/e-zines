|         Please unsubscribe me from this list.
|         Due to the label "dangerous hacker zine" I was under the
|         impression that this list concerned serious hacking info. I
|         didn't realize that it was so comedy oriented.

I had hoped for a more substantive write up on the SJG trial ... anyone
got one?  In the meantime, we're including the brief writeup by Paco.
(If CuD publishes a better one first, I probably won't duplicate it here.)
I'm glad to see Paco thinks this so positive;  I was concerned that
$50K doesn't nearly compensate for wreking Steve Jackson's business.  --strick

Dear Surfpunks,
(and others)
 
You may have already heard this.  Sorry about crosspostings.
 
The following files may be of interest to those who
may  come under government scrutiny.
 
Some of you may remember when the Secret Service stole
a great deal of property from Steve Jackson Games for files
allegedly owned at one time by an employee.  I pass along the good news
that you can sue the government and win in as little as three years.
Maat has not totally died, let's see if can get the old gal
and running again!

For Lists That Care About Computer Privacy:
 
In case you didn't catch this elsewheres..  I've been covering the
SJG vs. SS trial for certain magazines.  Hopefully you'll be able
to read soon an in-depth, first hand account of the fiasco our paid 
officials attempted to conduct during the SS trial.
 
The bueno news is that individuals and small companies can actually 
sue the US Fed govt for privacy violations, and win.
 
Judge Sparks didn't give a whole lot of airplay to the *damages*
sustained, but this is an important step forward.  The flood 
gates are opened..

Subject: And now for something completely different...

    PGP or not PGP      (from Hamlet Act III Scene I)
    --------------
 
PGP or not PGP - that is the question
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous patents,
Or to take arms against a sea of lawyers,
And by encrypting end them?  To crypt, to sign
No more; and by a program to say we end
The patents and the export restrictions
That RSA is heir to - 'tis a consummation.
Devoutly to be wish'd.  To crypt, to sign.
To crypt - perchance to pem-code:  aye, there's the rub!
For in that test of wills what lawyers may come
When we have shuffled off this PGP business,
Must give us pause.  There's the respect
that makes calamity of such legal restrictions.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of Leavenworth
Th'patent systems wrong, the export laws worse,
The pangs of despis'd lawyers, the NSA's delay,
The insolence of Sternlight, and the spurns
That patient usage of PGP takes
When he himself might his quietus make
with PEM?  Who would this program bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary system,
But that the dread of something after PEM
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourne
No cryptographer returns -- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.
 
    - Apologies to Bill Shakespeare

Subject: Yet another flame about security

The following message was sent by me to obs@world with cc surfpunk.
I got surfpunk's address wrong and it bounced.
meanwhile flame cooled a bit and obs sent me reply saying (more or less):
1) There are ways to cancel a rip-off charge (if you're alert)
2) You're free to do as you want, but why do you trust a waiter with your card
   and not the internet.
I replied, maybe they'll reply and ad-infinitum until we become close friends 
(and I don't think long chats between friends are important to our overloaded 
community). Anyway, here's the original message. I still think it's important 
since people don't suspect the capability of total strangers in sites you've 
never headr of to tap your mail (I wonder if obs gave it a thought).
---------cut/paste (don't swallow/inhale)------------------------
*flame on*

I got an order form from "The Online Bookstore" (obs) saying:	
"Fill in credit card details, etc." Absentmindedly I almost filled it.
Luckily, I was shaken back to reality by the rest of the message:

> ... Please be advised that we cannot guarantee the security
> of your charge card number when it's transferred over the net,
> though we process orders immediately and delete the file at that time.  

Now I KNOW obs are GOOD people. And if I was dumb enough to almost
send my company's card details on the wild blue internet, I don't
blame obs for unintentionally "setting the trap" for me. Both me
and obs proved some degree of gulibility.

So once again brothers & sisters of the Internet:
1) Don't send Credit-card E-mail order forms
   (Even if you're honest! Even if it contains a warning!)
2) Never fill one. It's a tough matrix out there. Somebode ELSE can lift
   your number.
3) Write to your congressman, E-mail your president, do anything
   you can do as citizens of your respective countries in order
   to set-up a legaly recognized encryption/authentication system.

*flame off*
