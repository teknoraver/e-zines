Greetings,

  I just wanted to make contact across the continent, or maybe just the
  phone lines.  I'm interested in any cyberspace/VR heads out there who
  happen to understand Gibsonian logic.

  I'm working on a thesis RE: Spatialization of Information: Personality
  Constructs Within Cyberspace.  Sounds like I know what I'm talking about
  but my heads in the process of info absorb.

Any responses appreciated.  Here's something to catch avid cyberpunks!

*******************************************************************************
  -Something dark was forming at the core of the Chinese program.  The
   density of information overwhelmed the fabric of the matrix, triggering
   hypnagogic images.  Faint kaleidoscopic angles centered in to a silver-
   black focal point.  Case watched childhood symbols of evil and bad luck
   tumble out along translucent planes: swastikaa, skulls and crossbones,
   dice flashing snake eyes.  If he looked directly at that null point,
   no outline would form.  It took a dozen quick, peripheral takes before
   he had it, a shark thing, gleaming like obsidian, the black mirrors
   of its flanks reflecting faint distant lights that bore no relationship
   to the matrix around it. - Neuromancer, 1984 -

Henry, I am enjoying your surfpunk journal.  There is alot of rubbish mixed
with a few perils.  There is alot of stuff on Mondo2000.  Where in Atlanta
or Athens can I get a copy or subscription and I am also looking for
MonaLisa Overdrive.  Please
decribe both publicationPI am new to the world cybertronics!
Talk with you later - Jim Wright

  Can someone help in Athens, Georgia?

  In atlanta -- where to get Mondo2000 -- that's easy -- Oxford Books.
  Try the one on Pharr Road first.  In athens, well, I'm only familiar
  with the "downtown metropolitan complex" of athens, but I thought I
  saw it in the newstand next to the Grill.  Maybe not.

  I don't recommend subscribing; it comes too slow.

  Mondo2000 is kind of the glossy, flagship magazine that made a lot of
  this culture known to the world at large.  Radikal futureYouths like
  to poo poo this rag because it's really nicely produced, widely
  available, has some really accessible articles on musicians, isn't as
  garage-kool as Boing Boing, tries to be tabloid, may make some money
  some day (not yet, R U says), etc.  I make no such judgement.

  Mona Lisa Overdrive is by William Gibson.  Should be an inexpensive
  paperback in any decent bookstore in the Science Fiction shelf.
  Should be trivial to special order, if needed.

                                                   -- strick

 Does anybody know why a person calling himself or herself Hakim Bey
 faxed some kinda hoodoo-voodoo, phony-mojo curse to Whole Earth? We
 don't need no stinking curses to operate in a fucked up manner!

 Curses? By FAX?

 It's the latest fad.

 Somebody fax him a Stare-EO full of rude subliminal shit

 R.I.T.E.S. - A Reality Benchmark

 An erstwhile journalist of the serious media once proclaimed
Virtual Reality as "electronic LSD"...  Aficionados among the
VR community kwickly retorted "Sorry, acid has a better price/performance
ratio"
to settle the issue.  But hey,
just what do thoze nasty
price/performance ratios look like anyway?

 The deeply concerned staff at bOING-bOING has established
a reality benchmark to help track this emerging commodity
index.  In phact, our study is scientifically based on your
experiences, pfeedback, hallucinations, rants, etc.  So please
participate.  Reality is at steak.

 The proposed benchmark is called RITES, for Reality
Immersion Temporal/EcoGnomic Side-F/X.  Costs are based
on the principle that most folx tyre of their toyz after about
six moons.  Your input is EZ - simply figure out:

         1 -     what you ewes to leave reality

         2 -     how much that costs per week (we'll convert to US$)

         3 -     how immersed you get, averaged over the entire
                 session length (%)

         4 -     how long that alters the knob atop your shoulders per
                 session (minutes)

         5 -     how many alternity sessions you typikally engorge per
                 week

 Send experiential data for statistikal analysis to:

         pacoid@well.sf.ca.us

 Data sets will be proffered to the number crunching goddess
 Deuce X. M'Sheena according to the ancient alchymical formula:

         RITES = (Reality Immersion) * (Time/Session) *
                 (Sessions/Week) / (Cost/Week)

 For those of ewe twisted enuf to appreciate stoichiometry,
the RITES benchmark works out to be a percentage of Time/Cost
following the motto: the higher, the better.  So hear is an example
table to launch ur rants:

  Item            Cost/Wk      RI    Time/Session    Sessions/Wk     RITES

 Day Dreamer     $15/26 wk   80%     10 min               7        97.07
 lysergic           $5/hit   75%      6 hrs               1        54.00
 brain machine   $500/26 wk  80%     30 min               7         8.74
 shrooms         $15/gobble  70%     3 hrs                1         8.40
 VR              $10k/26 wk  95%     90 min               7         1.56
 cinema          $3/matinee   5%     90 min               1         1.50
 ESO/tantra      $50         20%     2 hrs                3         1.44
 cocktails       $45 tab     10%     1 hr                 3         0.40

 PS: don't fret about calculating the last column; that task can be
 automated by our great computers, which fill our hallowed halls...

Well & MindVox: I'm on both, I never spend more then an hour every few
weeks on the Well so I just download the conferences I want to read and
leave. I always feel paranoid like the clock is ticking and I don't
like it, I think the Well's pricing is too steep. MindVox is much
better about this because its real cost effective and has a much
edgeier and underground feel to it, it's the real thing, to the Well's
people talking about the real thing.

Speaking of the real thing, what is happening with MindVox? I heard
that Kroupa blew some Wired deadline because he trashed his apartment
and put his fist through a window? I talked to a friend of mine in NY
who said Kroupa, his fiance, Fancher and some other guy from LOD who
wouldn't say his name were in the emergency room yesterday. What was
this all about and is everyone ok now?

Wired: Who are they????? I read on MindVox that they have billboards
and ads all over buses, subways, buildings and it looks as if every guy
who used to write for Mondo is going to be writing for them also, or
intead of Mondo. I know Sterling, Gibson, Markoff (NY Times and
Cyberpunk), Kroupa, Rucker and even R.U.  Sirius are there. Is Mondo over?

                    You are in a tiny hovel.  There are all kinds of
                    books and scrolls cluttering up the place.  It
                    looks like the home of a sage.  In the far corner
                    is a small bed.
                        There is one obvious exit: east
                    A sage.
                    > Sage says in common: Hand Runesword to me.
                    The sage mumbles something about your mother.
                    The sage looks under his bed.
                    You hear the sounds of hooves beating in the distance.
                    Sage says in common: Runesword is a very evil object.
                    The sage drinks some concoction he has created.
                    Sage says in common: Hand Runesword to me.
                    The sage pulls some newts brain from a bottle.
                    Sage says in common: Hand Runesword to me.
                    A skeletal man enshrouded in black rides in 
                                        on his pale horse.
                    The sage looks under his bed.

                    Death peers deep into your soul.
                    Death says: I think that I will give you another chance.
                    Death drops you off in the church,
