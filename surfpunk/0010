Subject: [surfpunk-0010] CRYPT: PGP2.1 invades the matrix
Keywords: surfpunk, pgp, encryption, info-pgp, pem

There are currently two popular publically-avaiable packages for public
key encryption, the RSAREF package from RSA Associates, and the "the
world's most popular and politically controversial public key
encryption" package, called PGP, for Pretty Good Privacy.  RSA will
claim that PGP violates its patents if used without a liscence, and you
can't get a lisence for it.  RSAREF is what I'm favoring for the
SURFPUNK project; it's problem is that it cannot be exported outside of
USA and Canada.  RSAREF is closer to what will probably become the
internet standard for Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM), and I think foreign
implementation of RSA are beginning to show up.

Eventually I'll post more about RSAREF.  But for now, there's a new
version of PGP out (it looks like it's only for PC, right now), and
it's interesting to see it start to trickle through the global net,
right on through forbidden political barriers ...

These postings are from "Info-PGP: PGP Digest, Volume 1 : Number 36".
I include banner for Info-PGP at end.

Subject: PGP v. 2.1 Released
Date: Mon, 7 Dec 1992 20:49:36 GMT

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

PGP 2.1 Available
- -----------------

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Version 2.1 is now available, from Europe.
This new version of the world's most popular and politically
controversial public key encryption program has numerous bug fixes
over version 2.0, and several new features.

For example, you can now display the MD5 hash of a public key, to
facilitate verifying it over the telephone with the owner of that
public key.  Also, it is now possible to send via email an
unencrypted signed message without putting the whole message in
Radix-64 format, to make it possible to read without PGP.  This is
analogous to the PEM MIC-CLEAR signed message functionality.

PGP 2.1 incorporates many patches from the user community to port it
to more platforms.  And it runs faster.  Also, a lot of annoying bugs
and ergonomic oversights have been fixed.  PGP 2.0 fans will find
many rough edges have been smoothed out.

The filenames are pgp21.zip for the MSDOS executable release, and
pgp21src.zip for the source code release.  You must have PKUNZIP
version 1.1 or later to unzip them, or they won't unzip.  The primary
initial FTP sites that have it are:

Finland:    nic.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100)
            Directory: /pub/unix/security/crypt/

Italy:      ghost.dsi.unimi.it  (149.132.2.1)
            Directory: /pub/security/

As previously, this prohibited and politically popular program will
probably propagate through the same channels as PGP 2.0.  Of course,
if you live in the USA, you really shouldn't be using it.

If you have any questions about where else to get it, contact Hugh
Miller, at hmiller@lucpul.it.luc.edu.  Hugh can send you the latest
evolving list of FTP sites, BBS phone numbers, and other sources.

    PGP v. 2.1 is gradually making its way out into the electronic world.  It
has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and should soon
be up on most if not all Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN software.

    On the Internet, there are many sites to try for anonymous ftp:

    nic.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21.zip      (MSDOS binaries + docs)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21src.zip   (Source code + docs)
        /pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21.tar.Z    (Source code in compressed
                                                 tar format)

    van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca  (192.48.234.1)
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.1/pgp21.zip
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.1/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/crypto/PGP-2.1/pgp21.tar.Z

    ghost.dsi.unimi.it  (149.132.2.1)
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.tar.Z

    pencil.cs.missouri.edu  (128.206.100.207)
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/crypt/pgp21.tar.Z

    soda.berkeley.edu  (128.32.149.19)
        /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp21.zip
        /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp21src.zip
        /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/pgp21.tar.Z

    eugene.utmb.edu  (129.109.9.21)
        pub/pgp/pgp21.zip
        pub/pgp/pgp21src.zip
        pub/pgp/pgp21.tar.Z

    For those lacking ftp connectivity to the net, nic.funet.fi also
offers the files via mail.  Send the following mail message to
mailserv@nic.funet.fi:

    ENCODER uuencode
    SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21src.zip
    SEND pub/unix/security/crypt/pgp21.zip

This will deposit the two zipfiles, as 15 batched messages, in your mailbox
with about 24 hours.  Save and uudecode.

    The Northern Lights BBS in Troy, NY, has both PGP21.ZIP and
PGP21SRC.ZIP for free download. Call (518) 237-2163 at 300-2400 bps 8N1
24 hours a day. Then login directly to the pgp account as follows:

        tnllogin: pgp
        Password: key

and help yourselves.  Thanks to Daniel Ray of tnl for this fine service.

    Another private BBS from which you can obtain PGP for the simple price of
the long-distance call time is the Grapevine BBS, the largest BBS in Arkansas.
It's run by Jim Wenzel in Little Rock.  John Eichler, a PGP user at Grapevine,
sent me the following information for your edification and enlightenment:

>   The GRAPEVINE BBS in Little Rock is the largest BBS in Arkansas.  To
>   help people obtain a copy of PGP21, the GRAPEVINE has set up a special

--  Thanks, John!

    If none of these sites do it for you, let me know.  Film at 11.

    Best regards!

P.S.:  If you come across sites where it's posted -- especially FREE ACCESS
sites -- please drop me a line (info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu).
I'd like to maintain a current list as part of a PGP FAQ list.  Thanks to the
many correspondents who have helped to contribute to this list on an almost
daily basis!

   Info-PGP: PGP Digest   Tuesday 8 December 1992  Volume 1 : Number 36
                Hugh Miller, List Manager / Moderator

    Info-PGP is a digested mailing list dedicated to discussion of Philip
Zimmermann's `Pretty Good Privacy' (PGP) public-key encryption program for
MS-DOS, Unix, VMS, Atari, Amiga, SPARC, Macintosh, and (hopefully) other
operating systems.  It is primarily intended for users on Internet sites
without access to the `alt.security.pgp' newsgroup.  Most submissions to
alt.security.pgp will be saved to Info-PGP, as well as occasional relevant
articles from sci.crypt or other newsgroups.  Info-PGP will also contain
mailings directed to the list address.
    To SUBSCRIBE to Info-PGP, please send a (polite) note to
info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.  This is not a mailserver; there is a
human being on the other end, and bodiless messages with "Subject:" lines
reading "SUBSCRIBE INFO-PGP" will be ignored until the sender develops
manners.  To SUBMIT material for posting to Info-PGP, please mail to
info-pgp@lucpul.it.luc.edu.  In both cases, PLEASE include your name and
Internet "From:" address.  Submissions will be posted pretty well as received,
although the list maintainer / moderator reserves the right to omit redundant
messages, trim bloated headers & .sigs, and other such minor piffle.  I will
not be able to acknowledge submissions, nor, I regret, will I be able to pass
posts on to alt.security.pgp for those whose sites lack access.
    Due to U.S. export restrictions on cryptographic software, I regret that I
cannot include postings containing actual source code (or compiled binaries)
of same.  For the time being at least I am including patches under the same
ukase.  I regret having to do this, but the law, howbeit unjust, is the law.
If a European reader would like to handle that end of things, perhaps run a
"Info-PGP-Code" digest or somesuch, maybe this little problem could be worked
around.
    I have received a promise of some space on an anonymous-ftp'able Internet
site for back issues of Info-PGP Digest.  Full details as soon as they firm
up.
    Oh, yes: ALL CONTRIBUTIONS CONSIDERED AS PERSONAL COMMENTS; STANDARD
DISCLAIMERS APPLY.
