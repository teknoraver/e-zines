The current issue of the Economist, as is its wont each year, rates
organizations that have "networking" value (like the trilateral
commission, Skull and Bones, etc).  This year's list of the world's
most significant include:

 o - Internet and Usenet
 o - The Illuminati

Ominously, these two are numbers 2^4 and 17 on the list!

The year-end issue of The Economist has an article on "influential
networks" that mentions both the Internet and Bavarian Illuminati, not
to mention such lesser organizations as Opus Dei, The Freemasons, and
the Communist Party.

I looked at the log on our main gopher server and saw that between
November 2 and December 7 there were 35,135 different machines that
contacted our main server, and there were 1,006,275 requests
(transactions) done by the server.  About 75% of this is from outside
the University of Minnesota. I don't know if this qualifies as critical
mass though :-).

Subject: "WAX" in San Francisco (Help!) + other playdates

A request for HELP here,

as well as the bi-monthly posting of where my film is playing, in
case you want to catch it.

===========================================================
"WAX or the discovery of television among the bees" (85:00)
===========================================================

WAX opened on Friday (Jan. 1st) at the Roxie Theatre in San
Francisco. Due to a negative synergy apparently common the last
several months between the papers and the houses that show
independent films, there were NO REVIEWS for the opening, as far
as I know. So if you live in San Francisco, and have any
familiarity with the film, could you please mention it to people
you know. As luck would have it, there was at least a really good
writeup by Richard Kadrey in the winter Whole Earth Review (RK
also wrote a review in Mondo back in August)... but it is really
word of mouth which will save this run.

The number at the Roxie is : (415) 863 1087

The film moves over to the UC in Berkeley on Friday, Jan. 8, for
2 days, (9 shows). There is are some new chances for press
there, but I am afraid that the same situation may hold true...
so, hello Berkeley... are you out there? If you know about WAX,
please tell someone else about it.

If you don't know anything about the film, you can write me, and
I will send you a text file (about 70k now) with newspaper
reviews, and a variety of descriptions; included are some net
reviews I either found, or was lucky enough to have forwarded on
to me. The film has already made 2 "10 best" lists here in New
York (NY Press and another).


You can write me at:

artist1@rdrc.rpi.edu            (my name is David Blair)


Obviously, I am self-distributing, in case you wonder why I have
taken the taking the liberty of posting.


-------------
Following are some quotes, to warm you up, then the listing of
playdates up until spring:


William Gibson (author, Neuromancer, Count Zero, etc.) on WAX:

"Authentically peculiar. Like something from the network vaults
of an alternate universe."

William T. Vollman (author, "You Bright and Risen Angels", "The
Iceshirt", "The Rainbow Stories", all Penguin/Viking Press)

"I admire your dark and paranoid visions in all of their
intergalactic complexity."

Larry McCaffery (editor, "Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook
on Cyberpunk and Postmodern Fiction", Duke University Press):

"WAX strikes me as a truly major accomplishment, intellectually
rich, verbally inventive, visually stunning, and -- perhaps most
remarkable of all -- as emotionally resonant as any film I've
come across in recent years."

Brooks Landon (author, "Aesthetics of Ambivalence: Rethinking SF
Film in the Age of Electronic (Re)Production", Greenwood Press)

"WAX is like no movie you have ever seen. Call it postmodern,
postcyberpunk... or post cinema, the point is this 85 minute
celebration of the possibilities of "electronic cinema" may well
indicate the future direction of SF film, if not "film" itself.

Timothy Leary

"WAX is a treat for the eyeballs, a delight for the receptor
sites, a brilliant illumination for our left brains and our right
brains!"




Here are the screenings:

Jan. 1-7
Roxie, San Francisco
Sat, Sun: 2,4,6,8,10 / Mon-Thur 6,8,10 (except no show Wed. at 8)
(on film)

Jan. 8.9
UC, Berkeley
Friday: 5,7,9,11 / Sat: 1,3,5,7,9

[I deleted all the other dates ... they're in Chicago and Edinborough
and places like that ...  :)   --m]

Subject: The Story of the Anti-Jed
To: surfpunk@osc.versant.com (Surfpunk Technical Journal)
Date: Thu, 31 Dec 92 16:18:25 EST

Originating from the Sunny Seaside Sub-Tropical Paradise of Melbourne, FL USA
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

	I don't know if the subscribers of the SurfPunk Technical Journal are
familiar with the famous Brother Jed, but if not all one must do is substitute
your favorite self-righteous wandering in-your-face evangelist. 
	Brother Jed tours College Campuses across the United State as part of
his Campus Ministry USA Tour. He always has an entourage of disciples studying
in the art of condemning HO-MOH-SEX-YOU-ALLS (much handwaving), anyone
wearing spandex (lusty, lusty, lusty), red-headed women (the color of their
hair is the color of their heart, and red is the color of the satan), actually
anywomen who are freethinkers (the last time I saw his wife Sister Cindy, she
was literally barefoot AND pregnant), all college females are semen swallowing
fornicating whores, and we're all enrolled in the college of destruction 
majoring in eternal damnation. I have seen Brother Jed wave the bible dare
people to find passages in there that say anything against him, and then when
the entire membership of AEPi (a jewish fraternity) start yelling quotes back
in unison he carries on as if nothing has happened, he typically doesn't 
respond to questions ans such from the audience but one time I happened to see
him talking to a large group of black students who had asked him about slavery
in the bible, he tried to explain that some races were just plain made inferior
to others so that they could serve others. I just mention this to show that he
sometimes is using bad judgement in talking to folks.
	So here follows salvation, the story of the anti-jed...

     Someone wrote me a wonderful letter asking me to tell the tale of the
anti-Jed.  Gather "round, keeds, 'Cos Auntie Maim has a story for you!

     It began at the University of Minnesota Campus, where Jed isn't seen
around much anymore.  Maybe he felt he couldn't tame this hotbed of
Homma-sexuals, pagans, hoodlums, and Wiiiild Rebels.  Maybe the Sister Cindy
Lookalike contest was partly responsible. Or maybe it was the anti-Jed.
     Rumors of the anti-Jed sprang up a few years ago,  When a few friends of
mine started their chapter of the Campus Crusade for Cthuhlu.(Remember, Keeds,
Cthuhlu Cthaves!)  This was the same year a guy stood in front of Coffman Union
giving $100 dollars to all the students there who were working their way
through college.  He was rumored to be the anti-Jed.  
     The anti-Jed was supposed to be the exact opposite of Brother Jed...kind,
tolerant, friendly,with a sense of humor and a penchant for worshipping street
meters and the odd Express Teller Machine.(put in your donation to the Money
God, fill out the Sacrifice forms, and if the Money God is pleased, he'll spit
out money for you.  If the Money God isn't pleased, he will chew up your card,
and never give it back.)  In fact, the anti-Jed was rumored to be several
people, just because there were reports of him EVERYWHERE.  People would follow
lines of chalk that connected into a huge pentacle with The anti-Jed standing
in the middle in bikini briefs, sunglasses, and usually holding discussions
about bisexuality in Congress, the proper sacrifices to the Killer Squirrels
who hung out near campus, (large, rude and scruffy beings, who insisted on
snacks.  Squirrel muggings were rumored in Northrup Mall, and they would
saunter into classrooms looking for food.  They were The anti-Jed's totem
animals.)  Sometimes Brother Jed would be haranguing a group of students, and
the most pointed, embarrasing questions would silence him for a couple of
minutes, or trip him into saying something insanely stupid.  We had no doubt it
was an Anti-Jed in one of his incarnations.For Example:
    The AJ:  If all americans worshipped Jesus, would all the dry oil wells
flow again?
    The Jed-a-roni: Yes, they would.
    AJ: So you're saying that God and Jesus is holding oil, and therefore our
economy hostage until every man, woman, and child is Born Again?
    Yes, the anti-Jed managed to make Brother Jed admit that God was an
Eco-terrorist.(Eco for economy and environment.)
     Sometimes Brother Jed would look haggard, gray faced and dull eyed.  We
hypothesized that the Anti-Jed must have been haunting his concience with
rationality, kindness, and other thoughts that were alien to his nature.  Not
long after, he left, and hasn't been seen for a few years now.  Probably for
easier prey--like the students of MSU in Montana, where I now live. Heh he hee.
     Though I can't be the dark and scruffy specter that the anti-Jed was back
home at the U of M, I can go on in the spirit he forged in us... This spring,
I'm going to mobilize somestreet theater, to be ready when Jed or his sidekicks 
appear to win the hearts of the poor kids here.  Elvis worship, with a
translator for Elvis-ese and Brother-Jed-ese.  The anti-Jed would have wanted
it that way.

                                    Ignorance and hate is fatal,
                                    La Mort.

Subject: Slack and Flat Tires in Manila
Date: Tue, 29 Dec 92 10:54:53 -0600
From: humphrie@ssc.wisc.edu

Quoted from a wire story by Eileen Guerrero, AP:

MANILA, Philippines -- Convinced flat tires were the key to salvation,
religious cultists deflated tires on scores of buses and cars Monday,
paralyzing traffic throughout the city. ...

"This is God's order to let out air," said Honora Dimagila, 44, who was
arrested Monday. "Air is from God. This is the solution to the crisis in
our country."

Cults enjoy a wide following in the Philippines, the only predominately
Roman Catholic country in Asia. The military has sponsored anti-Communist
cults, whose members believe sacred amulets protect them from bullets. [The
kevlar flak jackets from the Great Satan in DC probably help too.]

Handbills distributed by the cult, called the Reserved Manpower of the Good
Wisdom for All Nations, said deflating tires was, "God's way of stopping
bad deeds."

The handbills promised a new era of equality and social justice, including
a daily wage of $30 for everyone. <end quote>

This is certainly more innocuous than American cultists who argue the only
way to get social justice will be by putting Women, Lesbians, Gays and the
Bill of Rights to the torch.
