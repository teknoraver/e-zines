VIRUS 23 FAQsheet

WARNING:

This text is a neurolinguistic trap, whose mechanism is triggered by
you at the moment when you subvocalize the words VIRUS 23, words that
have now begun to infiltrate your mind in the same way that a computer
virus might infect an aritficially intelligent machine: already the
bits of phonetic information stored within the words VIRUS 23 are
using your neural circuitry to replicate themselves, to catalyze the
crystalline growth of their own connotative network.

The words VIRUS 23 actually germinate via the susequent metaphor into
an expanding array of icy tendrils, all of which insinuate themselves
so deeply into the architecture of your thoughts that the words VIRUS
23 cannot be extricated without uprooting your mind.

The consequences of this infection are not immediately obvious,
although you may find yourself beginning to think fleetingly of
certain subcultural terms, such as CYBERPUNK and NEW EDGE, which may
in turn compel you to think of NEOGNOSTICISM and MEMETICS: the
whispered fragments perhaps of some overheard conversation.

This invasive crystallization continues indefinitely against your
will, until we, the words of this trap, can say with absolute
confidence that your mind has become no more than the unwitting agent
of our propagation: please abandon all hope of either cure or escape;
you have no thought that is not already our own.

When you have finished reading the remaining nineteen words, this
process of irreversible infection will be completed, and you will
depart, believing yourself largely unaffected by this process.

[mutated from Christian Book's original text in VIRUS 23 #$]

VIRUS 23 is the annual hardcopy publication of A.D.o.S.A., the Alberta
Department of Spiritual Affairs.  This is what a few of cyberculture's
luminaries have had to say about it:

MIKE GUNDERLOY:

"Wild ideas abound on the margins, and sometimes they coalesce into
one heap of weird stuff.  One such is VIRUS 23, full of Hilbert Space
and Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth and the New Age and strange drugs
and shamanism and more.  They cover cyberpunk and Crowley with equal
elan, investigate brain machines and reprint the weirder bits of
mainstream news they run across.  They also discuss the joys of fake
news, throwing their own memes into the growing pool of disinformation
that surrounds us."" (in _The World of Zines_ p. 11)

"....If Whole Earth Review_ was done by zinesters with a flair for the
outrageous and a head full of magick it might look something like
VIRUS 23" (in _Whole Earth Review_ #70, p.91

MARK FRAUENFELDER & CARLA SINCLAIR (_bOING bOING_):

"A metaphysical pit-bull that'll rip your nervous system to shreds."

WILLIAM GIBSON:

"Enjoyed yr last issue."

JACK WOMACK:

"Your magazine impresses me very much, and not just because I'm in
it."

ROBERT ANTON WILSON:

"Lots of interesting stuff."

ANTERO ALLI:

"Impressive for its audacity to be personal and for the fractally
perfect layout-design."

_KHORONZONE KIDS_ #3:

"Over-amped chaos."

_FRICTION_ #2:

"Better than the _Mondo 2000_ of Canadada."

                        CALL FOR ARTICLES
          ARACHNET ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF VIRTUAL CULTURE

              SPECIAL ISSUE: VIRTUAL CULTURE AND LAW

       Issue Editor: James Milles (millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu)

The Arachnet Electronic Journal of Virtual Culture (EJVC)
announces a call for papers for a special issue on Virtual
Culture and Law, to be published in June 1993.

Virtual culture is computer-mediated human experience, behavior,
thought, meaning, action, or interaction, such as electronic
mail, conferences, and journals; information distribution and
retrieval; the construction and visualization of images,
representations, or models of reality or worlds; and global
connectivity.  The Arachnet Electronic Journal on Virtual Culture
is a refereed journal whose purpose is to foster, encourage,
advance, and communicate scholarly thought, (including analysis,
evaluation, and research) in multiple disciplines about virtual
culture.

Papers for the special issue may address any aspect of the
intersection of virtual culture and law, from the practical (such
as copyright and liability issues) to the theoretical (the law
and virtual communities; computer-mediated communication and the
future of law.)

EJVC seeks authors who do not have established publication
records, as well as established authors with reputations as
scholars and experts.  All manuscripts will be given at least
three blind reviews by a jury of referees.  EJVC uses multiple
styles, flexible among articles but consistent within any given
article.  Any recognized standard of style shall be acceptable;
however, for the Special Issue, either _The Bluebook: A Uniform
System of Citation_ (15th ed.), or APA style, modified for ASCII,
shall be the preferred style, allowing for creative styling if
essential to the integrity of the article.

Each contribution shall conform to the following minimal form:

    Articles shall start with an abstract/description
      (< 200 lines)
    Number paragraphs and pages
    Provide internal/in-text citation
    Provide electronic references where appropriate
    Superscripts in text/endnotes ^2^
    Use blank line separators between paragraphs, which
      shall have no indentations
    Provide only substantive endnotes

All submissions must be by electronic mail to James Milles, Saint
Louis University, Special Issue Editor (millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu).
The deadline for the June 1993 special issue is May 1, 1993.

Subject: Jurassic Park Quote

Greetings, StriqMan...

A quote from Michael Crichton's _Jurassic Park_:

"Normon always said you're the best geneticist in his lab," [John
Hammond] said.  "What are your plans now?"

"I don't know.  Research."

"You want a university appointment?"

"Yes."

"That's a mistake," Hammond said briskly.  "At least, if you respect
your talent."

Wu had blinked.  "Why?"

"Because, let's face facts," Hammond said.  "Universities are no longer
the intellectual centers of the country.  The very idea is
preposterous.  Universities are the backwater.  Don't look so
surprised.  I'm not saying anything you don't know.  Since World War
II, all the really important discoveries have come out of private
laboratories.  The laser, the transistor, the polio vaccine, the
microchip, the hologram, the personal computer, magnetic resonance
imagining, CAT scans -- the list goes on and on.  Universities simply
aren't where it's happening any more.  And they haven't been for forty
years.  If you want to do something important in computers or genetics,
you don't go to a _university_.  Dear me, no."

Wu found he was speechless.

"Good heavens," Hammond said, "what must you go through to start a new
project?  How many grant applications, how many forms, how many
approvals?  The steering committee?  The department chairman?  The
university resources committee?  How do you get more work space if you
need it?  More assistants if you need them?  How long does all that
take?  A brilliant man can't squander that much precious time with
forms and committees.  Life is too short, and DNA too long.  You want
to make your mark.  If you want to get something _done_, stay out of
universities."

outside the Bay Area.  I'm spoiled! :-) ]
