SONG IN YOUR HEART ISN'T ENOUGH?  TRY THE MUSICAL CONDOM

by Susan Q. Stranahan

Paul Lyons is a proud guy, a guy who had a dream, pursued it and
trumphed.

And while half of him wants the world to know of his
accomplishment, the other half's not so sure.

See, Paul Lyons also is a shy guy.  And his triumph came in
November when he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 5,163,447.

For a musical condom.

Or, as the patent reads, a "force-sensitive, sound-playing
condom."

With the exception of his brother, his attorney and a few close
friends, Lyons, of Southbridge, Mass., hasn't told anyone of his
invention.

"Even if I made a million dollars off it, I probably wouldn't
want to go around telling everyone I've succeeded in this area,"
he said the other day.  "It's enough just for me to know it."

Keeping the lid on his succes may prove somewhat diffficult.  His
name and address were published with the patent certificate.

He's already gotten calls from regular readers of the Patent
Official Gazette, the federal register of patents issued.

"Most of them were lawyers who wanted to know where they could
buy the condoms, " said Lyons.

Attention: Productions has yet to begin.  Lyons is still looking
for a manufacturer.  So don't loook for the condoms until summer
of fall -- at the very soonest.

That hasn't deterred some other eager entrepreneurs.

Lyons recently got a call from a company that -- for a price --
would reproduce a copy of his patent certificate, complete with
detailied diagram of the condom, on a lampshade.

He declined.

There's a part of Paul Lyons -- who politely declines to provide
his occupation or even his age -- that chafes at this
self-imposed anonymity.  He sees himself fulfilling the American
dream -- 1990's version -- of using his wits to get ahead.

"What does a person have if he doesn't have millions of
dollars?" he asked the other day.  "He has his ability and his
intelligence."

MOTHER OF INVENTION

"My motto is 'Find a need and fill it.'  THat's what I did," he
said.

Frankly, Lyons marvels that somebody hadn't already invened a
musical condom.

"It seems so simple," he said.  "I was sure somebody had already
done it."  Like other great inspirations, it grew out of a casual
conversation.

"A friend and I were talking about the recession and different
ways of making money," Lyons explained.  "I thought about it for
a few days and made a list.  The invention has to be something
inexpensive, something the majority of people can afford and
that the majority of people would find appealing in some way."

There were other considerations.

"You need something with a good amount of planned obsolescence,m
something that';s not going to last 100 years or so, something
that will have a quick turnover."

In other words, something like a condom -- an item people will
buy, use, throw away, and buy some more.

The musical condom -- he's still working on a jcatchy name --
wasn't Lyons' first invention idea.  He actually wanted to patent
small containers to house cladiolus bulbs to make them easier to
plant in the spring and remove each fall after blooming.

THree or four people already had that idea, he discovered.

Nobody, however, had thought of assembling a "miniature
piezo-electric sound transducer, a microchip which controls the
operation of (the) transducer, a powersupplying dry-cell battery
and a switch."

When pressure is applied to the rim of the condom containing the
tiny circuitry, the transducer emits "a predetermined melody, or
a voice message," according to the patent.  

FLEXIBLE TIMING

The patent continues: "The music or voice message may be played
once, or it may be repeated continuously for several minutes to
coincide with the duration of coitus.

"A voiced message may be a warning about safe sex, or a
compliment to the couple for using a condom.  Suitable melodies
-- if music is played -- may be `The 1812 Overture,' `Ode to
Joy,' ... or any popular love song."

Those are only suggestions, of course.  Lyons said the number of
condom tunes is mind-boggling.

"Once you start thinking, you can't stop," he said.

His attorney likes Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?"  Lyons
likes "Born To Be Wild."

It has taken Lyons several years to get this far in his quest to
produce the musical condom.  It hasn't been easy.

"What held me up for a long time was finding the musical
component," he said.  "You can't believe the phone bills I ran
up.  Finally, everyone said I had to go to the Orient to find it,
which I did not want to do.  I wanted to stay in America."

But one call to a Hong Kong trade association and Lyons had the
names of 10 Asian companies that could provide the tiny sound
unit, similar to the type used in audio greeting cards.

That wasn't the end, however.  Consider the matmter of volume.

"The speaker has to large enough and powerful enough to eb heard
over the, uh, background noise -- but not heard in the next
room," he said.

"And you have to look at liability.  The battery in it would be
so low in terms of producing current."

The, of course, there was the question of "prior art," as the
patent office refers to it.  That required extensive research to
prove that nobody else had laid claim to the musical condom.

The only apparent competition was an item in the 1990 Fredericks'
of Hollywood catalog called the "Wedding Surprise," which the
modest Lyons has difficulty describing in detail except to say
that it was a musical undergarment.

Patent examiners apparently checked the catalog and didn't regard
the item as a threat to Lyons' claim.

Lyons hopes his condom wwill sell for $3.50 to $5, and is
confident there is a market.

Date: Tue, 9 Feb 1993 23:23 EST

                                  PSYCHE

         an interdisciplinary journal of research on consciousness


     Psyche is a refereed electronic journal dedicated to supporting the
interdisplinary exploration of the nature of consciousness and its relation to
the brain.  Psyche publishes material relevant to that exploration from the
perspectives afforded by the disciplines of Cognitive Science, Philosophy,
Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Anthropology.
Interdisciplinary discussions are particularly encouraged.

     Psyche publishes a large variety of articles and reports for a diverse
academic audience four times per year. As an electronic journal, the usual
space limitations of print journals do not apply; however, the editors request
that potential authors do not attempt to abuse the medium. Psyche also
publishes a hardcopy version simultaneously with the electronic version. Long
articles published in the electronic version may be abbreviated, synopsized or
eliminated from the hardcopy version.

     The journal publishes from time to time all of the following varieties of
articles. Many of these (as indicated below) are peer reviewed; all of them
are reviewed by editorial staff.


	Research Articles___report original research by the author(s).
	Articles may be either purely theoretical or experimental or some
	combination of the two.  Articles of special interest occasionally
	will be followed by a selection of peer commentaries. Peer reviewed.

	Survey Articles___report the state of the art in some area(s) of
	research.  These may be done in the form of a literature review or
	annotated bibliography.  More ambitious surveys will be peer reviewed.

	Discussion Notes___critique previous research. Peer reviewed.

	Tutorials___introduce a subject area relevant to the study of
	consciousness to non-specialists.

	Letters___provide an informal forum for expressing opinions on
	editorial policy or upon material previously published in Psyche.
	Screened by the editorial staff.

	Abstracts___summarize the contents of recently published journal
	articles, books, and conference proceedings.

	Book Reviews___give an indication of the contents of recent books
	and evaluate their merits as contributions to research and/or as
	textbooks.

	Announcements___of forthcoming conferences, paper submission
	deadlines, etc.

	Advertisements___of immediate interest to our audience will be
	published: grants available; positions available; journal contents;
	proposals for joint research; etc.



                                Notes for authors

     Unsolicited submissions of original works within any of the above
categories are welcome. Prospective authors should send articles directly to
the executive editor. Submissions should be in a single copy of plain (ASCII)
text if submitted electronically or four (4) copies if submitted by mail.
Submitted matter should be preceded by: the author's name; address;
affiliation; telephone number; electronic mail address.  Any submission to be
peer reviewed should be preceded by a 100-200 word abstract as well.  Note
that peer review will be blind, meaning that the prefatory material will not
be made available to the referees. In the event that an article needs to be
shortened for publication in the print version of Psyche the author will be
responsible for making any alterations requested by the editors.

     Any figures required should be designed so as to be in screen-readable
ASCII. If that cannot be arranged, figures should be submitted as separate
postscript files so that they can be printed out by readers locally.

     Authors of accepted articles assign to Psyche the right to publish the
text both electronically and as printed matter and to make it available
permanently in an electronic archive. Authors will, however, retain copyright
to their articles and may republish them in any forum they want so long as
they clearly acknowledge Psyche as the orginal source of publication.


                                Subscriptions

     Subscriptions to the electronic version of Psyche may be initiated by
sending the "SUBSCRIBE PSYCHE-L Your Name" one-line command (without quotes)
in the body of an electronic mail message to LISTSERV@NKI.BITNET (or
LISTSERV%NKI.BITNET@cunyvm.cuny.edu). For general information on LISTSERV send
the command "INFO PR" or "INFO ?" Subscriptions to the print version may be
initiated by contacting the executive editor; a nominal fee will be required to
cover printing and mailing costs. 

                                Archival

     Electronic back issues of Psyche will be availabe by anonymous ftp at
(location to be determined).  Back issues of the print version are available
for a nominal fee from the executive editor.

                                Assistance

     Anyone who wishes to participate in the production of this
journal whether volunteering subject matter expertise or helping with layout
or proofreading please contact the executive editor.

the bandwidth of a fone line (and most voice signals) is about
4khz,  this corresponds to a "recording rate" (sampling rate) of
8000 samples/second.  Each sample is a full word,  probably 8 bits
(maybe 16 on mac?) wide.  The voice line uses a sampling frequency
of 8 kHz and 8 bit (companded) samples .  They also "throw-out"
a few bits here and there to use for other purposes (effectively
just adds some more noise to the channel).  I dont think the
samples on a mac are companded (amiga's samples are not).
Companding has the effect that the SNR of small signals will
be almost the same as the SNR for larger signals.  On an Amiga
you will have very poor SNR for small samples.  Best SNR is
achieved by using the full range of the digitizer on such systems.
At any rate,  8 bit non-companded will not sound nearly as good
as companded.

I would think that many people who hang out on technical
newsgroups would be very familiar with the anonymous review
procedures practiced by academic journals. There is some value
when a reviewer can speak their mind about a paper without
worry of revenge. Of course everyone assures me that the system is never
really anonymous because there are alwys only three or four people qualified
to review each paper. :-) 

Perhaps we should go out of our way to make anonymous, technical
comments about papers and ideas in the newsgroups to fascilitate
the development of an anonymous commenting culture in cypberspace.

Sounds like we need a new unit that specifically means "bits/sec" but
is easier to say. How about "Shannons", as in "I just bought a 14.4
kiloshannon modem". :-)
