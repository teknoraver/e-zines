Public Domain will be remembered for the annual Destroy All Music
Festivals in Atlanta in the mid-to-late eighties.  Since that time, as
noise has become "commercialized and set to a disco beat", Public
Domain has been migrating away from noise and into technology.  They're
not an easy organization to box into categories, so I hate to say much
more about them.  Email addresses are provided below -- write for more info.

PERFORATIONS usually includes a disk (Macintosh Hypercard, I think).
It's a real quality publication from Atlanta's most interesting
underground artists.  It's nicely produced, as in it takes time 
and attention, not as in commercial slime.  I like it!

And congratulations to Public Domain on their new node pd.org.  

                                                                --strick

WORKING PAPERS 5

This marks the fifth year that PUBLIC DOMAIN has provided an informal
forum for the presentation and discussion of ideas and arts for what has
been called the crises in representation (art), legitimation (politics),
and communication.  PUBLIC DOMAIN as an organization is devoted in both
theory and practice to examinations of the relationships between art and
ideas, and more specifically, the role that technology plays in constituting
modern life and thought.  To facilitate these explorations we conduct a
series of presentations called WORKING PAPERS several times a year, publish
a limited edition of the journal PERFORATIONS, and provide on-line computer
network services for PUBLIC DOMAIN members.

This Winter's series of WORKING PAPERS will be held at the Homage Coffee
House at 255 Trinity Ave. (near the Trinity gallery) in downtown Atlanta.
(Their phone number is 525-7546).  Each session will begin at 7:30 p.m. 
and last approximately one hour.  There will be an opportunity for 
discussion following each presentation.  Admission is free and open to the 
public.  We are however, a small, non-profit organization with limited 
funding, so we do accept and appreciate any and all contributions that you 
might care to make.....

February 8 / Michael Greer

                        WHERE POETRY HAS BEEN:
                     THE SPACE OF LANGUAGE WRITING

        Language poetry is artistic noise: it resists the dreams of pure
        communication, placing before us the heterogenous, ruptured,
        anti-subjective writing of the American tradition which extend
        forward from the poetics of Gertrude Stein. This tangent within
        contemporary North American poetry bridges gaps between theory
        (postmodern, poststructuralist, feminist), performance art (Cage,
        Mac Low, Antin), and the technological metadiscourses (Foucault,
        Baudrillard, Haraway) which fill the air.  It is aggressively and
        humorously political: is sets the ear on edge.  I will present a
        montage of textual exemplars, and offer a provisional account of
        this new writing's place in the postmodern scene.
