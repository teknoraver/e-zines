 INTRODUCTION
 
 Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the subcommittee 
 and guests, my name is Vinton G. Cerf and I am Vice 
 President of the non-profit Corporation for National Research 
 Initiatives (CNRI). I also have the honor to serve as President of 
 the Internet Society (ISOC), which is a professional society of 
 individuals who are users, developers or operators of the 
 Internet. My remarks today are personal in nature, but they 
 are colored by my past and present professional experiences 
 which form the backdrop against which my opinions and ob-
 servations have evolved.
 
 I worked on the ARPANET project while a graduate student at 
 UCLA in the early 1970s, helping to develop the protocols used 
 to support communication between the computers (hosts) on 
 the network. The highly successful ARPANET experience with 
 packet switching technology led to additional satellite, mobile 
 radio and local area packet networks, developed under  
 Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) sponsorship and, 
 in the case of Ethernet, at the Palo Alto Research Center of the 
 Xerox Corporation. Dr. Robert Kahn, now the president of 
 CNRI, initiated an ARPA internetting research program to ex-
 plore techniques to connect different packet networks in such 
 a way that the host computers did not have to know anything 
 about the intermediate networks linking them together. Dr. 
 Kahn and I developed the idea of gateways and wrote the first 
 specification for the basic TCP/IP protocols now used in the 
 Internet. 
 
 The idea behind Internet was the seamless linking of many 
 different kinds of packet switched networks. I came to ARPA in 
 1976 to manage the Internetting research program and by the 
 time I left ARPA in 1982, the TCP/IP protocols were widely 
 used and the Department of Defense had declared them stan-
 dards for military use. The Internet has blossomed in the sub-
 sequent 10 years, particularly after the National Science 
 Foundation (NSF) introduced the NSFNet as part of the 
 Internet in the mid-1980s. In 1982, there were about 100 
 computers  on the ARPANET and a few score others were part 
 of the NSF-sponsored CSNET which also used the Telenet  
 public data network. In 1993 there are over 1.5 million of 
 them. The system links over 10,000 networks in roughly 50 
 countries. Although it is not known for certain how many 
 users there are, we believe there are well over 5 million. The 
 system is tied into most public and many private electronic 
 messaging services and this expands the population able to 
 exchange email to some 15 million. They include business 
 people, academics, government workers, scientists, engineers, 
 librarians, schoolteachers, astronomers, oceanographers, biol-
 ogists, historians, reporters, attorneys, homemakers, and sec-
 ondary school students . 
 
 The system is doubling annually in users, networks, hosts and 
 traffic. In some parts of the Internet, such as the NSFNet 
 backbone, traffic growth rates as high as 15% per month have 
 been measured. Internet is growing faster than any other 
 telecommunications systems ever built, including the tele-
 phone network. Today, over half of the networks registered are 
 associated with business users. Of course, these rates of 
 growth cannot continue indefinitely, but there is reason to ex-
 pect that the user population will exceed 100M by 1998.
 
 Perhaps even more important, this federal investment in re-
 search has created new industries revolving at first around the 
 hardware and software of Internet technology, and more re-
 cently, around network and information services supported by 
 the Internet. The new businesses (such as Sun Microsystems, 
 3COM and Cisco Systems) have highly positive international 
 trade balances and phenomenal growth, commensurate with 
 the rapid growth of the Internet itself.  The growth rate is ex-
 tremely strong in Europe, South America and the Pacific Rim 
 creating major export markets for the US firms offering 
 Internet products and services.
 
 In 1975, operational management of the ARPANET was trans-
 ferred to the Defense Communication Agency (now the Defense 
 Information Systems Agency  - DISA). In the mid-80s, the 
 National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy 
 (DOE),  and the National Aeronautics and Space 
 Administration (NASA) joined in supporting the evolution of 
 the Internet and developing and applying its technologies. In 
 addition to developing their own networks (that became inte-
 gral components of the Internet), these agencies participated 
 in the development and standardization of the Internet proto-
 cols (TCP/IP Protocol Suite) and provided  support to the sec-
 retariats of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and Internet 
 Engineering and Research Task Forces (IETF and IRTF). This 
 included support for the Internet Assigned Number Authority  
 (IANA), document editor (RFC Editor), and Network 
 Information Centers which provide information and assistance 
 to users and deal with Internet network address assignments. 
 ARPA, NSF, DISA, DOE and NASA now make up part of the 
 Federal Networking Council which continues to oversee the 
 development of networks used in government-sponsored re-
 search and education.
 
 Formed at the beginning of 1992, the non-profit, professional 
 membership Internet Society  provides an institutional frame-
 work for carrying out a variety of activities intended to foster 
 the continued growth, evolution and application of the 
 Internet. Included in this undertaking is the responsibility for 
 the technical standards used in the Internet. Along with mem-
 bers of the Federal Networking Council, the Internet Society 
 supports the IETF Secretariat. It sponsors conferences and 
 workshops on the Internet and its technology, is establishing 
 liaison relationships with the International Telecommunication 
 Union (ITU) and Organization for International Standardization 
 (ISO), works with various United Nations agencies (e.g. UN 
 Development Program) to encourage the acquisition and use of 
 Internet facilities in technologically-emerging countries, and 
 participates in efforts to extend Internet services from univer-
 sity and research library communities to secondary school 
 systems. 
 
 The Internet Society does not operate any of the thousands of 
 networks that make up the Internet, but it assists service 
 providers by providing information to prospective users and 
 involves product developers and researchers in the evolution of 
 Internet technical standards. Corporate and individual, pro-
 fessional support for this organization is widespread and in-
 ternational in scope.
 
 
 High Performance Computing and Communication 
 
 The High Performance Computing  Act was signed into law late 
 in 1991. The original impetus for this legislation came from 
 then-Senator and now-Vice President Gore whose vision of 
 information superhighways limned the potential of a comput-
 ing and communications infrastructure which would permeate 
 and stimulate the government, business and private sectors of 
 the US economy. The promise of a vast new economic engine 
 equal to or larger than the engine sparked by the National 
 Highway Act of 1956 was a powerful incentive for this bill and 
 lies at the heart of the motivation for creating a new National 
 Information Infrastructure.
 
 One of the key elements of the HPC initiative is its National 
 Research and Education Network (NREN) program. Designed 
 to extend the performance envelope of networking into billion 
 bit per second  (gigabit) territory and to extend the scope of 
 access to a larger segment of the research and education 
 communities, the effort spawned a major research program on 
 gigabit networking. ARPA and NSF jointly funded an effort, or-
 ganized by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, to 
 establish multiple gigabit testbeds across the United States. 
 The program is highly leveraged, involving major contributions 
 from the computing and communications industries as well as 
 several of the national laboratories  and major research uni-
 versities . 
 
 An important focus of the gigabit testbed program is to dis-
 cover by experimentation which technologies and applications 
 are likely to form the core of the high performance communi-
 cation systems of the future. The deep involvement of industry 
 is intended, in part, to assure that the results take into ac-
 count the plans and capabilities of the private sector. Such 
 partnerships among government, industry and academic insti-
 tutions form a bedrock upon which new national infrastruc-
 ture can be founded.
 
 The vision of the NREN component of the HPC effort begins 
 with the existing US component of the global Internet. Under 
 the NREN program, key parts of the US Internet have been 
 extended to operate at 45 million bits per second (in particular 
 the NSFNet) and procurement of higher speed services by DOE 
 and NASA is in progress. The gigabit testbed program is en-
 abling the early availability of very high speed network tech-
 nology and the results of the program will help to determine 
 the architecture and technology of even higher capacity ser-
 vices. The NSFNet initiative, which began in 1986, has also led 
 to the creation of dozens of new Internet service providers, in-
 cluding a number of for-profit networks offering unrestricted 
 Internet service to all who desire it. 
 
 Another fundamental motivation for the high performance 
 networking component of HPC is the intense investment by the 
 principal interexchange and local exchange telecommunica-
 tions carriers in the US in the use of optical fiber in their net-
 works. Capable of supporting operation in the billions of bits 
 per second, the optical networks form the strands from which 
 a national gigabit fabric can be woven. Investments by local 
 exchange carriers and cable companies to increase the capac-
 ity of the lines reaching business and residential customers 
 make it possible to envision a time when very high capacity 
 services can be supported on an end-to-end basis.
 
 The far-sighted vision of the HPC effort, together with the ex-
 plosive growth of the Internet and basic communications fa-
 cilities resulting from private sector initiatives, have set the 
 stage for a dramatic new step in the evolution and convergence 
 of computing and communication: the creation of a National 
 Information Infrastructure.
 
 INFRASTRUCTURE
 
 Information Infrastructure is the Rcommon groundS on which 
 computer-based products and services depend to achieve 
 commonality and interoperability. Included in infrastructure 
 are technical standards and the organizations and procedures 
 through which they are developed; communication services 
 and the physical, human and organizational resources needed 
 to deploy, maintain and operate them; legal and regulatory 
 frameworks which encourage cooperative development of pre-
 competitive technology, foster the protection of computer-ac-
 cessible intellectual property, the protection of privacy, and 
 support the conduct of electronic commerce; widely available 
 computer software for many hardware and operating system 
 platforms establishing ubiquitous and interoperable comput-
 ing environments in which applications can be embedded. 
 Infrastructure supplies the raw material out of which limitless 
 applications may be constructed. 
 
 Some of the characteristics which mark elements of infrastruc-
 ture include: ubiquity, expandable capacity, simplicity of use, 
 applicability to many uses and broad affordability. A function-
 ing information infrastructure will lower technical and eco-
 nomic barriers to the introduction of computer-based products 
 and services. It will simplify the discovery and ordering of 
 products and services as well as billing for their use or acqui-
 sition. It will also facilitate the day-to-day operation of busi-
 nesses, government, education, health care and all the myriad 
 activities that rely increasingly on the use of computer and 
 communication technology to accomplish their objectives.
 
 Infrastructure has an enabling character. The highway system 
 enabled the suburban housing boom and convenient, door to 
 door delivery of goods. Of course, it also stimulated the auto-
 mobile industry and travel. The power generation and distri-
 bution system enabled the facile application of fractional 
 horsepower motors and a vast array of other electrical appli-
 ances wherever they were needed. 
 
 Infrastructure development is almost always preceded by criti-
 cal inventions which motivate the need for the infrastructure. 
 The light bulb preceded and motivated the need for power gen-
 eration and distribution. The invention of the internal com-
 bustion engine and its application in automobiles motivated 
 the need for better roads, service stations, gasoline refining 
 and distribution. Once the roads were in place, their ubiquity 
 and easy accessibility stimulated the production of a vast ar-
 ray of different vehicles, all designed to conform to certain 
 common constraints (size, height, weight) so as to be usable on 
 most of the roads in the system.
 
 The computer is the automobile of the information infrastruc-
 ture. Laptops are the sports cars; desktops are the sedans; 
 supercomputers are the formula 1 racing engines; and gigantic 
 mainframe data storagesystems are the 18 wheelers. The local 
 access networks form the neighborhood streets; high capacity 
 computer networks are the superhighways; and circuit, cell 
 and packet switching systems form the complex interchanges.
 
 Just as vehicles on the road can be filled with an endless 
 variety of people and products performing a multitude of 
 services, software applications fill the empty computing vessels 
 to create the new products and services of the information 
 infrastructure. Communication protocols and standards form 
 the rules of the road. When traffic jams and accidents occur, 
 we call on emergency services to assist. The same may prove 
 true for the information infrastructure when viruses  infect the 
 system or other software and/or hardware failures occur; we 
 will need comparable emergency assistance to restore critical 
 services and functions.
 
 The Electronic Frontier Foundation speaks of computers and 
 computer networking as a frontier in cyberspace. This is an 
 interesting and apt analogy, given the relative immaturity of 
 both technologies. Despite the apparent sophistication of to-
 dayUs computers, networks and software, their application has 
 barely scratched the surface of the latent possibilities. The no-
 tion of frontier raises images of boundaries and limits. But cy-
 berspace is a virtual place. It is created out of software, mak-
 ing cyberspace an endlessly expandable environment. 
 
 Information is, itself, an infinitely renewable resource to be 
 harvested, shaped, applied and recycled. The products and 
 services which can be built atop the computer and communi-
 cation infrastructure simply have no logical limits. It is this 
 ceaselessly changing, growing, transmuting information re-
 source which will fuel the economic engine of the information 
 infrastructure. 
 
 INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE FORMATION
 
 The technical challenges to be overcome in creating a national 
 information infrastructure may only be overshadowed by some 
 of the legal and policy problems. Taking the easier ones, first, 
 it should be apparent that standards for the exchange of a va-
 riety of types of information (data) are essential. The value of 
 infrastructure is that providers of two services which must in-
 terwork do not have to make bilateral agreements with every 
 partner if appropriate technical standards are developed which 
 enable such interworking. In the case of program (software) 
 interworking, common representations of shared information 
 must be agreed upon so that software developers can be 
 reasonably assured that, if they follow the protocols, their 
 application programs will interwork with each other.
 
 A variety of high and low-level standards are needed for 
 representation of digital documents; information retrieval 
 queries and responses;remote program interactions; financial 
 or other commercial transactions; privacy, integrity and 
 authenticity preservation; and a plethora of application-
 specific standards for information interchange. These 
 representations need to include the capability for a wide range 
 of media, including sound and pictures. There are a number of 
 representations available for encoding these various media, 
 but there is not yet widespread agreement on a common set. 
 Consequently, we are still some distance away from a workable 
 information infrastructure. 
 
 The applications that can be supported on a suitable 
 information infrastructure are limited only by imagination and 
 creativity. Examples include health care support (e.g., patient 
 information, prescription databases, digitized X-Rays and MRI 
 scans), remote consultation); education (classrooms without 
 walls, using the information infrastructure to receive 
 instruction, explore digital libraries and work with distant 
 partners), manufacturing, provision of government 
 information, and support for electronic commerce (e.g., order 
 entry, electronic or physical delivery of products, electronic 
 payments, product specifications).
 
 An important element of Internet growth is the typical pricing 
 strategy of service providers: flat rates based on the bandwidth 
 of the lines used to access the Internet. Unlike some 
 commercial email and other public data network service 
 providers, Internet service providers have not charged by the 
 Rpacket.S Many believe that this policy has had a major, 
 positive effect on the growth of the network because users had 
 little uncertainty with respect to annual costs for use of the 
 system. 
 
 ANECDOTES FROM THE 21ST CENTURY
 
 Those of us who have lived with the Internet since its inception 
 have been living in what will be common in the next century. 
 
 In preparation for this testimony, I sent a brief message out on 
 the Internet to hundreds of thousands of people who make 
 daily use of the network. I asked them to offer their thoughts 
 on points they considered important to make. Within hours, I 
 had thousands of responses, not just from domestic sources 
 but from all over the world. Without the infrastructure of the 
 Internet, such a question would not have been worth asking 
 since the answers would have taken far too long to receive, 
 and I could not have applied available computer cycles to sort 
 and sift the resulting responses. My correspondents were al-
 most uniformly enthusiastic about the prospects for national 
 and global information infrastructure. The following were some 
 of the points they made: 
 
 o	The Internet Society newsletter is created by correspondents 
 all over the globe who email their stories to the editors in 
 Los Angeles, California and Reston, Virginia. The whole 
 process takes places over a few days, with all the editing 
 taking place on-line. Each issue is available on-line within 
 minutes of completion through a variety of information 
 services on the Internet.
 
 o	A professor at the University of Southern Louisiana offered 
 to teach a class on Internet use through email on the 
 Internet. 15,000 people applied to take the class! This is 
 distance-learning with clout!!
 
 o	A blind student of Shakespeare asked on the net, where 
 can I get on-line copies of the plays, itUs the only convenient 
 way for me to read them. He uses a text-to-speech and 
 text-to-Braille device. He got back many pointers to on-line 
 archives around the world.
 
 o	When President Clinton and Vice President Gore were visit-
 ing Silicon Graphics in CaliforniaUs Silicon Valley, the audio 
 and video of the speeches were  packetized and multicast
 on the Internet to hundreds of participating sites. This is an 
 example of the nascent potential in combining all forms of 
 communication in computer-mediated form.
 
 o	Internet Talk Radio recently made the front page of the New 
 York Times - it is another example of the convergence of 
 digital computer communications and mass media.
 
 o	When I needed information about the Spratley Islands, I 
 just turned to the CIA World Fact Book made available on 
 the  Internet by the University of Minnesota.
 
 o	A technical problem arose with an application running on 
 an Apple Macintosh. The user sent an email message to 
 several distribution lists and news groups and got back 
 helpful responses, some in minutes, from France, Germany, 
 Italy, Australia, India, Singapore, Canada, England, 
 Norway, United States, Finland, ... well, you get the idea. 
 Cyberspace has common interest groups that transcend 
 national boundaries.
 
 o	The city of Wellington, New Zealand, has a computer on the 
 Internet. It has placed there a wide range of information of 
 interest to potential visitors and tourists, local residents, 
 and Internet explorers. There is strong historical evidence 
 that the rich personal interactions that take place on the 
 Internet contribute to a marked increase in face-to-face 
 meetings requiring travel, so the local government is to be 
 commended for its foresight.
 
 
 IMPORTANT THINGS THE US GOVERNMENT CAN DO
 
 Offered below is a representative set of comments and sugges-
 tions received over the course of a few days from the Internet 
 community. Because of its source, it has an obvious Internet 
 bias to it, but despite that, I think these ideas are worthy of 
 serious consideration.
 
 1. Invest in the development of pre-competitive software and 
 technology which is made available to industry for competitive 
 productizing. Historically, universities have developed sample 
 implementations of new Internet software which is then used 
 as the basis for product and service development in industry. 
 Occasionally, industry will sponsor development of freely 
 available software which can be readily distributed throughout 
 the network, creating a kind of mini-infrastructure on which 
 more elaborate, for-profit products and services may be based. 
 In both cases, new businesses are often created to service the 
 market created. 
 
 2. Foster and facilitate the development of technical informa-
 tion standards through cooperative efforts among industry, 
 academia and government. The procedures of the Internet 
 Engineering Task Force are a model for expeditious and 
 effective development because the standards must be im-
 plemented by multiple parties and shown to interoperate be-
 fore they are eligible for standardization.
 
 3. Revisit COCOM and US-specific policy on the application, 
 use, and export of the RSA and DES cryptographic technology. 
 Present policies inhibit the creation of particular aspects of 
 global information infrastructure and, in some cases, US 
 companies are placed at a severe disadvantage relative to 
 competitors. These technologies are key elements [no pun 
 intended] in solving problems of intellectual property protec-
 tion and management and  electronic commerce in an on-line 
 environment.
 
 4. Adopt the TCP/IP protocols as coequal with the OSI proto-
 cols in the US GOSIP specifications (which describe the profile 
 of protocols that are recommended for use in Government pro-
 curements). The TCP/IP protocols are already in wide-spread 
 use within the government, so this change would merely 
 acknowledge reality.
 
 5. Move aggressively to support library access to Internet ser-
 vices, with particular attention to rural community access.
 
 6. Institute training programs to educate the nationUs sec-
 ondary school teachers and support staff on the use of com-
 puter and communication technology in the classroom. 
 Subsidize access where this is necessary. Involve state educa-
 tional infrastructure in this effort. Review highly successful 
 state-level programs as input to national policy development.
 
 7. Stimulate the development of quality software for use in 
 curricula at all levels. Consider programs to develop pre-pro-
 duction software and make it available at no charge, leveraging 
 the creativity of national laboratories, universities and individ-
 uals. 
 
 8. Mandate public, on-line availability of government-produced 
 or sponsored information and allow the private sector to add 
 value and resell it. For example, the White House is providing 
 on-line access to unclassified executive orders and text of 
 speeches by senior administration officials within hours  (and 
 sometimes minutes) of their release.
 
 9. Foster programs to explore and experiment with the use of 
 information infrastructure to support telecommuting. Not only 
 as an energy-saving, pollution-reducing step, but a major tool 
 for implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act provi-
 sions. It was noted that home-employment and suburban 
 satellite offices illustrate that electronic communication infras-
 tructure is approaching the importance of the more concrete 
 (pun intended) traffic highways.
 
 10. Make use of the Internet to harvest information from its 
 tens of thousands of public databases as an adjunct to intelli-
 gence gathering and analysis by various agencies of the federal 
 government. Make available government unclassified 
 information and analysis via the Internet as a contribution to 
 the community (e.g. CIA World Fact Book).
 
 11. Get all branches of the government on electronic mail and 
 support the ability to exchange email with the public.
 
 12. Encourage the deployment of ISDN services. 
 
 13 Foster the development of shared scientific databases  and 
 collaboration tools which can be used to enhance the utility of 
 research results and provide access to raw as well as analyzed 
 data to support corroborating research. 
 
 14. Make use of the Internet to build bridges among the 
 scientific, research, academic and educational communities.
 
 15. Link the museums of the world on the Internet.
 
 16. Avoid the unintentional creation of a gap between 
 information rich and poor. The concern here is that private 
 sector entrepreneurship may conflict with freedom of access to 
 public information. Note that the potential gap problem applies 
 equally as well to individuals and to large and small cor-
 porations!
 
  17. Position national policy so that the government need not 
 subsidize network service providers. Rather, subsidize users, 
 where this is appropriate. By this means, remove most of the 
 Appropriate Use Policy dilemmas from consideration at the 
 network level. It is not technically possible today, using exist-
 ing capabilities, to distinguish different classes of traffic at the 
 network level. [There were a few people who thought the gov-
 ernment should build the National Information Infrastructure 
 but the vast majority who commented on this preferred private 
 sector service provision, albeit under government policies 
 which assure ubiquity of service, full interconnection of all 
 service providers and reasonable costs].
 
 18. Find a way to make advertising permissible and useful in 
 the National Information Infrastructure.

11 April 1993
The Honorable Timothy Valentine
Committee on Science, Space and Technology
Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation
House of Representatives
Rayburn House Office Building

Dear Chairman Valentine:

I recently had the honor of testifying before the 
Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and Aviation 
during which time Representative Rohrabacher (R, 
California) made the request that I prepare 
correspondence to the committee concerning the 
present US policy on the export of hardware and 
software implementing the Data Encryption Standard 
(DES) and the RSA Public Key encryption algorithm 
(RSA).

As you know, the DES was developed by the National 
Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in the 
mid-1970s, based on technology developed by 
Internatonal Business Machines (IBM). The details of 
the algorithm were made widely available to the 
public and considerable opportunity for public 
comment on the technology was offered. In the same 
general time period, two researchers at Stanford 
University (Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie) 
published a paper describing the possible existence 
of mathematical functions which, unlike the 
symmetric DES algorithm, could act in a special, 
pairwise fashion to support encryption and 
decryption. These so-called "public key algorithms" 
had the unusual property that one function would 
encrypt and the other decrypt -- differing from the 
symmetric DES in which a single function performs 
both operations. The public key system uses a pair 
of keys, one held private and the other made public. 
DES uses one key which is kept secret by all parties 
using it.

Three researchers at MIT (Rivest, Shamir and 
Adelman) discovered an algorithm which met Hellman 
and Diffie's criteria. This algorithm is now called 
"RSA" in reference to its inventors. The RSA 
technology was patented by Stanford and MIT and a 
company, Public Key Partners (PKP), created to 
manage licensing of the RSA technology. A company 
called RSA Data Security, Inc., was also formed, 
which licensed the technology from PKP and markets 
products to the public based on the technology.

The current policy of the United States places DES 
and RSA technology under export control. Because 
cryptography falls into the category of munitions, 
it is controlled not only by the Commerce Department 
but also by the State Department under the terms of 
the International Traffic in Arms regulations. 
Despite the public development of both of these 
technologies and their documented availability 
outside the United States over the last 15 years, US 
policy has been uniformly restrictive concerning 
export licensing. 

As the United States and the rest of the world enter 
more fully into the Information Age in which digital 
communications plays a critical role in the global 
infrastructure, the "digital signature" capability 
of public key cryptography is a critical necessity 
for validating business transactions and for 
identifying ownership of intellectual property 
expressed in digital electronic forms.

Registration and transfer of intellectual property 
rights in works which can be represented in digital 
form will be cenral factors in the national and 
global information infrastructure. A number of 
parties are exploring technical means for carrying 
out rights registration and transfer, making use of 
public key cryptography as a basic tool. 

In addition, there is a great deal of current work 
on electronic mail systems which support privacy by 
means of encryption and support authenticity by 
means of digital signatures. One of these systems, 
developed in the Internet environment I mentioned in 
my testimony, is called Privacy-enhanced Mail (PEM) 
and makes use of DES, RSA and some other special 
"hash" functions which are integral to the 
production of digital signatures.

For these various systems to be compatible on an 
international basis, it would be very helpful for 
the cryptographic components to be exportable on a 
world-wide basis. A number of vendors make produces 
relying on these technologies within the United 
States but often find it very difficult to engage in 
international commerce owing to the export licensing 
required for these technologies. Ironically, the 
technology appears to be widely available outside 
the US and also outside the COCOM countries, so US 
firms face both competition outside the US and 
export inhibitions in their attempts to develop 
worldwide markets.

There are  many valid national security reasons for 
limiting the export of cryptographic capabilities, 
since these technologies may aid an opponent in time 
of war or other conflict. Perhaps just as important, 
US intelligence gathering capability can be eroded 
by the availability of high grade cryptography on a 
worldwide basis. Recently, it has also been alleged 
that the world-wide availability of cryptography 
would also seriously impede US drug enforcement and 
anti-crime efforts. While these reasons seem 
sufficient, many have pointed out that the 
widespread accessibility to the detailed 
specifications of DES and RSA and availability and 
existence of software and hardware outside the US 
have long since done whatever damage is going to be 
done in respect of warfighting, crime or drug 
potential. This line of reasoning leads to the 
conclusion that our policies only inhibit legitimate 
commerce, but have little impact on the other 
concerns expressed.

As in all such controversy, there is often some 
truth on both sides. The National Institutes of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), has offered 
alternative digital signature capability. Technical 
assessments of the alternative have turned up 
weaknesses, in the opinions of some experts. There 
is not yet an alternative to DES, unless it is to be 
found in NSA's Commercial Crypto Evaluation Program 
(CCEP) in which NSA proposes to provide algorithms 
which are implemented in hardware by industry and 
made available for civilian use. As I understand 
this program, NSA does not intend to release any 
details of the algorithms, leaving open questions 
about the nature and strength of the technology. 
Some experts will persist in the belief that such 
offerings have weaknesses which are deliberately 
built in and hidden (so-called "Trojan Horses") 
which will allow the agency to "break" any messages 
protected by this means.

The critics complained loudly that the reasoning 
behind the design of certain parts of the DES 
algorithm (specifically the "S-boxes") was never 
made public and therefore that the algorithm was 
suspect. In fact, the DES has proven to be very 
strong - indeed, it may be that very fact which 
makes it so unpalatable in some quarters to permit 
its unrestricted export. It may be that the CCEP 
technology offered is satisfactory, but this is hard 
to tell without knowing more about its provenance. 

Presuming the wide availability of both DES and RSA 
technology, it seems to me appropriate and timely to 
re-examine US export control policy regarding these 
two algorithms. In all probability, any such review 
will require some classified testimony which will 
have to be heard in confidence by cleared members of 
your committee. I sincerely hope that the outcome 
will be favorable to use by US industry in 
international commerce, but even if the outcome 
results in continuation of present policy, it is 
timely to make such a review, in my opinion.

Sincerely,


Vinton G. Cerf
