Here I have finally listed the most frequent answers (and questions) I am
hearing on this side of the "surfpunk-request@osc.versant.com" mail alias.

My correspondents say things on lines that start "#%d".  I have perserved
the anonymity of most of these correspondents, since these things
are often scrapped from personal email.

Lines that don't start "#" are by me, and might contain facts.   --strick

#0  What is surfpunk about?

if it's new, if it's exciting, if it could only happen on the net.

#1 Here I am, sitting in hot bathwater, typing on the (dry) laptop,
#1 listening to a mix of _La Femme Nikita_ explosions, screams, and

were my electronic existance so exciting ....  the only time I saw
La Femme Nakita was Version Original with Danish subtitres, so if
you ever want to see it again, with some portion of it in english,
let me know.   I'd love to know waht it was about ..

me, i'm just sitting in my office, at the old sun4..

Methinks I can swing it, to run SLIP and an X server on my mac, and
be able to FUNCTION in a reasonablly electronik manner from my very
own hot bathwater, too.   Have to figure out how to do this ...


#1 How has life been with you?

went to 2600 meeting last night.  lots of People Of Handles are in town
for the big conference for Cypherpunks, Freemasons and Piracy next week -- 
both Emmanuel Goldstein and Phiber Optik were in from New York.
Bruce Sterling and a bunch are doing a thang tomorrow night, but alas,
I travel to Portland Oregon tomorrow, for the ANSI C++ standards meeting.

Really dissappointed to miss CFP.

#1 (paying) desktop on the planet..  A good move, demanded by their
#1 investors and government and corporate customers, terribly timed...

yeah, it does make sense.


#25 Subject: OK. Thrill me.
#25 
#25 Can I sample a few bytes of your juice?
#25 
#25 I'm trapped in Geneva with only an AT&T-Mail(TM) account (not even mine).
#25 Good friends in the middle-east sector fwd me some USENET stuff
#25 in order to ease my sensory-deprivation.
#25 
#25 Funny place. You do a mix or a video and people go:
#25 "How cute, it's a computer".
#25 MTV is the peak of futuristic activity here (they LOVE "Unplugged").
#25 Hurry! re-plug me before it's too late!


#75         Can you add me to the surfpunk list?  It sounds quite interesting...
#75 Also, when're you hitting Atlanta again?


#106 What the hell is _Et_Tu_Babe_?  Is it more of this
#106 stream-of-cabletelevision-channel-flipping crap?
#106 I've read matchbook covers of greater literary worth
#106 than this blender spew.
#106 
#106 That's the problem with you kids today -- no knowledge of the truth,
#106 and when you make a fiction, it's stupid and based on the 30second
#106 attention span.



#31         I think that you should consider the zen article in the SubG Digest
#31 I just sent you a contribution to the surfpunk.

food for thought, grounds for further research.


#1 230 NeXT people sent home, 100 of whom (all hardware people,
#1 interestingly enough) are now working at NeXT-investor and technology
#1 supplier Canon.  Just a few weeks later, many sales people are taken

aha!  cool.

#76 surfpunk is a smashing success/monster, eh?
#76 
#76 several folk i know want to subscribe ... would you rather i setup
#76 a local exploder and then i can subscribe them and not hassle you?

#105 And if I don't get my stapler back, i'm, i'm going to set the building
#105 on fire.  if they make me move my desk one, one more time, i'm going

#30 also have you tcl headers and files, but not sure how to get into them.  are
#30 they routines that i can call from c just as i call the toolbox??  any help in
#30 learning some tickle would be appreciated...

#35 what does MIME mean in the surfpunk mail I got.  it sounds like
#35 unfamilar slange or tech, but I'm not sure.
#35 
#35                 PS  Thanks for calling the travel dude(t).  L

#78 I would like to be on your subscription list.  What is a MIME?

MIME is Multipurpose Internet Mailer Extensions, or something
like that.  It's the new internet standard for embedding 
rich text, sound, bitmaps, etc. inside email.

#1 Strong rumors indicate that Canon will be making NeXT-type machines
#1 (including a PowerPC multiprocessor box, long awaited), Sun, DEC,
#1 SGI, and HP ports are in the works, NeXTSTEP for Intel Processors
#1 available for purchase now, shipping in May...

if nExt could ship decent software on NT, corporate america

me, i just got back from Bonzai Sushi in Redwood city.

Softshell crab maki (sushi roll), tempura shrimp maki,
Oregon Sea Urchin shuhi, and a salmonskin handroll (temaki),
and a large dose of sake.

#36 After a trip to the Koffee Kettle a few weeks ago, I've had
#36 this idea in the back of my mind.  I posted this to the git.humor

#34 Next on Geraldo:  Mutant surfpunks and the seals who love them...

#77 I found out about you because I am a Editor(punkcyberish) of a Electro-
#77 zine in colorado. You or a member of u sent us mail asking to be on
#77 the subscription list....we added you and soon that account will
#77 be sending the stuff you wanted. In the mean time I had a
#77 question.....could you kindly tell me more about what u are?

if it's new, if it's exciting, if it could only happen on the net.

#2 Hiya. Haven't gotten anything from Surfpunk, or Stupid in the past two weeks
#2 or so....I remember seeing SP#55, I think. Just wondering if you thought I
#2 wanted off, or if something got screwed up, cuz I'm still interested :>

#2 still stuck in FL, and a tad overdosed on caffeine.

#179 Could you tell me please, what 'Xanalogical Archive access soon' means ?

good question, actually.

to me, it means someday I hope to have not only SURFPUNK archives but
also the sources for SURFPUNK available via gopher, www, tk-www,
prospero, ftp, etc.

The name 'Xanalogical' comes from the Xanadu project, the single most
audacious plan for the electronic dissemination of literary texts in
all of recorded history ...     I'm trying to remember the name of the
book by Ted Nelson ... Literary Machines, I think.  I loaned my copy
out ...

#179 Thanx in advance.

I had hoped to have all this running by now, so I wouldn't have to
explain ...




#4 I now have clearance to distribute RIPEM.
#4 I am going to take one more day or so to retest RIPEM before
#4 releasing it.  I'd appreciate your help.


#40 Is anyone compiling a list of famous Scott McNealy quotes?


#41 Ian Smith recently sent me an excerpt from your esteemed journal --
#41 please add me to the dl.
#41 Back issues?

Jawohl.  It's young, so there's not too many to just email you.

The full intentions of SURFPUNK are not fully revealed yet;
I am working on a better MANIFESTO.

#707 We have produced a cassette tape of tones that feel good when played
#707 into genital electrodes.  If there is enough interest, we will find
#707 a way to make it available.


#79 Please add me to your dangerous 'zinelist!


#53 I saw your posting about SST, U2, Negativeland etc.
#53 Do you know if it's possible to get a copy of the tape from somewhere?

#80 Good luck with the multimedia stuff; you may end up leaving me 
#80 (and my antique Apollo running Aegis) behind in the dust...

#94   I just read John Perry Barlow's perceptive remarks to the First
#94   International Symposium on National Security & National Competitiveness
#94   which you distributed. His statement -- "The problem is that the
#94   difference between data and information is meaning, something machines
#94   know little of. To determine whether data are meaningful, whether they
#94   are, in fact, information, you must pass them through a human mind" --
#94   couldn't more true. I certainly hope that those of us who passionately
#94   believe that (simplistically stated) our National Competitiveness is
#94   equal to our ability to turn data into usable information and TAKE
#94   ACTION appropriately can convince others of the same.



#97 I just finished reading a forwarded copy of Clinton's speech at SGI,

#97 originated this release.

#97 mentioned throughout the speech I would love a copy of that.

#98         I saw some information on your journal on Dead-Flames and was
#98          interested in checking it out. Could I be added to the mail list?

#44 God, but that was great.


#10 what does Xanalogical mean?

Mona did give my "literate machines" back, but it's at home, so I cannot
site from the scripture.

Just as Xerox protects "Xerox" as a trademark, but allows "xerographical"
to be used as a nontrademarked work, the Xanadu project keeps "Xanadu"
as a trademark, but allows "xanalogical" as a common word for 
an electronic literary document server.

It's just a fancy way of saying I intend to make surfpunks, as well as the
source documents for surfpunks, available for access via a email server,
ftp, www, tk-www, gopher, etc.   Actually I intended to do it in January.

Use "strick@osc.versant.com".  It's fast, easy, reliable, and
is the only EMAIL address with a 24 hour registered nurse to

family physician.



#55 I caught your stuff on FutureCulture re: negativland, and yer list
#55 looks good -- so: any chance of subscription?

#102 I'd like to obtain a virtual subscription to spin and punk, (as in
#102 surf) -- is this the right neighbourhood?
#102 RSVP --> I'm an impatient bastard, if that''s all right with you.



#45 | May I ask -- how'd you hear about SURFPUNK?
#45 
#45 Some guy posted the xmas program which printed the lyrics to Twelve
#45 Days of Christmas.  I saw the address at the end.
#45 
#45 It was quite an interesting program...


#29 How about providing a transcription of all the titles of past SPJ's, for
#29 those of us whose mailers don't do rot.13 (or whatever it is) and are too
#29 lazy to do it themselves? <grin>

#39         I'd be interested in seeing some kind of formal proposal for
#39 this project of yours, including why you choose to call it SURFPUNK.
#39 I know there's got to be a story behind that one.


It's like a whole bunch of puns.  There was a band in the late 70s
early 80s, the surfpunks.  They combined surf music with punk culture,
which were diametric opposites in los angelos youth culture at that
time.  it was a joke.  most punkers back then got it.  then surfing and
[cyber]punk both have their literary and media and internet meanings.
and it makes us sound killer k-rad so everybody subscribes so what the fuq.

The first part of the SURFPUNK project is simply a mailing list called
SURFPUNK Technical Journal, that leans toward the "new edge" of
cyberpunk and cyberspace.  My ultimate intentions for the project have
not yet been revealed.

#67 Please subscribe me to SURFPUNK. It looks interesting.  Great name,

#68 I assume (perhaps presumptively) that this is a moderator/publisher
#68 and not a listserv.  Greetings, fellow inhabitant(s) of cyberspace.
#68 I'd really love to subscribe to your zine.

#70 ATTN: I have a fast approaching press deadline so please do not delay
#70 in returning the desired information or your e-serial will not be
#70 mentioned in the forthcoming revision of the _Directory of Electronic
#70 Journals and Newsletters_.

#71 Handbook. There will be a large zine section; if you're interested in
#71 sending me a couple of recent issues I'd like to see it for a possible
#71 review. The book is scheduled for release this fall. My snail mail addess

#72 It's been a while since we've seen each other.  I'm doing well; I'll get
#72 my Masters in about a month, on them I'm on the lam.


#73 subscribe 
#73 And in case this isn't automated:
#73 I saw this mentioned on the ARACHNET mailing list.  Which is
#73 surprising since the list is usually quite anal and uninteresting.

#74 Could you send me a recent issue or posting so I can classify you e-serial?






#19        Note that this proposal does NOT prevent any given implementation
#19        from ACTUALLY returning a completely instantiated collection; it
#19        simply requires that the returned "value" be an iterator.


#46         Yesyesyesyesyes!  Keep me on the mailing list for Surfpunk.  I had used
#46 up all of my accounts allocation, so I didn't get _any_ of it until tonight.
#46 Serious kudos to you, my friend, for Surfpunk.  I love it!



#12 It should be good fodder for alt.alien.visitors...I'm gonna post it there and
#12 also mail it to John_-_Winston, the overlord nut of that newsgroup.

#13 Went to Junior's today with three other 'Niquers.  Got some free (warm)
#13 cookies.  I love Junior's.  Welp, I'm outta here, gotta do some laundry (in
#13 the rain even.  Perhaps drying my clothes would be a fruitless effort).




#14 I just submitted my UUCP map today for registering ahpook.atl.ga.us.
#14 I'll let you know when it's safe to send me mail using the
#14 chris@ahpook.atl.ga.us address.   When it is, could you switch
#14 all your mailing list addresses for me?  I'd much rather read
#14 that stuff at home.

#56 The article about Negativland is c00l! (that about 'L'ISLE DE GILLIGAN'
#56 is too hard for me .. :-)

#57 Sent you a message yesterday & hope to hear from you soon.
#57 Otherwise - see you in the matrix -



#20         I got this EMail address from Karl. Hope its the right one.  I went
#20 searching the net for you a few nights ago and hit the wrong strick... some
#20 guy in austin, tx.  I miss you.  I think about you a lot.  Please write
#20 back and tell me whassup!

#47 HELP!! I'm looking for a way to get NEWS without having a NEWSSERVER on
#47 campus.  I want to subscribe to some stuff, but we won't get a newserver
#47 for years, I'm afraid.  Any suggestions?


#24 you can go to billboard companies, like
#24  Gannet in Berkeley, and ask for "dead paper",
#24  and get unused billboard sheets with pictures on.
#24  Someone at Armpit Gallery in SF told me this,
#24 she was doing poetic terrorism on billboards
#24 and had a show there about it.



#125 Hey Strick, Long time no Stupid...
#125 
#125 I'm actually in Poland now, with my Honey, and I just got your stupid about the
#125 "Let's Ban Heteros..."  That was a good one.
#125 
#125 Anyway, I'm here, just kind of soaking in culture (tea, pollution, bread and
#125 cheese) and having a great time.  I actually just got back from the Mountains,
#125 which were a beautiful (and much needed) break from the local scenary.  Lots
#125 of snow and trees and clean air.  We even crossed (illegally) into Slovakia for
#125 a couple steps, just for the hell of it.
#125 
#125 Now, it's back to the ol' town, Krakow, for a couple weeks at least, then I
#125 believe we're starting our little Western Europe Jaunt.  Berlin, Prague, Vienna
#125 and maybe Salsburg.
#125 
#125 Here's what's new and unusual in Poland:
#125 
#125 Abortion is now Illegal.
#125 All TV and radio broadcasts are subject to approval by the Christian Values
#125         Committee.
#125 Trash is incinerated in trucks right on your doorstep  (On site incineration!)
#125 And, 7 skinheads go on trial for beating up (and killing) a German truckdriver.
#125 
#125 Wheeee!
#125 
#125 Enlightened neighborhood, yes?


#126 Strick:
#126 
#126     Thanks. I feel so loved that people send me mail...I need to get a life,
#126 Huh? See ya soon.



#32 Greetings, Striq!  :)

#123 Robert has left (dramatic sigh), but he may now be suitably

BTW, go out and buy SNOW CRASH by Neal Stephenson.  It's only $10.  Or
beg for it at your favorite bookstore.  Wrap it up, and say it's from
strick.  open it.  Carry it around as an elite status symbol.

#124 SnowCrash is most excellent.  at pg 185, and it just gets better and

#49         It seems to me, especially after reading your SURFPUNK issues,
#49 that you would be a supporter of ushering in those things which

#116 Frobnicate, v.: To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from
#116 FROBNITZ.  Usually abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to
#116 frob a frob".  See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK
#116 sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless
#116 manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse
#116 search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is
#116 turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
#116 he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
#116 screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because
#116 turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.



#117 Spaf has been travelling recently.  As a result, he has hundreds of
#117 queued-up meesages in his mailbox to be answered.
#117 Thus, your message to him entitled "alt.sex.bondage"

#117 to be patient.


#117 Spaf is overloaded, overworked, and probably underpaid.  As a result
#117 of the first two, plus some after-effects of travel, he has hundreds
#117 of queued-up messages in his mailbox to be answered.  Thus, your
#117 message to him entitled "(n@Nd0) Re: electronic self-stimulation"
#117 has been received, but it may be a while before he can respond.  Try
#117 to be patient.


#118 The moons are in alignment and the core memory is all clicking without
#118 sticking, which means I can finally send you mail.
#118 I'm interested in lending a hand in the Surfpunk Technical Journal.


#50 pweez pweez pud me on da maiwing wist.
#50 sank oo bewwy much.


#51 I know this won't be of much help, but I forwarded your original
#51 message (Negativland's Christmas Newsletter 1992) to a guy I know who
#51 has been writing for the norwegian (anarchist)magazine; GATEAVISA.
#51 This should be of interest for them, since they have printed a few
#51 articles on the question of copyright in the past years.


#58 I do (both!)  I'm one of his Response Center Analysts... He's
#58 forwarded some stuff from surfpunk to us, and I thought I'd check out
#58 the whole thing...

Here am I in the new 706 zone (coming soon to a phone book near you)


#59 Hiya.  I'd like a subscription.  I'm supposed to administrate networks and
#59 stuff.  But I read lots of mail, instead.


#60 Yah, I've the distinct honor of knowing JPD.  Not only do I call him "jpd",
#60 but, upon occasion, I call him "Dude" or "Mr. Draughon".



#15 ># Strick,
#15 >#
#15 ># there's eap big information available on the internet.

#15 >You probably know about gopher and www and wais and archie.
#15 
#15 Got gopher, understand how it works pretty well.
#15 What's this about "GOPHER +"? Just new & improved for the '90's?
#15 
#15 Never heard of "www"
#15 
#15 Can't find a decent Mac WAIS client.
#15 As I understand it, WAIS could be better, and has a huge TCP/IP overhead.
#15 Any comment? or am i mistaken?
#15 
#15 Got archie.


Georgia Tech subscribes to USA Today.  There are other "news hierarchies"
that you can pay for.  Clarinet is another one.  Sometimes there's some
good info in there, but usually the NYTimes is a lot easier to read.


#16 Did you get my last message on Summer Jobs?
#16 
#16 I realy need one and thought you might have an opening for a cheap worker...

#17 I've checked in a bunch of files to fix some bugs.  This fixes the criteria
#17 for freeing and refreshing objects, so it should work in all cases.  It also
#17 puts in an optimization so things will get freed when you expect, in flat

#61 Does this list come in regular ol' one-post-at-a-time format?  (I'm using
#61 procmail and wouldn't have to undigestify)  If not, no big deal.



#1  PS - Tell me more about TAZs !!!  I think this could take root

#62 My ignorance is my own fault.  :}

#63 Yupe.  Mainz is in Germany...

#64 How does one view the "new_year.gif" that was provided at the end
#64 of issue 38?  Is it simply a cut and paste to file and then to be
#64 viewed with a program that can display gifs?

Assuming you are on unix:

save your mail to a temporary file.  Don't know your mailer does it, perhaps

        s tempfile

Then, after you exit your mailer, type this:

        uudecode < tempfile

The "uudecode" program will look for the line that starts with begin:

        begin 644 new_year.gif

It will get the filename "new_year.gif" from there and create the
file.  ( The 644 is the unix file mode, meaning "-rw-r--r--", if
you do "ls -l new_year.gif"  (you can read and write, others only read) )

Anyway, after you do the "uudecode" command, you should be able to
do a "ls" and see the "new_year.gif" file.  Now you need a giffer,
and you need to be on a machine with graphics.  Ask one of the
Useless Assistents, perhaps.   If you are on a SUN running A
Window System Named X, you can try the "xv" or "xview" command

        xv new_year.gif

and it might work.  This also might work:

        giftoppm < new_year.gif | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtoxwd | xwud

#39  If you throw a New Year's Party, the worst thing that you can do would
#39 be to throw the kind of party where your guests wake up today, and call
#39 you to say they had a nice time.  Now you'll be be expected to throw
#39 another party next year.
#39 
#39 What you should do is throw the kind of party where your guest wake up
#39 several days from now and call their lawyers to find out if they've
#39 been indicted for anything.  You want your guests to be so anxious to
#39 avoid a recurrence of your party that they immediately start planning
#39 parties of their own, a year in advance, just to prevent you from
#39 having another one ...
#39 
#39 If your party is successful, the police will knock on your door, unless
#39 your party is very successful in which case they will lob tear gas
#39 through your living room window.  As host, your job is to make sure
#39 that they don't arrest anybody.  Or if they're dead set on arresting
#39 someone, your job is to make sure it isn't you ...


#65 If "Surfpunk Technical Journal" ends up being a Mac-specific FTP type of thing,
#65 I would still have fun with it--I have access to plenty of Macs and hope to own
#65 one soon--If it's something palpable from my Amiga--all the better!!  I would
#65 very much like to subscribe --if free-- to this fine e-publication --why not?!


#66 Saw your magazine notice on FringeWare mailing list; I'm interested!
#66 Please send a copy (it is an e-mag, right?).
