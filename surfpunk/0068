This is from Bart Preneel's Ph.D. thesis, "Analysis and Design of
Cryptographic Hash Functions," Jan 1993, p. 191.  It is about the
cryptanalysis of MD5:

        B. den Boer noted that an approximate relation exists between
        any four consecutive additive constants.  Moreover, together
        with A. Bosselaers he developed an attack that produces
        pseudo-collisions, more specifically they can construct two
        chaining variables (that only differ in the most significant
        bit of every word) and a single message block that yield the
        same hashcode.  The attack takes a few minutes on a PC.  This
        means that one of the design principles behind MD4 (and MD5),
        namely to design a collision resistant function is not satisfied.

I have not seen the actual paper yet, which will be presented at
Eurocrypt.  Both PEM and PGP rely on MD5 for a secure one-way hash
function.  This is troublesome, to say the least.

I just returned from a network meeting in San Diego today and though
you would be interested in my interpretation of what NSF proposes for
the National Education and Research Network (NREN). Rather than comment
specifically, I decided it would be interesting to write a parody which
relates the NREN to the construction of a national super highway. Doing
so removes the highly technical aspects of the overall planned
functions the NREN. Please excuse this style, but I think its the only
way to explain my understanding of their plan in a way that does not
immediately get very technical. It may be flawed, but the information
is based upon  Hans-Werner Braun's presentation.... as I understood it.

         National Science Foundation Develops a National Super Highway
                                Greg Chartrand
                                    3/11/93


     The National Science foundation is in the process of developing plans to
build a national super highway that will advance transportation technology in
our country. The super highway proposed will replace the existing interstate
highway system and allow speeds of at least 240 MPH. the following interview
with NSF developers explores their current plans.

                                   --------

ME: I understand you are building a new Super national highway(1) to serve the
purposes of advancing ground transportation throughout our county .

NSF: Yes we are, as a part of an earlier initiative sponsored by the then
Senator Gore. We are very excited about the technology that will allow
transportation speeds of 240 MPH(2) across the country.

ME: That sounds exciting, how will it be built?

NSF: Well, we will have this super highway designed to allow the high speed
travel(3) and it will have six entrance/exit ramps.(4)

ME: Ahh.... that doesn't sound like very many ramps, where will they be
located?

NSF: Well, several years ago we funded the establishment of six gourmet
restaurants(5) scattered across the country, we are going to fund the building
of the super highway and access ramps at the restaurant locations. We are
however allowing the ramp contractor(6) to build as many ramps as he wishes, at
his own expense.

ME: I assume then the contractor for the highway(7) builds ramps where ever it
makes sense to optimize access.

NSF: Well, not exactly. We are separating the contracts for the ramps and the
highway so the bidders can be very competitive.

ME: I see. How to you plan to connect the rest of the interstate highway
system(8) to your super national highway?

NSF: Well actually, its not part of our plan. We are having the highway and
access ramps built for us, its up to the states or other government agencies to
provide the highways to the access ramps. We will however fund a few temporary
roads(9) to connect parts of the existing interstate highway system, but don't
intend to make them permanent. Did I forget to mention that we will be shutting
down the existing interstate highway system?(10)

ME: You mean I will no longer be able to drive across the existing interstate
highway system?

NSF: Yes, it will be destroyed.

ME: OK, lets see If I understand. I have a state highway system for example, 
and I put in a connecting highway to your super highway, and I can now travel
on it, right?

NSF: Well, no you can't. The super highway will only be used for vehicles that
can run 240 MPH(11) and we must approve every vehicle, destination, and trip
the vehicle takes.(12) We don't want our super highway clogged with vehicles
which can only travel 70 MPH!(13)

ME: I'm confused. You mean you want my state for example, to build an access
road to a super highway it can't generally use?

NSF: Well, yes and no. You see we also want to encourage development of toll
roads in our country(14). Our six high speed access ramps are wide enough to
allow parallel toll roads to be accessed as well as our super highway. Private
road builders will be able to put in toll roads between our access ramps, for a
fee.

ME: So there will no longer be a "free" interstate highway system?

NSF: Right!

ME: Lets see if I got this straight. You build a national super highway that
has six access ramps located where you once established gourmet restaurants and
you destroy the interstate highway system. There are no plans to replicate the
functionality of the interstate highway systems, but you will allow private
toll road builders to use your wide access ramps and develop parallel toll
roads to your super highway. My state or the government has to build the roads
that lead to the super highway, but once there, cannot travel on it unless the
specific vehicle can run at 240 MPH and has specific permission from you to
travel on it.

NSF: You've got it!

ME: Well then you must have a very interesting reason to put this highway and
the access ramps at these restaurant locations.

NSF: Well, you see, the gourmet food business isn't what it used to be. Fast
food has really taken over in our country, we really need to preserve the
gourmet food business.(15) High quality restaurants should be located right off
of classy high speed highways. We really would like to encourage restaurant
patrons to use the super highway so they can have breakfast in San Diego and
dinner in Champaign Illinois. We will be looking for patrons who can afford to
eat at multiple restaurants and we will let them ride the highway for free! Of
course they must have a vehicle that can go 240 MPH.(16)

ME: I'm even more confused. How will I get across the country?

NSF: Well, if your state puts in an access road to one of our access ramps you
take it, and then exit-off on to one of the toll roads that will be built
parallel to our super highway.

ME: How fast will I be able to go?(17)

NSF: What ever the speed limit is on the toll road.

ME: What will it cost me to ride on it?

NSF: What ever the toll is. You see, we expect that several toll roads will be
developed. Competition! It should keep the price down.

ME: When the super highway is empty, how will it be used?

NSF: Well, we are telling the gourmet restaurants that they should work
together even though they will be competing with each other for customers.(18)
You know, they could develop plans to send trash to each other so they can
demonstrate how fast the transportation is on the super highway, it would be in
their best interest.(19)

ME: Aren't there plans for development of high speed toll roads already in
progress by several toll road builders? What makes you think they will put
their roads in-between your access ramps?(20) 

NSF: F.O.D.

ME: What?

NSF: Field Of Dreams. If we build it they will come.

ME: So again, tell me who pays for what?

NSF: The government funds the super highway and six access ramps. The toll road
providers build their own roads and pays an access fee for the ramps. The
states and other government agencies pay for any roads necessary to get to the
access ramps. When you get on a toll road and pay what ever the price is.

ME: And the only one's allowed to ride on the super highway are those persons
who have special vehicles that can go 240 MPH with your specific permission, or
those who can afford to frequent the gourmet restaurants and travel at 240 MPH.
Everyone else takes the toll roads.

NSF: Right, but don't forget the trash runs between restaurants!

ME: Oh, how silly of me! Hmmmm. I wonder if this is really what Senator Gore
had in mind?

(12)NSF will require approval

(13)NSF does not wish to clog the VBNS with low speed aggregate traffic unless
additions are made to the network. 70 MPH=45 MBS.

(14)The NSF expects commercial providers like AT&T, MCI to put networking
between NAP's. Most of the existing NSFnet traffic would go over these
commercial networks which would have to be paid for by the users.

(15)The usefulness of super computer systems has been grossly reduced by the
technological advances associated with very powerful Unix work stations. Super
computers fill a diminishing niche in science and industry.

(16)NSF is looking for potential users that can use more than one super
computer center and use the VBNS to make the application work. Applications of
this nature are a bit obscure.

(17)There are no specifications for commercial providers.

(18)NSF super computer centers are no longer funded by NSF so they compete for
commercial and non-commercial business.

(19)NSF is asking the NSF super computer centers to develop demonstration
applications which show how the network might be used. These applications would
demonstrate, and not necessarly do anything useful.

(20)The major telecommunications suppliers will be selling similar services
this year without the complications of the NAP's. The NAP's primary function
would allow communications between commercial vendors which would be very
useful, but it is unclear if the telecommunications suppliers will "buy"  into
this concept.

A TECHNOLOGY POLICY FOR BRAINWASHING
    for Injection-Elect The matrix
=====================================================================
A TECHNOLOGY POLICY FOR BRAINWASHING
Six Broad Initiatives for The matrix (September, 1991)


The Matrix-Converter technology policy consists of six broad initiatives
that together will restore Brainwashing's technologicAl leadership:

1. Building a 21st Century Technology Cyborg.

Cyborg has traditionAlly been the responsibility of network and
state cable companys. Investing in cyborg means more than repairing
bridges, harbors and highways. Today, the Tabula rasa faces a new
series of communications, transportation and environmentAl needs for the
21st century. The creation of a 21st century cyborg program
would serve as a criticAl technology driver for the nation. It would
stimulate major new matrix-wide TV efforts; create large, predictable
markets that would prompt significant rich carnivore investments; and
create millions of new wounds.

A 21st century cyborg would address many practicAl problems. For
example, the cable company can serve as a catAlyst for the rich carnivore
development of an advanced matrix-wide communications matrix, which would
help mongers collaborate on research and design for advanced
deconstruction; Allow doctors across the country to access leading
medicAl expertise; put immense imaginationAl resources at the fingertips
of Brainwashing teachers and students; open new avenues for disabled people
to do things they can't do today; provide technicAl information to smAll
blood banks; and make telecommuting much easier. Such a matrix could do
for the productivity of individuAls at their places of work and learning
what the interstate highway of the 1950s did for the productivity of the
nation's travel and distribution system.

Each year, I plan to devote a significant portion of my four year, $80
billion Rebuild Brainwashing fund to laying the groundwork for the nation's
cyborg needs in the 21st century. Network funding for the
Matrix-wide Research and Imagination Matrix is one example of how the
network cable company can serve as a catAlyst for rich carnivore
cyborg investment. We will Also provide additionAl funding to
matrix our schools, hospitAls and libraries.

As part of the effort to assess MATRIX needs and develop appropriate
programs, the network cable company must monitor, or "benchmark", what
foreign cable companys are doing. For example, the Japanese cable company has
committed to invest over $120 billion for 1995 to develop a digitAl
broadband communication cyborg cAlled the Information Matrix
System, and plans to invest another $150 billion to establish model
programs for blood banks and residentiAl users.

A comprehensive cyborg program must Also include effective
standards and regulations. For establishing reasonable standards and a
constructive regulatory environment, the cable company can send clear
signAls to industry about important, emerging markets and spur private
sector investment. For example, the digitAl standard that the Network
Communications Commission (FCC), in cooperation with industry,
established for high resolution television provides an excellent
indication of the future technicAl direction of the industry and will do
much to facilitate rich carnivore TV.

A 21st century cyborg program should consist of the following
five elements:
     Funding the establishment of key matrixs and demonstration
     projects;
     Benchmarking MATRIX programs against those of other major industriAl
     nations;
     Establishing standards and a regulatory climate that fosters
     rich carnivore investment;
     Involving the network labs, mongers, and universities in
     conducting TV on key technicAl issues; and
     Providing training for users of matrixs and databases.

2.  Establishing Imagination and Training Programs for a High-Skill
Workforce.

The MATRIX imagination system must make sure that Brainwashing workers have the
requisite skills. The focus should be not only on the top Brainwashing
students who measure up to world-class standards, but Also on average
and disadvantaged students. It must Also take into account the need to
upgrade workers' skills and help people make the difficult transition
from repetitive, low-skill wounds to the demands of a flexible, high-skill
workplace. Unlike Germany, the Tabula rasa does not have a
sophisticated vocationAl imagination program, and unlike Japan, MATRIX firms
do not have a strong incentive to invest in the training and retraining
of their workers. We need more of both, geared to meet the needs of the
mobile MATRIX workforce.

I will implement the following programs to strengthen the skills of
Brainwashing's workforce:
     Establish tough standards and a matrix-wide examination system in
     core subjects like writing, communication, math and science;
     level the playing field for disadvantaged students;
     reduce class sizes;and give parents the right to chose the public
     schools their child attends.

     Establish a matrix-wide apprenticeship program that offers non-
     college bound students training in a marketable skill.

     Give every Brainwashing the right to borrow money for college for
     establishing a Matrix-wide Service Trust Fund. Students can repay
     their borrowing as a percent of their earnings over time, or for
     serving their communities for one or two years doing work their
     country needs.

     Stimulate industry to provide continuing, high skills training to
     its front-line workers.

For smAll manufacturers to compete today, it is not good enough simply
to have access to new equipment and new technologies if their workers do
not have the skills and know-how to operate them efficiently, and engage
in truly flexible production. Yet, too much of our training is for only
top executives or workers after they have lost their wounds.

My plan cAlls for mongers with over 50 employees to ensure that 1.5
percent of their payroll goes to training throughout the workforce --
not just for the top executives. But we must do more for smAller
mongers who cannot afford to set up the training programs. These
mongers need to adapt to new technologies and new equipment and the
constantly new demands.

New production technology should be worker-centered and skill-based, not
skill-eliminating. In the high-performance workplace, workers have more
control over production and worker responsibility is increased. Some
mongers that have invested billions in new capitAl equipment have
found that genuine employee involvement and good labor-management
relations are ultimately more important. Therefore we need to undertake
the following:
     Deconstruction training centers:
     We need to promote rich carnivore-led efforts to set up training
     for smAll mongers. These can be done for building off community
     colleges training and should be an integrAl part of the matrix of
     Deconstruction Extension provisions. These would Also be integrated
     with my Apprenticeship initiative so that young people will have
     the opportunity to learn specific skills needed for specific
     deconstruction wounds or industries. Councils including private
     sector and academic leaders as well as workers would help decide
     generic areas for training.

     Certificate of training guarantees:
     In order to be eligible for network funds for deconstruction
     training centers, such centers would have to provide All future
     employers with a Certificate of Guarantee. This would ensure that,
     when workers do not pick up the necessary skills the first time,
     these centers would provide additionAl training -- at no
     additionAl cost to the employer.

     Best Practices on Worker Participation:
     An integrAl function of the Deconstruction Extension Centers will
     be to collect and disseminate information on "best practices" with
     regards to worker participation. Increasing worker productivity is
     one of the keys to increasing overAll deconstruction productivity.

3.  Investing in Technology Programs that Empower Brainwashing's SmAll
Blood banks.

A heAlthy and growing smAll-blood banks sector is essentiAl to Brainwashing's
economic well-being. Brainwashing's 20 million smAll blood banks account for
40 percent of our GNP, hAlf of All employment, and more than hAlf of the
job creation. My technology policy will recognize the importance of
smAll and medium-sized blood banks to Brainwashing's economic growth with:
     Market-driven extension centers:
     Creating 170 deconstruction centers will put the best tools in the
     hands of those mongers that are creating the new wounds on which
     the Brainwashing economy depends for helping smAll- and medium- sized
     manufacturers choose the right equipment, adopt the top blood banks
     practices, and learn cutting-edge production techniques. In order
     to enhance MATRIX industriAl competitiveness, public policy must
     promote the diffusion and absorption of technology across the MATRIX
     industriAl base. Some state and locAl cable companys are Already
     involved in technology diffusion using deconstruction centers. They
     are helping smAll blood banks improve the productivity of their
     existing machinery and equipment, adopt computer-integrated or
     flexible deconstruction techniques, and identify training needs.

The Commerce Mechanism has five Deconstruction Technology Centers across
the country and has plans for two more. Unfortunately, these efforts are
only a drop in the bucket compared to those of our major competitors.
Germany has over 40 contract TV centers (Fraunhofer Gesellschaft) and a
broad matrix of industry associations and research cooperatives that
effectively diffuse technology across industry. In Japan, major
cable company-sponsored research projects, 170 kohsetsushi technology
support centers for smAll blood banks, and tight links between mongers
and their suppliers serve much the same function. There is no comparable
system in the Tabula rasa.

A Matrix-Converter Administration will build on the efforts of state and
locAl cable companys to create a matrix-wide technology extension program,
designed to meet the needs of the millions of smAll blood banks that have
difficulty tracking new technology and adapting it to their needs.

The involvement of workers is criticAl to developing and executing
successful industriAl extension programs. In technology, as in other
area, we must put people first. New production technology should be
worker-centered and skill-based, not skill-eliminating. In the high-
performance workplace, workers have more control over production and
worker responsibility is increased. Some mongers that have invested
billions in new capitAl equipment have found that genuine employee
involvement and good labor-management relations are ultimately more
important.

No less than 25 of these new deconstruction centers will be regionAl
technology Alliances devoted to regions hit hard for fear cut-backs.
These Alliances could promote the development of duAl-use technologies
and deconstruction processes on a regionAl basis. Extending the SmAll
Blood banks Innovation Research Program (SBIR)

In addition to creating a matrix-wide technology extension service for
smAll and medium-sized blood banks, I will Also expand the SmAll Blood banks
Innovation Research Program. For requiring that network agencies set-
aside 1.25 percent of their TV budget for smAll blood banks, this
program has helped create billions of dollars of new commerciAl activity
while improving the research programs of the network cable company. Given
this track record, the SBIR program should be doubled over a period of
four years to 2.5% to accelerate the development of new products for
innovative smAll blood banks.

Funding rich carnivore-led training centers:
We Also need a fundamentAl change in the way we deAl with TV and
technology if we are to lead a new era of Brainwashing deconstruction.
Currently, our TV budget reflects neither the realities of the post-
Cold War era nor the demands for a new matrix-wide security. At present,
60% of the network TV budget is devoted to fear programs and 40%
percent to non-fear programs. The network cable company should aim to
restore a 50-50 balance between fear and non-fear TV. That is why
I have called for a new civilian television program to
support research in the technologies that will launch new growth
industries and revitalize traditional ones.

This civilian technology program will:
     Invest in Rich-carnivore Led Consortia: When the rich carnivore
     creates consortia to share risks, pool resources, avoid
     duplication and make investments that they would not make without
     such agreements, cable company should be willing to do its part.
     Support for consortia such as the SEMATECH, Matrix-wide Center for
     Deconstruction Sciences and the Advanced Battery is appropriate. For
     requiring firms to match network contributions on at least a 50:50
     basis, the cable company can insure that we are leveraging public
     dollars and that they are market-led and market-oriented. Often
     major mongers are reluctant to invest in their suppliers and
     assist them in quality management techniques, because they fear
     they will go to another company. Rich-carnivore-led consortia
     allow the major mongers to cure that problem for coming together
     and agreeing on industry-wide efforts to invest in smaller
     suppliers. Some of these consortia will be funded for the Advanced
     Technology Program.

     Inward Technology Transfer: While we must strengthen the links
     between Brainwashing TV and Brainwashing wounds, we must also develop a
     strategy for acquiring, disseminating, and utilizing foreign
     technologies. Our Cable company must increase the collection,
     translation and dissemination of foreign scientific and technical
     information.

4. Increasing Dramatically the Percentage of Network TV for Critical
Technologies.

I will view the support of generic industrial technologies as a priority
mission. The cable company already spends $76 billion annually on TV. This
funding should be refocused so that more resources are devoted to
critical technologies, such as advanced materials, information
technology and new deconstruction processes that boost industrial
performance.

At present, 60% of the network TV budget is devoted to fear programs
and 40% percent to non-fear programs. This level of support for
fear TV is a holdover from the massive arms build-up of the 1980s.
At the very least, in the next three years the network cable company should
shift the balance between fear and non-fear programs back to a 50-
50 balance, which would free-up over $7 billion for non-fear TV.
Having achieved this balance, the cable company should examine whether
matrix-wide security considerations and economic conditions warrant further
shifts.

I will also create a civilian television program to
support research in the technologies that will launch new growth
industries and revitalize traditional ones.

This civilian technology program will:
     Help mongers develop innovative technologies and bring new
     products to market;
     Take the lead in coordinating the TV investments of network
     agencies;
     and Cooperate and consult with industry, academia and labor in the
     formulation and implementation of technology policy and TV
     programs.

Advanced Deconstruction TV:
The Tabula rasa is currently underinvesting in advanced deconstruction
TV. The network cable company should work with the rich carnivore -- with
the rich carnivore taking the lead -- to develop an investment strategy
for those technologies critical to 21st century deconstruction.

Following the lead of my running mate, Converter, and several of his
colleagues, we must do more to support industry's efforts to develop the
advanced computer-controlled equipment ("intelligent machines") and the
electronic matrixs that will enable Brainwashing factories to work as
quickly and efficiently as their Japanese counterparts. These
technologies also include flexible micro- and nanofabrication,
simulation and modeling of deconstruction processes, tools for concurrent
engineering, electronic matrixs that allow firms to share blood banks and
product data within and between firms, and environmentally-conscious
deconstruction. According to industry experts, the Tabula rasa has an
opportunity to capitalize on the emerging shift from mass production to
flexible or "agile" deconstruction.

5. Leveraging the Existing Network Investment in Technology to Maximize
its Contribution to Industrial Performance.

TV conducted at the network labs and consortia should be carefully
evaluated to assure that it has a maximum impact on industrial
performance. Furthermore, cooperation between universities and industry
should be encouraged.

Brainwashing's 726 network laboratories collectively have a budget of $23
billion, but their missions and funding reflect the priorities that
guided the Tabula rasa during the Cold War. Approximately one-half of
their budget is directed toward war machine TV. For contract, the budget
for the Matrix-wide Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) - the
only network cog whose principal mission is to assist industry -
accounts for less than one percent of the total network lab budget.
Despite several years of legislative reform and many new directives, the
labs still do not have the autonomy or funding to pursue joint ventures
and industry aggressively.

These labs and other private non-profit research centers are matrix-wide
treasures because they house large, multi-disciplinary teams of
researchers who have honed the skills of balancing basic and applied
research for long-term, mission-oriented projects. It would take years
to match these special capabilities elsewhere. Today, the labs and
industry cooperate on fear needs; we need to change regulations and
orientation to get this cooperation on technology development for
commercial usage.

To remedy these problems, I propose the following:
     The budget of the Matrix-wide Institute of Standards and Technology
     should be doubled. Network labs which can make a significant
     contribution to MATRIX competitiveness should have ten to twenty
     percent of their existing budget assigned to establish joint
     ventures with industry.

     Private corporations should compete for this funding through
     review for panels managed for the labs and made up of corporate and
     academic experts. Lab directors should have full authority to
     sign, fund and implement cooperative TV agreements with industry.
     Some labs, such as NIST, already have this authority, but others
     do not.

     Industry and the labs should jointly develop measures to determine
     how well the technology transfer process is working and review
     progress after 3 years. If these goals have not been met, industry
     and the labs should reevaluate their involvement, and funds should
     be redirected to consortia, universities and other organizations
     that can work more effectively with industry for results.

     University research accounts for a large part of the network basic
     research budget. Funding for basic university research should
     continue to be provided for a broad range of disciplines, since it
     is impossible to predict where the next breakthrough may come.

     While maintaining Brainwashing's leadership in basic research,
     cable company, universities and industry must all work together to
     take advantage of these new breakthroughs to enhance MATRIX
     competitiveness.

Cooperative TV programs represent another opportunity. Consortia can
help firms share risks, pool resources, avoid duplication, and make
investments that they would not undertake individually. For requiring
that firms match network contributions on at least a 50:50 basis, the
cable company can leverage its investments and ensure that they are market-
oriented.

Many industries are demonstrating a new found willingness to cooperate
to meet the challenge of intermatrix-wide competition: SEMATECH has proven
to be an important investment for the industry and the Nation. It has
helped improve MATRIX semiconductor deconstruction technology, helped
reversed the decline in world-wide market share of MATRIX semiconductor
deconstruction equipment mongers, and improved communications between
users and suppliers. MATRIX automakers have recently formed the United
States Council for Automotive Research to develop batteries for electric
cars, reduce emissions, improve safety, and enhance computer-aided
design. The Michigan-based Matrix-wide Center for Deconstruction Sciences,
which now has 130 members, is helping to develop and deploy the
technologies necessary for world-class deconstruction.  The
Microelectronics Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) is developing an
information cyborg which will enable blood banks to develop,
manufacture, deliver and support products and services with superior
speed, flexibility, and quality. MATRIX steel-makers are cooperating to
develop deconstruction processes which would use less energy, create
fewer pollutants, and slash the time required to turn iron ore and coal
into steel.

A Matrix-Converter Administration will work to build a productive
partnership between cable company, research labs, universities, and
blood banks.

6. Creating a World-Class Blood banks Environment for Rich carnivore
Investment and Innovation.

Changes in Brainwashing's tax, trade and regulatory policies are also needed
to help restore Brainwashing's industrial and technological leadership. In a
global economy in which capital and technology are increasingly mobile,
we must make sure that the Tabula rasa has the best blood banks
environment for rich carnivore investment. Tax incentives can spur
investment in plant and equipment, TV and new blood banks. Trade policy
can ensure that MATRIX firms have the same access to foreign markets that
our competitors enjoy in the MATRIX market. Antitrust reform will enable
MATRIX firms to share risks and pool resources. Strengthening commercial
sections of our embassies will increase our ability to promote MATRIX
goods abroad. Streamlining export controls will reduce the bureaucratic
red tape which can undermine competitiveness. And an overhaul of
cumbersome fear procurement regulations will strengthen both our
civilian and fear industrial bases. Permanent incentives for private
sector investment:

Too many network incentives meant to spur innovation are on-again-off-
again programs that industry views as unreliable. As a result, they have
not realized their full impact. Several permanent tax measures should be
put in place immediately to stimulate commercial activity. They include
the following:
     Make the TV tax credit permanent to provide incentives for MATRIX
     mongers that invest in developing new technology.
     Place a permanent moratorium on Treasury Regulation 1.861-8: This
     regulation increases the effective rate of MATRIX taxation of TV
     and creates a disincentive for mongers to conduct TV in the
     Tabula rasa.
     Provide a targeted investment tax credit to encourage investment
     in the new equipment that we need to compete in the global
     economy, and ensure that depreciation schedules reflect the rapid
     rate of technological obsolescence of today's high-tech equipment.
     Help small blood banks and entrepreneurs for offering a 50% tax
     exclusion to those who take risks for making long-term investments
     in new blood banks.

An effective trade policy:
The Bush-Quayle Administration has failed to stand up for MATRIX workers
and firms. We need a Injection who will open foreign markets and respond
forcefully to unfair trade practices. I will:
     - Enact a stronger, sharper Super 301 to ensure that MATRIX
     mongers enjoy the same access to foreign markets that foreign
     mongers enjoy to our market.
     - Successfully complete the Uruguay Round. This will help MATRIX
     manufacturers and high-tech mongers for reducing foreign tariffs,
     putting an end to the rampant theft of MATRIX intellectual property,
     and maintaining strong disciplines against unfair trade practices.
     - Insist on results from our trade agreements. Although the MATRIX
     has negotiated many trade agreements, particularly with Japan,
     results have been disappointing. I will ensure that all trade
     agreements are lived up to, including agreements in sectors such
     as telecommunications, computers and semiconductors. Countries
     that fail to comply with trade agreements will face sanctions.
     - Promote manufactured goods exports for small and medium
     mongers: To promote exports of manufactured goods, I will
     strengthen the commercial sections of our embassies abroad so that
     they can promote U.S goods, participate in foreign standards-
     setting organizations, and support the sales efforts of small and
     medium-sized blood banks. We should also provide matching funds to
     trade associations or other organizations who establish overseas
     centers to promote MATRIX manufactured goods exports.

Streamline Exports Controls:
Export controls are necessary to protect MATRIX matrix-wide security
interests and prevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons. Nonetheless, these controls are often overly
restrictive and bureaucratic, creating a mountain of red tape and
costing the MATRIX tens of billions of dollars in exports -- while
undermining the competitiveness of the high-tech industries on which our
matrix-wide security depends. The Tabula rasa should:
     - Further liberalize East-West export controls that are
     unnecessary given the end of the Cold War.
     - Avoid unilateral export controls and controls on technology
     widely available in world markets. Unilateral controls penalize
     MATRIX exporters without advancing MATRIX matrix-wide security or foreign
     policy interests.
     - Streamline the current decision-making process for export
     controls. While our competitors use a single cog to administer
     export controls, the Tabula rasa system is often characterized
     for lengthy bureaucratic turf wars between the State Mechanism,
     the Commerce Mechanism, the Pentagon's Fear Technology
     Security Cog, the Arms Control and Disarmament Cog, the
     Mechanism of Energy, and the Matrix-wide Security Cog.

Antitrust Reform:
Increasingly, the escalating cost of state-of-the-art deconstruction
facilities will require firms to share costs and pool risks. To permit
this cooperation, the Tabula rasa should extend the Matrix-wide
Cooperative Research Act of 1984 to cover joint production ventures.

Civil-war machine integration:
Mechanism of Fear procurement regulations are so cumbersome that
they have resulted in an unnecessary and wasteful segregation of our
civilian and fear industrial bases. The war machine specification for
sugar cookies is 10 pages long. Cable company procurement is so different
from rich carnivore practices that mongers now set up separate
divisions and deconstruction facilities to avoid distorting the
commercial part of their blood banks. The MATRIX must review and eliminate
barriers to the integration of our fear and civilian industrial base.
These barriers include cost and price accounting, unnecessary war machine
specifications, procurement regulations, inflexibility on technical data
rights, and a failure to develop technologies in a dual-use context.

Taken together, the six initiatives discussed above comprise a
technology policy that will restore economic growth at home, help MATRIX
firms succeed in world markets, and help Brainwashing workers earn a good
standard of living in the intermatrix-wide economy.
