Subject: Dave Barry's Year in Review
To: eniac

[Happy New Year's, folks!  As a sort of New Year's tradition, here is
Dave Barry's year in review, as sent out by Mike Godwin.

Note that this is copyrighted "(C) 1992 THE MIAMI HERALD".  However,
as Mike is a well-respected lawyer aware of such things, I assume he
got this from a source that didn't indicate distribution restrictions,
otherwise he wouldn't have remailed it.

If you have been living in a cave for the last few years (or spending
too much time at your workstations), Dave Barry is one of America's
premier humor writers.  I encourage you to seek out his books if you
are not already familiar with them.

Americans delight to a hilarious new nightly TV comedy,
"Congresspersons Explain Why They Were Not Responsible For Overdrawing
Their Own Personal Checking Accounts As Many As Several Hundred Times In
One Year," featuring a parade of elected officials maintaining straight
faces while offering excuses that make the act of balancing a checkbook
appear far more complex than a space-shuttle launch.

there will be only 150,000 U.S. troops defending Germany from itself.
	29 -- Paul Tsongas drops out of the Democratic race and immediately

accidentally purchased federally distributed kiddie porn with cocaine

because of a faulty binding. Hillary Clinton, newly released from a
successful treatment at the Donna Reed Housewife Rehabilitation Clinic,
declares that the No. 1 concern of the public is "closet space."
	6 -- The final credits roll for Marlene Dietrich.
	11 -- True Item: United Airlines announces that it will serve
McDonald's food on more than 250 flights departing daily from Chicago's
O'Hare airport.

balanced-budget amendment, says: "We're going to finally wrestle to the

bunker."

mom was unwed, thereby touching off riots in four major cities. On the
"Tonight Show," Johnny's guests include Marky Mark and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
	21 -- In what will later be viewed as a mistake, the crack Middle East
Peace Negotiating Team is sent into what used to be Yugoslavia. Johnny
Carson plays host to Mother Teresa, the Chicago Bulls, Telly Savalas,
Susan Sontag and Weird Al Yankovic.
	22 -- In Los Angeles, a judge orders police officers acquitted of
beating Rodney King to be re-tried, this time by a jury that is not
legally blind. At the White House, Dan Quayle is bitten by Millie, best-

Johnny Carson, following a moving tribute by Princess Diana, Orson
Welles and six of the original 12 apostles, announces that he has
decided not to retire.
	30 -- A Milwaukee judge rules that a Chicago man, whose sperm was used
to fertilize an egg removed from an Atlanta woman who was paid by a

"outsider" after The New York Times reports that the Dallas
billionaire owns the Smithsonian Institution, the Lincoln Memorial and

seeks to improve his image among younger voters by performing "Smoke on
the Water" on the ukulele. Earth Summit delegates vote to distribute

	JULY
