I'm going to slow down the SURFPUNK Technical Journal mailing list
for the holidays.  I've got a few things that have been piling up,
and will try do dispense them in the next 24 hours.   It may be
kinda quiet after that until the new year.

Someone asked about having DIGEST format instead of discrete SURFPUNK
mailings.  Three thoughts on that:  1. Most people's mailers summarize,
save, delete, and otherwise manage real messages better than DIGESTs.
2. That'll work better with MIME encapsulation of the individual
messages, which should be an option, for those whose software can
handle it (or have the abilility to compile and use software that can
handle it -- some places like the WELL do not allow you to build your
own stuff easily).  3.  I'll try and send SURFPUNKS in daily bursts,
so you don't get biffed and interrupted thoughout the day.  That'll
take my changing my software, which won't happen until January.

And I'm shifting my title to Captain.  Since this is an adventure,
not a research project, it seems more appropriate, as well as more 
alliterate.  [ "And remember, he's not a real doctor -- 'I have
a Master's Degree!  In Science!' "       -- doctor science ]

Oh, and some ask "what is a COCOT?"  Customer Owned Coin Operated
Telephone.  The ones that charge inordinate prices, have lousy
electronics, and make it as difficult as possible to get in touch with
operators, long distance companies of your choice, and voicemail &
beepers via touch tones.  The second most maddening technology in
america (after shoulder straps that grab you by the neck if you open
the front left door).  And the absolute ELITE among pay phones:  you do
things their way, by their rules, at their prices, or not at all!  

/* The latest issue of 2600 describes ways for COCOT Robin Hoods to get
revenge ... but as with any other phreaking information, if you're not
a reasonably accomplished phreak yourself, you should check it out with
someone who is, to learn the real risks -- especially if it's
widely-published and old information, like this is ...*/ 


                                Happy Holiday Hacking!     Captain Cocot

p.s. 	I'm planning on attending the WELL office party in SoMa (SF) 
	this friday night.  It's open; write me for directions.

Do you know the commercial where the heavily mustached old woman in a
black shroud drinks strawberry Nestle' Quik and turns into a buxom
bombshell in pasties and G-string, and she squats down for a second in a
mud puddle, and when she gets up, her buttocks are covered with leeches,
and Jesus appears holding a Barbie, and two beams of sparkling particles
shoot from the eyes of the Barbie and vaporize the leeches, and the
Bombshell gets on her motorcycle, and pink florets of exhaust spurt from
the tailpipe spelling out the words  BE ALL THAT YOU CAN BE?  Try
watching that on drugs.  It's un-fucking-believable.

spin surf or spin punk.  Undetected, we are both, or might be neither.
