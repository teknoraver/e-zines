MATH RIOTS PROVE FUN INCALCULABLE
/by/ Eric Zorn

/begin italics/
News Item (June 23) -- Mathematicians worldwide were excited and
pleased today by the announcement that Princeton University professor
Andrew Wiles had finally proved Fermat's Last Theorem, a 365-year-old
problem said to be the most famous in the field.
/end italics/

Yes, admittedly, there was rioting and vandalism last week during the
celebration. A few bookstores had windows smashed and shelves stripped,
and vacant lots glowed with burning piles of old dissertations. But
overall we can feel relief that it was nothing -- nothing -- compared
to the outbreak of exuberant thuggery that occurred in 1984 after
Louis DeBranges finally proved the Bieberbach Conjecture.

"Math hooligans are the worst," said a Chicago Police Department
spokesman. "But the city learned from the Bieberbach riots. We were
ready for them this time."

When word hit Wednesday that Fermat's Last Theorem had fallen, a
massive show of force from law enforcement at universities all around
the country headed off a repeat of the festive looting sprees that have
become the traditional accompaniment to triumphant breakthroughs in
higher mathematics.

Mounted police throughout Hyde Park kept crowds of delirious wizards at
the University of Chicago from tipping over cars on the midway as they
first did in 1976 when Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel cracked the
long-vexing Four-Color Problem. Incidents of textbook-throwing and
citizens being pulled from their cars and humiliated with difficult
story problems last week were described by the university's math
department chairman Bob Zimmer as "isolated."

Zimmer said, "Most of the celebrations were orderly and peaceful. But
there will always be a few -- usually graduate students -- who use any
excuse to cause trouble and steal. These are not true fans of Andrew
Wiles."

Wiles himself pleaded for calm even as he offered up the proof that
there is no solution to the equation  x^n + y^n = z^n  when  n  is a
whole number greater than two, as Pierre de Fermat first proposed in
the 17th Century. "Party hard but party safe," he said, echoing the
phrase he had repeated often in interviews with scholarly journals as
he came closer and closer to completing his proof.

Some authorities tried to blame the disorder on the provocative
taunting of Japanese mathematician Yoichi Miyaoka. Miyaoka thought he
had proved Fermat's Last Theorem in 1988, but his claims did not bear
up under the scrutiny of professional referees, leading some to
suspect that the fix was in. And ever since, as Wiles chipped away
steadily at the Fermat problem, Miyaoka scoffed that there would be no
reason to board up windows near universities any time soon; that God
wanted Miyaoka to prove it.

In a peculiar sidelight, Miyaoka recently took the trouble to secure a
U.S. trademark on the equation "x^n + y^n = z^n " as well as the
now-ubiquitous expression "Take that, Fermat!" Ironically, in defeat,
he stands to make a good deal of money on cap and T-shirt sales.

This was no walk-in-the-park proof for Wiles. He was dogged, in the
early going, by sniping publicity that claimed he was seen puttering
late one night doing set theory in a New Jersey library when he either
should have been sleeping, critics said, or focusing on arithmetic
algebraic geometry for the proving work ahead.

"Set theory is my hobby, it helps me relax," was his angry explanation.
The next night, he channeled his fury and came up with five critical
steps in his proof. Not a record, but close.

There was talk that he thought he could do it all by himself,
especially when he candidly referred to University of California
mathematician Kenneth Ribet as part of his "supporting cast," when most
people in the field knew that without Ribet's 1986 proof definitively
linking the Taniyama Conjecture to Fermat's Last Theorem, Wiles would
be just another frustrated guy in a tweed jacket teaching calculus to
freshmen.

His travails made the ultimate victory that much more explosive for
math buffs. When the news arrived, many were already wired from
caffeine consumed at daily colloquial teas, and the took to the streets
en masse shouting, "Obvious! Yessss! It was obvious!"

The law cannot hope to stop such enthusiasm, only to control it.  Still,
one
has to wonder what the connection is between wanton pillaging and a
mathematical proof, no matter how long-awaited and subtle.

The Victory Over Fermat rally, held on a cloudless day in front of a
crowd of 30,000 (police estimate: 150,000) was pleasantly peaceful.
Signs unfurled in the audience proclaimed Wiles the greatest
mathematician of all time, though partisans of Euclid, Descartes,
Newton, and C.F. Gauss and others argued the point vehemently.

A warmup act, The Supertheorists, delighted the crowd with a ragged
song, "It Was Never Less Than Probable, My Friend," which included such
gloating, barbed verses as --- "I had a proof all ready / But then I
did a choke-a / Made liberal assumptions / Hi! I'm Yoichi Miyaoka."

In the speeches from the stage, there was talk of a dynasty,
specifically that next year Wiles will crack the great unproven Riemann
Hypothesis ("Rie-peat! Rie-peat!" the crowd cried), and that after the
Prime-Pair Problem, the Goldbach Conjecture ("Minimum Goldbach," said
one T-shirt) and so on.

They couldn't just let him enjoy his proof. Not even for one day. Math
people. Go figure 'em.

Subject: Emerald Tablets of Hermes


Dear Folk,


I am involved on a research project concerning the magical papyri
recently.  I was struck this weekend, while a friend helped learn
how to use UUDCODE (which he had downloaded from Northern
Lights), how similar the technologies of the magician writing
magical papyri in the first four centuries of the common era and
the current  computer technology is.  Magic in the Roman Empire
was a crime against the state, so the magical books utilized
means of compression and encoding -- the development of compact
meaningful utterance -- loaded with meaning for the Initiate --
and meaningless for the non-Initiate.  This is an interesting
remanifestation.  The early use hid valuable information in an
information dry age -- today as we are drowning in information
codes become more and more important to present the useful
information as a pure stream among the filth.

I was playing around with the Emerald Tablets of Hermes with a
view for toward a semiotic theory of magic, and came up with what
is below.  Feel free to share this with anyone, who you feel
might be interested.

        The Precepts of Hermes Trismegistus
        (Authentically Translated from an Unknown Tongue)

I.  What I say is not fictitious but reliable and true.

II.  What is below is like what is above, and what is above is
like what is below.  They work to accomplish the wonders of the
One Thing.

III.  As all things were created by the One Word of the Mind, so
all things were created by the One Thing by adaptation.

IV.  I Hermes-Toth am the teacher of magic and did create words
for magic is a process of inter-reality communication.

V.  Magic is the process by which that which is below is able to
communicate its will to that which is above,and change the subtle
paradigms of that which is above.  If this is done that which is
below shall receive a message in the form of a modification of
the environment below.

VII.  That this should be so is not subject to objective
experimentation.  It is a divine event, a legacy from the Mind to
the Children of Sophia, whose honeyed lips drip with wisdom.
These last born Children are the most mutable of all beings,and
must remember to separate the subtle from the coarse, and to be
prudent and circumspect as they do so.

VIII.  Magical communication does not take place as the speech of
men and women in the marketplace, which I Hermes-Toth also rule,
but it does follow the same Archetype, which I myself created in
order that I might see the worlds.

IX. This has more virtue than Virtue, herself, because it
controls every subtle thing and it penetrates every subtle thing.

X.  This is the way the world is created and re-created.

XI.  This is the origin of the wonders that are performed here.

XII.  This is why I am called "Thrice Greatest Hermes" for hold
the Mysteries of the Sender, the Receiver, and the Message.

XIII. What I had to say here about the Process of Transformation
is finished.

Cyborganics 

by
Don Webb



My favorite haunts have always been the places where I can trade
ideas and dreams, and occasionally do a little business.  In
short I seek out the hidden temples of Hermes, god of
communication, commerce, and magic.  The best temple I've found
in quite sometime is Fringeware, whose fathers are Paco Xander
Nathan and Jon Lebkowsky and whose mother is the Internet. I
interviewed Paco Nathan Xander after his recent trip to Europe --
Fringeware is far more than an Austin based BBS and mail order
catalog service -- it does business in Europe, Japan an Latin
America (as well as extensive sales in the US and Canada).  The
big idea that Fringeware promotes is Cyborganics, which Paco
defined for me, "Cyborganics - a community, alive, growing around
a marketplace based on people and machines merged into an ecology
of activities.  It may sound like science fiction, but it's real,
day to day biz for us."
 
Fringeware sells books,magazines, Do-It-Yourself electronics, DIY
Brain reprogrammers, and independently developed software.  It
gives away ideas and dreams.  Fringeware exists as an electronic
list, that is to say whenever Jon or Paco or any member of the list
mails things to Fringeware, it shows up in everybody's'
electronic mailboxes.  So not only are there product annocemnets
from Jon and Paco, but filmmaker David Blair discussing his film Wax, 
or virtual reality art show announcements, or information on
the cypherpunk movement, or open ended discussion on Buddhist
economics.  The best trades here are those of ideas and
Principles.
 
The best selling physical items are: Bestsellers: two categories
seem to run in the lead.. electronic publications and brain
machines.  So we have titles like Beyond Cyberpunk, Electronic
Hollywood and all the Voyager Expanded Book series.  Then on the
brain side, we've got Day Dreamer (nonelectronic - REALLY great)
and the cool, low-cost, post-newage Synetics line (electronic). 
Funny thing, but our ebook titles are all for the Mac - people
always come to us demanding DOS titles and it's a joke..  Apple
plowed a whole lot of cash under-writing the grassroots
multimedia revolution while Microsoft was busy undermining small
developers in the same arena - so now the fallout is that nobody
wants to write DOS multimedia w/o a ridiculously top-heavy
business plan.. Actually, the Platform Wars really strike a sour
spot in me - I stay away FAR from people who get dogmatic about
machines,  . wanting to run multimedia on DOS or spreadsheets on
Unix - wrong tool for the wrong purpose - being a software
developer on Mac, DOS, Windows, Unix, etc., I could go on at
length about this particular form of human perversity."  
Fringeware has a typically value added catalog including great
fiction, art, and ideas plus the product line.  Paco said of the
catalog, "A person can make initial contact by neocranially
fondling a copy of Fringe Ware Review off the newsstand and
finding where to proceed from there. That was carefully crafted
as an intro to our biz: good roadmap, pretty easy to parse. We're
looking for people to buy the magazines, always looking for good
writers and artists, people to buy products, vendors selling
products, interesting people to interview/grok, cyborganic events
to help sponsor, people to participate in the online email list,
etc., so there's plenty of avenues for approach. My favorite is
when somebody sends a check in the mail with a note saying "12
widgets to the following address" but of course most of our mail
is much stranger and more wonderfully diverse."
 
If you want to contact Fringeware directly (to obtain a catalog,
or join their Email service, which I can not recommend too highly):

  FringeWare Inc.
  PO Box 49921
  Austin, TX 78765 USA
  fringeware@wixer.bga.com
 
 Jon and Paco both came from solid business backgrounds, they
decided to play the game on their own terms, and for rewards
beyond, but including the buck.  Paco's words on the subject are
worth considering,"  Jon and I are both writers, with diverse
histories of other talents, but we could surmise our common
goal/focus under a single heading: cyborganics.  I really dare
just about anybody to go get a really good education, then get
involved in high-tech megacorp biz for several years, then jump
out on their own and consider how to make a living in the midst
of a burgeoning Info Economy.  I mean, take a hard look at what
the monicker "Info Economy" really implies in terms of which
markets will live and which will die.  My own resume reads: West
Point, Stanford, IBM, NASA, Bell Labs, etc., so I'm not just
musing here.."

                          PRELIMINARY AGENDA
           5th Computer Security Incident Handling Workshop
Sponsored by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)

                          August 10-13, 1993
                            St. Louis, MO


TUESDAY, August 10, 1993  Full-day Tutorials

1.  Creating a Security Policy
    presented by Charles Cresson Wood:

      [no abstract available at time of posting]

2.  Vulnerabilities of the IBM PC Architecture: Virus, Worms, Trojan
      Horses, and Things That Go Bump In The Night
    presented by A. Padgett Peterson:

  An intensive look into the architecture of the IBM-PC and MS/PC-DOS --
  What it is and why it was designed that way. An understanding of
  assembly language and the interrupt structure of the Intel 80x86
  processor is helpful.

  The day will begin with the BIOS and what makes the PC a fully
  functional computer before any higher operating system is introduced.
  Next will be a discussion of the various operating systems, what they
  add and what is masked. Finally, the role and effects of the PC and
  various LAN configurations (peer-peer and client server) will be
  examined with emphasis on the potential protection afforded by login
  scripting and RIGHTS.

  At each step, vulnerabilities will be examined and demonstrations made
  of how malicious software exploits them. Demonstrations may include
  STONED, MICHELANGELO, AZUSA, FORM, JERUSALEM, SUNDAY, 4096, and EXEBUG
  viruses depending on time and equipment available.

  On completion attendees will understand the vulnerabilities and how to
  detect attempted exploitation using simple tools included with DOS
  such as DEBUG and MEM.

3.  Unix Security
    presented by Matt Bishop:

  Unix can be a secure operating system if the appropriate controls and
  tools are used.  However, it is difficult for even experienced system
  administrators to know all the appropriate controls to use.  This
  tutorial covers the most important aspects of Unix security
  administration, including internal and external controls, useful
  tools, and administration techniques to develop better security.

  Upon completion, Unix system administrators will have a better understanding
  of vulnerabilities in Unix, and of methods to protect their systems.

                Subject: thanks for the U S Government Subscription 
                                        catalogs and brochures
                Date: Thu, 08 Jul 93 13:50:19 -0700
                 
                Someone ordered me an U S Government Subscription catalog
                and one of each Subject Bibliography brochure (except for
                subject bibliographies number 23 and 69, of which they
                ordered ten of each.) This amounts to an 8" stack of
                material.

                anyway, given the choice of which brochures multiple copies
                were ordered, I have a feeling that the requesting agent
                reads this list.

                And I wanna say THANKS!  WAY COOL SHIT!
