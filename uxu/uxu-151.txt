                                Introduction 
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^  
 
       This  article is written to educate fellow hackers/phreakers  and 
       software  traders  on  what will be happening in  the  future  in 
       regards to computers and electronic communication. This is only a 
       short article and only a few things have been included by  varies 
       sources etc... It also involves the  recent busts which have been 
       happening   Australia  wide  and the  tapping of the phone  lines 
       on a number of  bulletin  boards. 
           This  article  is not to be taken lightly and  also  involves 
       details on how we "The people can fight back" against the system
       which is designed  to  suppress the individuals rights  to  learn,
       think, privacy.
           This is not a manual on how to hack a system or how to phreak 
       without  getting caught, but rather a political  statement  about 
       how  society is being manipulated by our very own government  and 
       their  role in the total monitoring of all people in the  future. 
       if  you would like detailed information on how to hack/phreak  or 
       whatever  then  you can still obtain access to a  number  of  H/P 
       bulletin  boards which are still operating in Australia and  also 
       overseas's, there you will find what you require.
 
 
 
       " The people are the power, bring back the power to the people "
 
       We  live  in  a  society which  is  dominated  by  computers  and 
       electronic  gadgets  to  help  us  in  our  everyday  lives.  New 
       technology  is  being  invented  or  improved  upon  every  year. 
       Computers are being widely used in nearly every business, school, 
       and  the home, in fact nearly everything you can think  of.  With 
       computers  we are faced with new crimes such as  Fraud,  Hacking, 
       phreaking,  theft  etc..  These  laws were made  up  by  our  own 
       government  to protect the rights of it's people in  society,  or 
       where they ?
           The  question  must  be asked , are  the  governments  really 
       protecting  our lives, rights etc.. The answer to  that  question 
       will be determined by you the reader of this article, but let  us 
       face the facts for now. Documents have been obtained to what  the 
       government is really up to and how society fits into their  plan. 
       These  documents explain conspiracy up to the highest  levels  of 
       the  government  in stopping certain knowledge falling  into  the 
       publics view. The ultimate goal is the monitoring of every single 
       individual and also a one world government, economy and in effect 
       a total system of control over it's people. All these things  are 
       being  slowly brought to our attention and migrated into our  way 
       of  life every year. The UN which we now read about in  the  news 
       papers are going to be the one world government in the future. In 
       effect  this  means that the united states government  will  have 
       total  control, After all the UN headquarters is located  in  New 
       York.  Big business will play a vital role in the  monitoring  of 
       the  people as well as government  agencies,  telecommunications, 
       large  mining corporations, banks etc.. have more power over  the 
       people that what we are lead to believe.
 
 
 
                         Australian Governments Role
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
          Australia  is one of the leading countries operating  secretly 
       towards  the  New  World  Order.  Monitoring  of  the  people  of 
       Australia has increased dramatically over the pass 10 years.  The 
       government  tried to introduce the I.D card but too  many  people 
       rejected  their  plans, so they brought out the tax  file  number 
       instead.  Everyone  has a large file about  themselves  which  is 
       linked  up to the government agencies across Australia.  Students 
       are  monitored with either the Tax file number, Austudy  or  just 
       applications you must fill out to enter a course. It is very easy 
       to   monitor  large  numbers  of  people  now  because   of   the 
       introduction  of  large computers and also  their  networks.  Our 
       government is actively co-operating with other governments around 
       the  world and exchanging data on it's people. This  is  illegal, 
       but know one seems to care or notice, after all the key to  power 
       is knowledge.
           Camera's  are  everywhere  nowadays, not only  are  we  being 
       monitored by shop camera's but we also have speed, red light, and 
       even  football camera's which are a nice means of  raising  money 
       and  also  gathering  information.  Should  we  believe  our  own 
       government  when it is common knowledge that they lie to  us  and 
       that even our police force is very corrupt and are able to  kill, 
       bash, drink and drive, etc.. and then turn around and say that we 
       must obey their laws. Our government is using the media to play a 
       very  important  role in  advertising to us  killings,  rappings, 
       etc..  so  that we the people then turn around and say  that  "We 
       need  tighter  laws etc.." This is exactly  what  the  government 
       wants  and  needs  to  implement  it's  plan  of  total  control. 
       Documents  obtained  form varies sources on Milnet  show  clearly 
       what  the  United  states  and also  other  countries  have  been 
       researching  for  many  years  and that  is  ELF  (Extremely  Low 
       Frequency) weapons against certain people. This research  project 
       is  so  well  advanced  that it will be  for  the  normal  person 
       unbelievable.  Research has been done and put into affect on  how 
       ELF  affects  the brain waves of people, animals and  all  matter 
       itself.  This  research  has also been used  to  change  people's 
       thought patterns and is being used to manipulate people in varies 
       ways.
           Cellular phones have been introduced for many years now,  and 
       are  a  great form of monitoring society. Everytime you  turn  on 
       your  cellular phone telecom know exactly where you are  all  the 
       time,  also how long you have used the phone for etc... The  same 
       also goes for normal house, business phones. Customer details are 
       all  processed by large computer data bases and are passed on  to 
       governments  agencies when needed. People are using credit  cards 
       all  the  time  nowadays  which makes  it  much  easier  for  the 
       governments to keep track on what people are buying etc.. Noticed 
       how  we  are slowly losing our 1c 2c coins ? also other  coins  ?  
       this  is  a slow process of weaning out coins and taking  on  the 
       credit   cards  as  normal.  Why  ?   well  it's  because   every 
       transaction you make using credit cards go into a large  computer 
       in  banks etc.. and therefore it is much easier to store data  on 
       the people who use them. Cash payments are the biggest worry  for 
       the  government, because they don't have much control over  thing 
       like that - but in the future their will be no cash anyway. Large 
       corporations  buy data off other agencies. E.g. - each  time  you 
       use  your credit card, your purchase is logged and also how  much 
       you payed etc.. Now the product companies come along and buy this 
       information  off  banks, super markets etc... to  see  who  buy's 
       there  products  and also how their products are going.  This  is 
       also  illegal  because  it is invading your  privacy,  don't  you 
       worry,  the  government knows EVERYTHING about you.  What  colour 
       hair   you   have,   Size,  dental  records,   car   you   drive, 
       working/studying, food you eat, animals you own, phones you have, 
       money, house's, etc... We pay rates on almost everything now  and 
       all  that  information about us goes into a  government  agencies 
       computer  data base. They are even trying to see what garbage  we 
       throw out now. (they are trying to put electronic monitors on our 
       bins)     The   government  are  the  real   criminals.   Private 
       information about it's people are being given to other  countries 
       and  also  other agencies, companies etc.. Information  is  being 
       withheld from the public, special deals are going on secretly all 
       the  time. We even have a corrupt police force who love to  kill, 
       bash,  and  also drink drive. (it seems they  are  different  law 
       enforcement,  their law).  We now have news in the paper that  we 
       even  have  to get our cats registered. Is this a form  of  money 
       raising for the government as well as monitoring. Anyone who  has 
       been pulled over by the police will know how many questions  they 
       have  to  answer  before being let go. Even if you  are  not  the 
       driver  of the car etc.. you are forced to tell them  everything. 
       You are under no legal means to do so, but they WILL enforce you. 
       Also  isn't  it  quite strange that the head  of  government  run 
       Telecom was one of the bosses of At&t (The US company). maybe  he 
       is teaching Telecom a thing or to about how to monitor people and 
       organize  the control much better. We all know that 0014  numbers 
       and  008  numbers  are being logged, but are unsure  as  to  what 
       reasons. If their reasons of phreakers, hackers were valid,  then 
       why not just put filters on the line etc.. to stop these  people. 
       Ahhh  they have to monitor the lines and see who is calling  what 
       companies.  Also the the American NSA (National Security  Agency) 
       owns  over three quarters of the cray super computers, these  are 
       the  biggest, fastest computers in the world. Why on earth  would 
       they  need to own even half of these computers ??  Monitoring  of 
       all  people  in society is the answer. They  even  sold  computer 
       software  to  countries  all around the world  which  had  trojan 
       horses in them, so they could access it remotely themselves.  The 
       software  was also one of the fastest, most capable  software  on 
       the market for the purpose of monitoring large amounts of  people 
       in  society.  The middle east has remained so unstable  for  many 
       years due to the fact of other nations pouring millions into  the 
       countries  to de-stabilize the whole of the middle east,  why  ??  
       The answer is simple, the first biggest bankers in the world came 
       from  the middle east, because of the oil wells etc..  They  held 
       the  balance of power within the banking world. America  did  not 
       like  that, and also the other countries in the New  World  Order 
       didn't  like  that  either, so the whole  middle  east  has  been 
       de-stabilize and are fighting one another. YET who are  supplying 
       these  countries  with  the arms to fight  ???  America,  France, 
       Germany,  Australia,  etc..  most of the countries  who  are  now 
       against them. I will not go into any of this political side of it 
       as it would take far to long to explain about it. Anyway we  have 
       in  Australia a special police task force which is setup  by  the 
       government   to   look  into  the  so   called   "Normal   police 
       corruption", isn't this crazy, we have the police monitoring  the 
       police  !!   They have shown themselves to be so  corrupt  anyway 
       that it's a joke. Look at all the current affair shows of how the 
       police  have  bashed people, have drunk  and  driven  themselves, 
       etc..  It's like the blind leading the blind..  We all  know  how 
       corrupt  the police are in NSW and also WA, so what makes it  any 
       different in Vic or NT (anywhere) only they have not been  caught 
       enough YET !! Many police have told me that once your out of  the 
       public  view  your history.. But these days they do not  seem  to 
       even  care  about  bashing you behind their walls.  Look  at  the 
       Rodney  King  bashing, and also many others.. they take  the  law 
       into  their own hands and the government is letting them.   Never 
       trust  a  politician, they are the biggest liars on  this  earth. 
       They  say  they are going to do this and that and  end  up  doing 
       something  different, or not doing it at all. The  last  election 
       was proof of that, (no promise has been kept)   
       Who  do  we  have   monitoring   the governments actions ? 
       no one really, so that's where the hackers role will have to come 
       in.
 
 
 
 
 
                     Hackers & Phreakers can fight back.
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 
            Many bulletin boards have been raided by the federal  police 
       recently,  also  many boards have there telephones  tapped  in  a 
       controlled  affect  to  close down the threat  of  the  future  - 
       Hacking,  Phreaking,  Anarchy Information. The  governments  have 
       realized that as computers grow bigger and networks expand a  lot 
       further, there must be a need to protect THEIR privacy (which  is 
       really  all the data collected on us) and that is why  there  has 
       been a sudden push forward to catch the hackers, etc..  Criminals 
       are  just starting to realize that their old methods  of  getting 
       information  etc.. are out of date. It is the computer  age  now, 
       and  that is why hackers (good ones) are in upmost demand by  the 
       most  criminals  in  jail/outside these days.  Image  the  damage 
       hackers  can do by breaking into government /  military  computer 
       systems.  We  are  able with the right  knowledge  and  equipment 
       infiltrate these networks and obtain the information on what  the 
       government  is  up  too. We can see  what  the  governments  have 
       acquired  information about us. Police computers would be a  very 
       useful  tool  in  the  hackers  arsenal.  Hackers  can  find  out 
       information  regarding everyone, put out warrants for the  arrest 
       of  people  etc.. Drug enforcement computer systems would  be  an 
       advantage  for the drug dealers etc.. Military systems  would  be 
       helpful  to certain hackers to obtain classified  information  on 
       the latest technology and use it to there advantage. Hackers  can 
       break into media computer systems and change the news etc..  This 
       is  why  hackers are going to become the next  generation  of  SO 
       CALLED   criminals.  Hackers  have  the  power  to  monitor   the 
       government - and they don't like it !!!
           That is why the governments realize to stop the threat of the 
       hackers  spying  on them, then first of all they  must  stop  the 
       hackers  at  the  very heart on the situation, and  that  is  the 
       telephone  (dialing  out.. why wait until the hacker  has  logged 
       into a system before you catch him/her. Get him/her when he makes 
       the  call).  AT&T  is in the middle of trying  to  clean  up  the 
       european  countries at the moment, and they will be in  Australia 
       in  the near future. Telecom is doing a great job  in  monitoring 
       the phreakers etc.. they are currently investigating hundreds  of 
       overseas's  callers and also local callers and are informing  the 
       government  of  these people activities. The 0014 -  direct  dial 
       U.S.A number is being monitored, and most calls are being logged. 
       Also  most  008 numbers are logged and cli monitors  are  on  the 
       line.  Some  0014 numbers are logged out of every ten  people  it 
       will  record the last one. Also the federal police have  quite  a 
       few  informers  who have accounts on top boards who  are  feeding 
       then information on certain users etc.. Also I have heard a rumor 
       (not  reliable) that there are some federal police who operate  a 
       board in N.S.W and also Victoria and that they are operating  it, 
       just like a normal BBS, but when certain users get too big,  they 
       get  busted. The future looks bad for the hacker at the moment  - 
       or is it ?  We hackers phreakers, software traders must not  back 
       stab  each other, compete against each other, etc.. BUT  we  must 
       form a united information network against the government, we must 
       collect information, trade information between ourselves. We must 
       realize  that  we  have the power and  technology  to  watch  the 
       government  and  see what they are REALLY up too.  We  must  form 
       global  networks, such as future net, HSI etc.. and email  across 
       the  world with our friends. Only by realizing this power can  we 
       start  to break down the walls of the governments of our  society 
       and bring them back into reality, and let them see for themselves 
       that  the  people  do  have  a voice and  that  we  will  not  be 
       suppressed manipulated for any longer.
 
           " Bring back the power to the people "
 
            - Stop the New World Order, before it's too late -
