   I think it's time to write an Index to the uXu files, now when we have
   reached the 15th production in our standard releases, and the 5th in
   our Swedish releases. You know people said that we wouldn't be around
   longer than to release about 10 files, and still, here we are. So the
   next time you see the guy who said that before, give him a nice big
   'kick in the ass' greeting from us.
 
   I guess we will release about 10 additional files this year, so just
   keep your eyes open for new releases. We don't have any release-
   schedule, so perhaps the uXu file 16 is out before this one, but still
   we Do release new material, as time goes.
 
   Right now, we have 2 standard members & writers. Not very much you might
   say, but have you heard of us before this release? No, I didn't think so.
   This is because we haven't really been looking for new members before,
   but we are ready for new members now, and if you'd like to join us, or
   just perhaps contribute with a textfile/news/anything you want, just call
   one of the boards listed at the end of this file, and contact The Chief
   there.

Ten chapters with index, and changes. Kevin, the average computer-wiz-kid

on his way to success.

way do you prefer? GNN tells you all about it, with recommendations and
perhaps a few tips you didn't consider. The file for the suicidal!

014: "The European Digest Vol.1 Issue #5" by The Chief.   The European Digest
