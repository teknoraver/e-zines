                                  Listen

                         The warnings are coming!

                                  ALARM!

                      We are pushed towards our end!

                    God's footprints are over the earth

                    the only thing he found was a sign

                         It said "Where were you?"

                                  ALARM!

                       Like a beetle under the foot

                       we are pushed towards our end

                    Have you found the meaning of life

                   or are you still looking for nothing

                                  ALARM!

                                Time flies

                          in the other direction

                                  ALARM!

                    God's footprints are over the earth

                                once again

                  but the only thing he found was a sign

                           with an A in a circle

                                  ALARM!
