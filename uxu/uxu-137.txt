*   The intro.

*   Sure is. Way late, way off track, we're sending this small mid-late-
*   summer release from our way to the nice country of Holland! Yes,
*   indeed. uXu is attending "Hacking at the End of the Universe", the
*   prominent spectacle arranged by Hack-Tic for three fine days, early
*   august 1993 near Lelystad. A lot of stuff going on, and I am almost
*   sure that another release is not far away. A lot of input down there. :)

*                            <<< IMPORTANT >>>

*   We will have a small 'uXu at the tip of your fingers' address available
*   from HEU between the 4th -> 6th (24:00) of August, where you can send
*   comments, questions, or just check out whats happening down there through
*   the uXu crew attending. It is a temporary address, made available by
*   Hack-Tic for the conference only. All subscribers will recieve a small
*   note when it's all clear (and the address to use of course). So, please
*   feel free to send us some mail. We will answer every one of 'em. In case
*   you want to write to an uXu writer personally, just write "for xxxx" as
*   Subject, and he/she/it will get it. 

*   With that out of the way, we can continue to drewl over this package.
*   A bunch of files that really should've been released a few weeks
*   after the last release, but summer, finals, and a hacker that didn't
*   manage to cover his tracks (take a lesson or two BEFORE you try, okay?)
*   which made the sysadmins shut down the whole link to the 'net, made it
*   quite impossible to release anything brutal. Hopefully, by the time
*   you read this, our Swedish FTP site, and The Chief's address works.
*   If not, both will be back at the beginning of September. (actually,
*   Phearless just told me, the FTP site *IS* up, and TC's address works.
*   Now, don't say we don't keep our promises! :)). 'til next time.



    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?

    Jeppers! All files (0-137) are available from the sites listed at the
    end of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing The Chief at chief@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 003,022,054,065,023

    To subscribe, just let the Subject line of the letter contain the words
    "Add uXu", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon as it is
    ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are stars (or
    multiplication characters) which let you know what's new since
    last time. You don't have to read through the whole index for
    the latest info, just scan the file for the stars.


                                             Back to school soon, huh?
                                                       The Chief / uXu


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file and leave
   private mail to The Chief for further information (if needed) or to
   let us know you'd like to join. Don't hesitate! Call today!
   'netters -> E-Mail The Chief (check address at the end of the file).


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.

April  August  April  August  April  August  April  August Releases 1993:

128: "Als Sprach The GNN - Ten Topics" by The GNN.   Our brain surgeon
hits the crowd again with some mind-bending thoughts about life, the
way we know it, as it is today. Could he be right this time? Of course
he could. See what You think and pick up this piece of work.

129: "The Anatomy Of Boredom" by Ralph 124C41+.   This release really
marks somewhat of a similar cause. Ralph writes here about boredom,
why, why not, and what boredom have made possible all the way through
the dawn of the human race. Another thinker for y'all.

130: "Castle Chronicles The Sequel - Chapter Two" by The Chief.   True,
this makes me sick! "Lets have some action here, lets make it more 
cYbERpunK!" they said. Why? Why can't it develop along the lines that
were drawn up from the start? "They won't read it." they said. Well,
why didn't you say so in the first place? ssssnyderflunk you said?

131: "Dream On" by Ralph 124C41+.   One man, trapped, but not in a
place he didn't want to be - now how is that possible? Well, when
you're desperate, feeling really low, you only have one place where
you can control your surroundings. Right.

132: "The House Of The Criminally Insane" by The GNN.   What treatment
could possibly help those who are criminally insane, you ask? Hmm,
there is a better way for you to learn the answer to that question
and that is to read this cute, but really ground-shaking text.

133: "The Twelve Miscellaneous Facts About Life" by The Chief.   Two
minutes of your time, is all I ask. Just read through this, now old
but unused file found in the depths of our archives and see what
you think. Dontcha agree wit' da chief? Oh well.

134: "The Last Night Of The World" by The GNN.   Now? TODAY? What
would you do if you found out that this what the last night of
your life. Everyone's life? What would the rest of the world do
when that day came? What would happen?! HELP!

135: "Death Is Rotten" by Ralph 124C41+.   Yes, you say. Perhaps it is,
after a while. So what do we do about it? Is there a way we can go
to live longer? Here's a little story of a man who found a way, though
I don't think it is the way he wanted it to be...

136: "Live On Stage Again: Messiah!" by The GNN.   If He came to visit
you, what would you say? What would you do? What if, now this is just
a thought, what if He was just like you? The GNN brings him back again
to the scene, to explain a few things.

137: "uXu Index #12" by The Chief.   Twelve of these and you really
have the life of uXu in your hands. The index isn't something to be
thrown away! No Sir! It leaves you with a history. And every new one
gives you new sections, plus new information, general statistics and
if you didn't know it before, here are a couple of those sections
listed neatly and well for you:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
