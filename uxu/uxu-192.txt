                             "FINAL DISCOVERY"

       "Empirical laws are explained by theories, provides knowledge
        and gives science its empirical basis"
                                         (Craig Dilworth)



  We  worked on the project for twelve years without rest, me and my staff.
Our  task  was  to  build  the  best  electron  microscope  in the world, a
microscope  that  would  lead us past the atom, past the quarks and down to
the  real underground particles of physics.  We wanted to see them with our
own  eyes without the need for theories that told us what we probably would
find   down   there.    The  word  "probably"  had  haunted  us  for  ages.
Well-educated  men  told  us  their theories and we could not bear the fact
that they were only theories.  We wanted the empirical fact, the truth, the
visible  truth  -  we  wanted  to see what was down there.  We did not want
simple ideas.
  It  was  hard  work.  We  overlooked  the fact that this was an expensive
project and almost ruined our own institution.  Money did not mean anything
when you were on your way to find the truth.  People told us that no matter
how good we built the microscope it was impossible to find any truth in the
smallest  particles  of  our  world.  Even if we could see past the quarks,
they  said,  we  would  probably  find some other brick wall that we had to
conquer.  Probably.  Always "probably", never facts.  We were on our way to
the facts while they still trusted the theories.
  When  we  after  twelve  years  finally could open up the gates, turn the
microscope  on  and  show the world what was down there, no one celebrated.
Well,  the  truth  hurts  and most people do not like what gives them pain.
When  our  microscope  had  been  alive  for  one single day, we decided to
disassemble it and stuff it into the closet.  There was nothing more to see
and discover.  Chaos would probably rule the world the next day when people
realized how causal and mechanical our world really was.
  But  before  we tore down our masterpiece I had a last look into it.  For
the last time, I saw past the atom, past the quarks and all I could see was
computer pixels.
