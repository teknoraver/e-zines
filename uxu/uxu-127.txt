*   The intro.
    ----------

    Another release, another month. A lot of things have happened since
    last time, and we'll probably going to tell you more about it in the
    next release, but for now, there are a couple we're really happy
    about. First, we got our first U.S. Internet FTP Site (check address
    at the end of the file). Second, we have been roaming through our
    distribution sites (after hints that they weren't really up to date
    as supposed to) so there are a couple of changes there.

    The uXu Textfile Writers Awards have been scratched from our plans
    because of lack of interest. Thanks to everyone who *did* take an
    interest though. Every one of you. (note the sarcasm, please).

    New files from GNN, Phearless and The Chief in this release which
    really doesn't make it that different from the last one, but it's
    still filled with nice and interesting stuff to read before the
    summer holidays hits your face. The next release will in fact be
    the summer release, so stay tuned.


    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?
    ----------------------------------------------

    Jeppers! All issues (0-###) are available from the sites listed at the
    end of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

*   A new mailing-list package is being tested right now (thanks to
*   Drunkfux), which will make it a lot easier, and more reliable than
*   before. To make sure it works, and, check that your addresses are
*   still valid (anyone out there?) a pre-release message will be sent
*   to each subscriber. More info in that message when you recieve it.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing The Chief at chief@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 003,022,054,065,023

    To subscribe, just let the Subject line of the letter contain the words
    "Add uXu", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon as it is
    ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?
    ---------------------

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. Where's the respect these days?


    Easy way to find what's new.
    ----------------------------

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are stars (or
    multiplication characters) which let you know what's new since
    last time. You don't have to read through the whole index for
    the latest info, just scan the file for the stars.


                                Vem sade att vi inte var fr†n Sverige?

                                                       The Chief / uXu


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Just call one of the boards listed at the end of this file and leave
   private mail to The Chief for further information (if needed) or to
   let us know you'd like to join. Don't hesitate! Call today!
   Internetters -> E-Mail me (check address at the end of the file).


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.

March  April  March  April  March  April  March  April  Releases 1993:

117: "The Missionary Man" by The GNN.   Our twisting-ends meister
smokes you into this eleventh release with a story only inches
away from your face. His views on life in general marks this one
as well as it does in his other work.

118: "I O U" by Phearless.   This is not for the weak. This is not
for the inexperienced one. Phearless makes a tough comback with a
story that'll make you bleed and never forget. Hard-core for the
fans out there.

119: "...As If Every Day..." by The GNN.   What can create something
so terrible, so unpredictable, that you'll face your maker even
though you're not sick, even though it's not an accident and even
though it's not suicide? Read on.

120: "Pleasurehouse Interview" by The Chief.   One of the best 
Swedish indie bands played live at a local place, and yours truly,
couldn't miss that opportunity to do an interview with the members
of the band. Something for the indie-mates out there, for sure.

121: "Perpetum Mobile - Three Poems" by The GNN.   Three poems in
a collection from The GNN. 'Ice', 'The Price To Pay' and 'Perpetum
Mobile'. Some of the best poems from uXu in fact, and not to be
missed.

122: "uXu Lyrics: Suredo, Pleasurehouse & A Shrine" by The Chief.
More lyrics! This time from the three best Swedish Indie bands
right now. Independent fans - you'll find yourself at home with
uXu.. we're sure independent.

123: "The Open Road Towards The Future" by The GNN.   Now, here
and alive. That's what you are, isn't it? Do you care about
anything? Do you value your right to live the way you do?
Questions. An answer? Why worry.

124: "Everything's Gonna Be Alright..." by Phearless.   Yes,
Phearless with another fantastic file. One that is different
from what we're used to see from him. One that is grabbing your
brain from every direction. Car-ness.

125: "They Are Coming" by The GNN.   If you heard that they were
coming, would you greet them with a smile, or would you be worried
they'd blow everyone away? You'd have to chose, you'd have to see
the reality.

126: "Why?" by The GNN.   What are you wearing? What are you doing?
Who told you to do your homework? Who even told you to got to school?
WHY are you doing all these things, when you know what you really
want to do? Why?

127: "uXu Index #11" by The Chief.   The index. The foundation to
an entire collection of text files. Isn't that nice. Hehe, kind of
self-important statement isn't it? Yeah, so forget it. As you
surely know, you find the regular sections in the index, plus new
information, general statistics and as a brief index for the index,
here are some of the sections:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of boards where to contact uXu.
