                          How to annoy an enemy
                           (or make a new one)

 There are several ways to annoy people that for one or another reason have
reasons to be disliked by you. In this file I will give some tips and ideas
on ways to do just that. Some are very simple, others are more complex, but
there should be something for every occasion.

 1)  Glue his bike to the ground.
 2)  Glue his door shut.
 3)  Plant catmint in his garden (it will be full of crazed cats).
 4)  Advertise his home number as the number to a BBS with megs of files
     for download.
 5)  Advertise for gay sex (or something) in his name.
 6)  Tell his girl/wife he is dating another.
 7)  Anonymously report him to the police for something (piracy, hacking,
     rape, possession of narcotics, anything).
 8)  Create a script to set your modem to call him up at 3 AM and hang up
     before he can pick up the phone.
 9)  Make his daughter pregnant.
10)  Order lots of stuff in his name via mail order.
11)  Steal his bills and wait until they turn of the phone, electricity and
     so on.
12)  Break into his house, phone Australia (or something) and leave the
     phone off hook.
13)  Do the same thing but reconnect his phone to a long distance BBS, then
     just call him up and you will be connected to the BBS. Why not take
     some advantages as well?...
14)  Some operating systems shut of the user if too many illegal logons are
     attempted. If your enemy has an account you could shut him off in this
     way...
15)  If he is a modem user you could call a local BBS that he has not yet
     an account on and then register in his name an be a total leech. Try
     to chat with the sysop at 3 o'clock in the morning, download lots,
     upload viruses and so on. It's even better if you do it in some
     message network, like FidoNet, UseNet or something...
16)  Infect his dog with rabies.
17)  Change lock on his door.
18)  Pour fertilizer on his front yard in form of a message, like JERK.
19)  Do the same with gasoline, ammoniac, dry ice or something. Same effect
     but in the opposite way... This effect LASTS.
20)  Put his house/apartment up as a bordello in some sex guide.
