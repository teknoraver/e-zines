     THE GNN'S FILE #100: THIS IS WHAT YOU READ, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu



                            A live performance.

                 With some help from Phearless and Hedge.



  Yes.  This is what you read and this is what you get.  Nothing can change
that  even  if you try.  However, what will be written in the future can be
changed  if  you  open your mouth and let a few creative comments pass your
lips.   Creative  comments,  flowers,  chocolate  and greeting cards can be
mailed to me at GNN@krille.update.uu.se.

  Oh,  I  forgot  to say hello and welcome to my one hundredth file for the
Underground  eXperts  United series of text files!  This is my own personal
text file and I will not do anything else than speak about myself!  Hohoho,
yeah, I know that might be boring but...

  (Audience goes:  "BOOO!")

  ...I felt that I had to expose my great ego and intelligent...

  (Audience throws empty beer bottles against the stage, *crash* )

  ...   *crash*...mind...   <Ahem>.   Now  then, *crash* since I guess this
will be quite an exciting evening *crash* *crash* for all of us, especially
YOU since you now finally have the chance to speak to me in person!  I know
that  this  is what you have wanted for years now!  (or to be more precise:
two years and five months!)
  So!  Come on people!  Tell me how much you love me and...

  (Audience laughs out loud.  Someone screams "Fuck you mister!  HAHA!")

  ...how much you...  have...  uh...  appreciated my files!  Come on people
ask me about my life!

  Audience:  "How on earth have you been able to produce so
             much SHIT during your years with uXu?"

  Right.   Shit.   Well,  I felt that the world needed my help and the best
way  to  give  them that was to write GREAT files about our society and how
the world works!  And...

  Audience:  "Thanks, we have heard enough...  How come
             you never stop?  That would make the world
             a better place to live in!"

  Better place?  BETTER PLACE?  NOW LISTEN TO ME YOU LITTLE BRAINDEAD HUMAN
BEING I AM THE ONE AND ONLY TEXT FILE WRITER ON THIS...

  (Audience laughs and brings up their shot guns)

  ...AND  I  WILL...   hey...  HEY!  Wait!  Do not shoot!  I will not write
anything more!  Trust me!  I was only kidding!  Hey!  Heey!  HEEEEEEY!

  *BANG* *BANG* *BANG*

  (Audience shouts:  "Was it good for you too GNN?!  HAW HAW HAW!")

  Gasp, gasp...  uh...  just *cough* great, thank you!  *cough*...

  (Audience leaves, leaving GNN dying on the stage)

  It  is  hard to be a writer nowadays...  first rejected by all publishers
on  planet Earth, then shot.  Thank God I gave The Chief plenty of money so
he  would  release  my  AMAZING  files!   *cough*.   People  do not seem to
appreciate  REAL  ART  nowadays!   Bah!   Lame!  Stupid!  They just want to
work, get a good-looking partner to fuck, work, go home and watch TV before
they die of cancer a few years later!
  Truly amazing...  what the...  HEY!  HEY!  OVER HERE!  HELP!

  (Three people enters the hall, looking around for GNN)

  COME  HERE!   I  am here!  Ah, finally some fans!  I knew they would show
up!  The other people must have been terrorists who works for the corrupted
state!  I knew they wanted to kill me!  OVER HERE!  *cough* *gasp*...

  "Hello there GNN!  How is everything?"

  Fine thank you..  just fine!  A few holes in my body, but I will survive!
No  problem!   Just  take me to a hospital and I will soon be able to write
again!

  (The three people steps out from the shadows)

  Oh,  it  is  you...   The Chief, Phearless and Ralph.  What are you doing
here?   Are you not supposed to...  uh...  organize some surprise-party for
me to celebrate my ONE HUNDREDTH FILE?  *ouch* *cough*

  "Well, you see...  we changed our minds!  We decided to get here and help
you away from this place instead!"

  You have always been such good friends...

  (The  Chief draws a Magnum .44 from his shoulder holster and places it in
The GNN'S mouth.)

  "You  see...   we  feel  that it is time for you to stop writing ALL THAT
SHIT THAT YOU KEEP GIVING US!"

  (Ralph and Phearless looks at each other, nodding)

  ...glomp schko kroks uh?

  (The Chief pulls the trigger)

  *BANG*

  (and again)

  *BANG*

  (and again and again and again and again)

  *BANG* *BANG* *BANG* *BANG*


                         -- MEANWHILE IN HEAVEN --

      Angel: "Ya know what?"
        God: "Nope..."
      Angel: "They just shot The GNN!"
        God: "FINALLY! I have *waited* for that to happen after I
              had read his fucking "Divine Problems" file!
              Give me the names of the killers and I will reserve
              them a place here!

        Devil: "We have a problem..."

        Devil: "Right..."

                          *  Message of the day *

           We  are  here  to talk about something serious folks...
         Ever  heard about a so called writer who names himself as
         "The  GNN"?   If there is something that irritates me, it
         must  be his stupid and tiresome novels about things that
         absolutely  no-one  cares about.  And I mean NO-one!  Who
         could  for example, sit and read something so stupid as a
         novel  concerning  a horror future in America?  Perhaps a
         slightly retarded ape of some sort...
           His  ego  must be of gigantic proportions to think that
         there  really  is any value in the shit he produces.  And
         as every writer he claims himself to be seeing the things
         we  other  cannot  see, except that all of us has already
         seen  everything  he prides himself with seeing.  He even
         tries to decorate his work with small, easily spotted and
         laughed at, sarcasms.  Can you believe this dork???  When
         he starts to write about something substantial, give me a
         call will you...?
