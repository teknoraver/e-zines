                         THE ANATOMY OF BOREDOM
                         by Ralph 124C41+/PD/uXu


                         "I'm bored!"
                             (anyone)


  Some people think that hate is a strong power, or sex, or love, or just
about anything else. But they are all wrong. What do you think is the
feeling that make us do the most? Of course it's boredom. Boredom and
frustration. It's boredom that make us get up and do something with our
lives! If we don't do anything about our boredom we get frustrated.

  It's boredom that makes people do a lot of things. Just think about all
the different activities people do in their spare time. It's just a way to
avoid being bored. People jump bungyjump, parachute, hack, phreak, love,
hate, drink, throw up, eat, dance, fuck and so on... We do a lot of things
just to keep the boredom away.

  What do you think would have happened if boredom hadn't existed? There
would probably not have been any progress in any science, poetry, art,
theatre or just about any area of human enterprise. Without boredom, would
Leonardo da Vinci constructed his machines, would Mozart have written his
music, would van Gogh have painted his paintings, would I write this file?
Probably not...

  So boredom is a strong emotion even if most of us never think about it.
Everyone feels it now and then, some people feel it more than others, some
less... But everyone is bored sometime. But you shouldn't be afraid to be
bored! Because boredom is essential for the progress of human life. It's
boredom that makes us get up and do things. If you don't do anything about
your boredom it will eventually grow to frustration and in the end crush
you. Boredom and frustration can make you kill yourself just because you
can't stand this empty feeling inside where you sit and just listen to the
ticking of your heart.

  Boredom is a strong power. It can make you do something about your life.
So get up and start combating the boredom! Remember that boredom is a
power only when it's battled!

                                BOREDOM!
