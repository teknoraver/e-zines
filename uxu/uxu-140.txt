                            "THE KILLING TRUTH"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


                   "The voice of my education said to me
                            he must be killed"
                                    (D.H. Lawrence)



         Last year, I met the most dangerous man on planet earth.
       When you looked at him he did not look  especially dangerous
       at all.  He was thin, rather short and  his eyes where tired
       as if he had never slept in  his whole life. He spoke with a
       low  dark  voice and he  never looked directly  into my eyes 
       while talking. 
         Speakers played soft piano music  around us that small pub
       downtown,  when  I  saw  him for the first time. The pub was
       almost  empty - it was just me and him there.  I do not know
       why  he  was there.  For myself, I was there to celebrate on
       my  own.  It was my twenty-fifth birthday.  I offered him my
       company  but  he said no.  To convince him, I had to buy him
       three bottles of beer before he started to talk.
         I  admit that  I wanted  his  company.  You can say that I
       bought his company  just to escape  from the loneliness.  My
       friends where gone and I felt empty.  I just  wanted someone
       to talk to.  Now I  regret  that I  went to that pub, that I
       began to talk to him.  My life would never be the same.
         I am the most dangerous man on planet earth, he said.  Let
       me  tell  you why.  Do not interrupt me.  I know the killing
       truth.    I   learned  it  six  years  ago,  after  studying
       philosophy  and  psychology.   It  is a simple truth, but it
       kills.   Listen, have any one ever asked you a question that
       you cannot answer?  Of course not. There is always an answer
       to  everything.   Maybe you do not know that answer, but you
       know  that  there  is  an  answer.   The  killing truth is a
       question  that cannot be answered and everybody know that at
       once.   You  know what I mean?  No you, do not.  But you try
       to  understand  and  that is enough.  You cannot even try to
       understand the killing truth.
         So  tell  me  that 'killing truth', I said.  Let us see if
       you are right.  I bet you are just talking crap.
         He  did  not  answer.  He just looked at me with a neutral
       face.   I  will  not  tell you, he said after a while.  If I
       tell  you,  you  will  loose  your  last  hope.   Humans are
       rational  beings  - we need hope to survive.  Animals have a
       strong  instinct  to  survive.   They do not commit suicide.
       Humans  have  an  instinct to but not so strong.  We survive
       because  half  of our mind says that we have to survive, the
       other  half  says  that  we  have  some kind of hope for the
       future.   The  killing truth removes the hope.  What is left
       is  a  weak  instinct  for  surviving.  That instinct is not
       enough.   When the hope is gone in a rational human, he will
       die.   Maybe  not  at  once,  but almost.  I am almost dead.
       Even I am not  resistant to the  killing truth.  But I never
       regret that I found it.
         He  rose from the chair.  Good bye, he said politely.  You
       will probably see  me again some day.  I know that for sure.
       Some  day,  everybody  on  this  planet will be aware of the
       killing  truth.   All humans  suck.  They  deserve  to  die.
       Some  day,  I will tell everybody the killing truth.  I will
       remove  the  last  hope from everybody, just for the sake of
       it.  Good bye.
         Oh yes,  he  was right. I saw him again and I still do. He
       talks  about  the misery of the  world and for  each new day
       that passes he looks more and more sad.
         He  is  close  to revealing the killing truth now.  I know
       that, and I am  watch  him every  day, just  waiting for it. 
       You  probably see him every day too.
         He is working at the six o'clock television news.
