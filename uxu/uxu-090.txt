  Ah, where ever you go, there they are!  "People of the Elite scene".
What makes these people interesting is that they are miles away from what
you could call a Normal social life.  They isolate themselves in their
homes, with the exception when they go to so called "parties" to have so
called "fun".
  To show you some classical examples how-to recognize a man of the scene
we have found a bunch of dialogues between a Normal Human Being (NHB) and
some ELITE-D00DDZ.
  This file can be very useful if you want to identify what kind of person
you are talking to if you happen to crash into a "copyparty" during one of
your many escapes from the cops.  Otherwise, this article is worthless.

  Please, read on.
