                           LASER HUMAN TERRORISM
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
 
   "It happened once again in Stockholm. The so called 'laserman' have
                      tried to kill a black man..." 
                                   (The Channel News, Sweden)
                      
 
  Haven't you got a lasersight? Then buy yourself one! It's incredible fun,
even if you do not own a gun. Easy to use, accurate and frightening...
Almost everybody have seen films like T2 and know what a lasersight is. 
Imagine the horror you would feel if you suddenly, one evening, discovered
a red dot on yourself or your girlfriend/dog/child/car etc etc...
 
  Yes! Here are some hints how to get maximum entertainment from your laser!
But remember; If you just play around with the sight, NEVER NEVER use it on
your gun if you do not intend to shoot someone. If you happen to get 
caught, you could be charged for many unpleasant things...
  
  The thing is simple. Aim at people and scare the fucking shit out of them.
First, you need a good place. People must be walking past it quite often,
since i guess you don't wanna sit and wait forever! And you must be able
to hide in the shadows. I recommend dark rooms and cars. If you sit in a
room, make it the second floor. You'll have a better view and you are harder
to discover. Simple. Nights and evenings are also to prefer, since the
laser is much clearer then. A fun way to spend boring nights.
 
  A) A lonely man or woman is walking on the street. It's no idea to aim
     directly at the person since he will not discover it. Aim at a 
     wall or something in front of him, and when he have discovered it let
     the red dot "walk" down on the ground and up his leg...
 
  B) Two persons are coming your way! Aim at the back on the one who is 
     first. The other dude will see a red dot on his friend/girlfriend/
     grandma/wife etc... What will happen? Most people will tell him to
     run for his fucking life, but in more extreme cases they will throw
     themselves onto the "victim" and protect him/her with his pathetic
     life... The best ones are women with small children! Would you like
     to see the head of YOUR kid explode? It can be a .44 in the other end 
     of the laserbeam! He He He.
 
  C) A crowd of people. This is good. Let the laser "walk" around on people's
     heads, there's always some "hero from Nam" who will get totally
     crazed.
 
  D) Blinking paranoia. Use the laser to create strange lights in the 
     ground that suddenly disappears. Some jerks will begin to dig in
     search for "what the hell it was"...
 
  Use your mind! There and loads and loads of good ways to scare people.
 
  I use a cheap and compact, but VERY good, lasersight with a range of 300
yards. It's called "T2" (God knows why). Manufactured and sold by TacStar
Industries INC. The price is currently $180 (May 1992).
