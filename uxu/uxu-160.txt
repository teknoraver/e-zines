*   The intro.           "Find me before I find you"

    The winter season is over us once again. Snow, exams, power failures.
    But most interesting, the christmas holidays. Gives you some time
    off to read a few uXu's by the fire, and we won't disappoint you. :)
    This release is kind of special, not to mention the last Big one
    where we had two LARGE files to distribute. Let us know what you
    thought about that one, okay? Well, this time we've added a lot of
    new contributors, who we hope will stay with us for a long time.
    Along with them, a bunch of new files which makes this package
    somewhat varied in style, but really good and should satisfy
    whatever taste you all have. We're really happy about this, and
    hope that there will be more contributions in the future. It really
    has been kinda slow on that front before this release, but now we're
    rockin'. See this package as a christmas present to you all, and
    a big thanks to everyone for staying with us these two years. Now
    we're looking forward to 1994. Let the festivities begin!


    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?

    Why not! All files (0-160) are available from the sites listed at the
    end of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 003,142,054,125,023

    To subscribe, just let the BODY of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are stars (or
    multiplication characters) which let you know what's new since
    last time. You don't have to read through the whole index for
    the latest info, just scan the file for the stars.


                                                 Merry Christmas y'all
                                                       The Chief / uXu

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.
                      Password protected files are okay too.

November  December  November  December  November  December Releases 1993:

148: "Technophilia" by Ikonoklast.   The book on the computer underground
as we know it today. If you haven't read this one already, you better
grab a copy and get a grip on the underground. Everything from Hackers
to Raves, from Mind machines and Virtual Reality to Nootropics. Grab this
one or you're crazy!

149: "The Art Of Weirdness" by Bob Slack.   This one is the first from
Bob under the uXu label. It gives you some ideas on what to do while
online someplace if you're not weird enough already. You'll get far by
following his short but useful tips.

150: "Declare War!" by The GNN.   The computer underground is a
somewhat vulnerable scene these days. People get busted every day
and, it seems, for everything. This is no longer a game like it
was a few years ago. This is war.

151: "Hackers Against The Govt's New World Order" by FreeStyle.   One
of our new contributors presents you with a in-depth discussion on
what the government is really all about. Control. And what can we do
about it? The computer underground can't do shit, you say? Wrong.
Read on.

152: "Settle For Nothing" by The Chief.   The topic of large egos
once again. More in a general view of relationships this time though
and how to act/what to do (perhaps) to make that relationship hold
or fold. You decide if you want to try. I wouldn't.

153: "A Day For Tired People" by The GNN.   Feeling tired and bored
on sundays huh? Feeling like you're doing everything like you've always
done it, without change? Well, here's a little story for you that'll
probably make you think a bit. No no, it's fiction. :)

154: "Suicidal Maniac's Shitty File" by Suicidal Maniac.   Now here's
someone who promised us a file _a long_ time ago. And you know what?
He kept his promise! Even though he disappeared from the online world
for almost a year. Amazing. Well, what are you waiting for? Get it!

155: "Ripmax Top Tenners" by Ripmax.   Yes yes, another load of top
ten files, though this time from a new australian contributor. How to
piss off people listening in on your phone line, and how to cause
havoc at the shopping mall. Good stuff to have in mind when shit
happens to you, no? Yes.

156: "The Sad Part Of Raping" by Hedge.   A story that'll leave you
with more questions than answers. There are not much to say about
it, other than that it is a chilly story with blood stains on it.
Brrrrrrr.

157: "uXu Lyrics: Slowdive - Souvlaki" by The Chief.   At last, the
lyrics to the latest album from Slowdive. Trickier than ever, but
most of it is what it should be. Straight forward - Slowdive lyrics
are _tough_, but this'll help you on your way to enlightenment.

158: "Exciting Life" by The GNN.   What do you want from life? Do you
feel that urge to _do_ something? To become _someone_? To stand out
in a crowd. Be special. That would be great, wouldn't it? You'd be
doing what you wanted to do, all the time, right? Right...

159: "Advanced Phreaking Using Cordless Phones" by FreeStyle.   There
are ways you can use a cordless phone. There are ways you can use it
to your advantage. There are ways people can use Your cordless phone
to Your disadvantage. Now, do you want to miss this file?

160: "uXu Index #14" by The Chief.   Hmm, no comments on if the index
is needed or not since last time. Well, I guess it'll stay this way
then, 'til someone says something about it. <g>. This time the index
contains _New and improved_ information, general statistics and, of
course, a couple of those sections are listed neatly and well below,
only for you:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks and Honorary Member List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact uXu.

      [#160 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
