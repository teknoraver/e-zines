                The revenge is sweeter than a cold sorbet!"
                                    - Colonel Sponz


  He sat in a four-cornered room staring at candles.  Without focusing, his
eyes  kept  looking right into the flickering light, and you could see that
he  was  concentrating  on  keeping  them that way.  The silence was almost
unbearable,  you  could  occasionally  hear  the  low  thunder of airplanes
passing,  but  aside  from  that,  numbing silence.  Who knows what went on
inside  his  head at that time.  God knows he had a lot to think about, but
it  seemed  he needed to get it together, to sort the bad from the worse so
to  speak.   It  all  had  happened so fast.  Only a few hours earlier this
place  had  been his apartment, but now it came closer to a pile of garbage
in resemblance.

  The  police  had  done a thorough job.  He hadn't even had time to switch
off the equipment after his last visit in the Network, before they had come
crashing  into  the  apartment.   The only remainder of that there once had
been  a  computer  there  was  a black power cord dangling from a back of a
chair.  Somehow they must have forgotten it, he thought, not looking at it.
He  kept  his  eyes  concentrated  on  the  candles.   Somehow  you got the
impression  that  he  wasn't  ready  to deal with the destruction just yet.
Knowing was enough, seeing it could perhaps only make things worse.

  They  had  come.  Everything which could possible (in their minds) have a
value  in  their  investigation  they  had taken.  He had a faint memory of
someone  speaking  to him during all this, but no matter how hard he tried,
he could not remember the words.  All he could recall was floorboards being
broken  up, plates smashed and other pieces of furniture being destroyed in
their  "search".   They  even  broke  his  only  source  of light, the lamp
dangling  from  the  ceiling.   He  mildly  wondered what on earth they had
expected  to  find in a light bulb.  The only thing of interest they hadn't
found  was now on the table in front of him, beside the candles.  The thing
was  a  Glock 17.  He had stolen it during his military service and had had
many  enjoying  experiences with it since.  Although he lacked a permit for
it,  there  was usually never any problems in getting hold of ammunition to
it.   Most of the time, it was only a few phone calls away.  He had kept it
well hidden under a fake floor in one of his closets, and the police hadn't
been  able  to  find  it.  It was loaded, and lay there beside the candles,
gleaming.

  Beside  the gun lay a receipt with a phone number on it.  He knew it went
to  the  chief  prosecutor of this investigation, and before he sat down in
front  of  the  candles, he had managed to get hold of the prosecutors name
and address.  He still had some friends he thought slowly.  Even if some of
those  he  earlier  considered  to  be  his friends had cooperated with the
police  and  told  them  all  they  knew about him.  Just to save their own
asses!  He had their names as well...

  You  could  feel  the  atmosphere  in the room change as the man suddenly
stood  up  and  looked  at  what  was  left  of his apartment.  It was like
something  had  came  clear  to  him,  and that he knew.  You could see the
difference  in his eyes as well.  Gone was the shocked thousand yard stare.
It  had  been  replaced by a confident look which knew what was to be done,
and  how  to  do  it.  He grabbed the gun, cocked it and headed towards the
door.   Beside the door he stopped and put on his black leather jacket, and
let the gun slide down in one of its big pockets.  As he stepped out in the
dark  autumn  night he could hear the noise of the big city clearly through
the brisk cold air.  He stood there for a while breathing.  He then started
the  short  walk towards the subway station where a train would take him to
the city.

  The  only  thing he could think of as he slowly descended down the stairs
into the underground was some addresses he somehow had gotten hold of...
