                     "Death can take a thousand faces
                      they all look familiar to me
                      I live in a world of paradox
                      my willingness to destroy
                      is you chance for improvement
                      my hate is your faith
                      my failure is your victory
                      a victory that won't last"
                                             
  

  After  two hours in Moscow I knew that they were on their way to kill me.
Someone  pulled  a  deadly  joke on me as I entered the American border - a
fake  message  in  my  passport  that  said  that I was a spy who wanted to
defect.   I killed two police men and dug my grave.  They got me where they
wanted  me  to  be.   To evade the problem I travelled to the South African
Alfa  Base,  but  I was already known there too.  I was a real enemy of the
state.   I had killed two police men - the worst crime available.  But even
if  I  had not killed them,  they would have gotten me anyway.  They wanted
me dead. I got myself a fake ID card and could remain anonymous.
  I  returned to America two years later.  It felt good to breathe cool air
and  see  green  mountains.   My  last  friend gave me a fake account and I
logged  into  the major computer systems.  I managed to see that they still
wanted me dead.  My name was attached with a rumor that said that I enjoyed
eating  humans.  I used a chair to break the window before I jumped out.  A
few  seconds  later a helicopter, that emerged from nowhere, blew the whole
house  to  pieces.   I  went back to the South African Alfa Base.  My false
ID-card still worked.   After  two days they found my new name and tried to
trace me once again.  I had to kill yet another police man and one innocent
individual to get a new card.
  That  day,  two years ago in Moscow, I said the truth.  The truth was too
much  for  the State, so  they  made  me an enemy.  I had not committed any
public  crimes,  I had just told the truth.  So they placed that message in
my passport and made me a public enemy of the world.
  A  fugitive.  My life changed into a life of running and hiding.  Killing
was  my work and I still do it very good.  They know that they will have to
kill  me to get me.  My words of truth did not help me, or the world, much.
After  I  had  spoken them, they exterminated all of the audience, and used
computers  to  change  the  interview with me before they broadcasted it on
television.   The  last  problem  was me.  I escaped from the studio when I
knew  what  was  going  on.  To kill me on a public street was to risky, so
they had to transform me into a criminal.  Of course, they succeeded.
  The gun shots still echoes in my head.
  Are  you  able to follow the Red Team?  they asked me.  At that time, the
answer was obvious.  Yes, I am able to follow the Red Team.
  Now  I  do  not  know.   I  am  a robot.  A robot made to kill people who
dislike the people I am supposed to work for.
  I  work  for  the  State.   The  State  rules supreme sometimes.  But not
always.  People hate the State, and would do anything to release themselves
from  the chains.  Therefor they created machines like me.  Machines, ready
to  kill  people  without asking why.  Kill him, they said and I would kill
that  individual.   Of course, no one knew who killed.  I made it look like
accidents, suicide or murder.  Anything, that could not be connected to the
State.  My State.
  The  people,  or  should  I  say  machines,  of the Red Team used to call
themselves Slaves of the Big Brother.
  Then it happened.  I asked myself why?
  Why kill?  Who are the State?  Why should I kill for them?  My electronic
brain  works  logical.  The answer came to me in less than one nano-second.
I  kill  because.   Because  of  what?   No answer.  A analyzed my data and
understood.   I  kill, because other people want to live.  If I continue, I
would  die too.  The State controls everything, including me.  I had to get
rid  of that control.  That is why I said yes to that interview.  A russian
girl  called  me  up  while  I  was  in  Moscow  and  asked me to join in a
television  program.   Tell  the  world  about  yourself,  she said.  I was
supposed  to  accept,  tell  the  world  about my work as a employee of the
State.   My  work,  as  I  was  supposed to lie, was to help people.  But I
changed  my  mind.   Live  on  television,  I said that my work was to kill
everybody  who  disliked the State.  My life was not worth anything.  I was
not  a  member  of  the Red Team any more.  The Red Team are robots who are
programmed to kill.
  I  tried  to  hide  myself  in  the ghetto of the big city.  It was hard.
Killers, programmed with the color of my eyes and brain waves, searched and
found me.  They were not as good as me to kill.
  I  am  the  Dare  Devil, a former member of the Red Team.  My task was to
kill,  your  fear  was my advantage.  Who am I now?  I am nothing.  A prey,
ready to be killed by fresh members of the Red Team.
  Are  you ready to join the Red Team?  Say no, and you are dead.  Say yes,
and  you  kill.  Take your time, lock your target and strike.  Work for the
corrupted State, it is well paid these days.
  I  check  my  watch.  It is half past seven in the morning.  This is just
another  day for you.  For me, it will be yet another struggle between life
and  death.   We live in the brave new world.  The Red Team has been active
for many years.
  The  Red  Team  still  kills people.  Soon, it will be my turn to die.  I
cannot hide forever.  I suddenly remember my first kill.  He was an author.
His book was named Nineteen Eighty Four.  I was a slave for the big brother
and it was just a job.
  I check my internal watch again.  The year is one nine nine four, and who
will be able to follow the Red Team this year?
