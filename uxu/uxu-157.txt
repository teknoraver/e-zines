  Souvlaki, Slowdive's third album (if you count 'Blue Day'). Well, it was
  *not* easy to hear Rachel and Neil on this one either. :) Thanks to Pippin
  for his help with this one! Let's knife...



@SONG: Alison

Listen close, sit down [...]
I'll be here in the morning
'Cause I'm just floating

Your cigarette still burns
Your messed-up world will thrill me
Alison, I'm lost

Alison, I said we're sinking
There's nothing here but that's okay
Outside your room, your only sister's spinning
But your eyes, tells me she's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere

And the sailors they strike poses
TV covered walls, and so slowly
With your talking and your pills
Your messed-up life still thrills me
Alison, I'm lost

Alison, I'll drink your wine
I wear your clothes, when we're both fine
Alison, I said we're sinking
But you laugh and tells me it's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere



@SONG: Machine Gun

They're walking and I know, she's my friend, again
Just the way that the water, drags me down, again
Please don't think I'm a [...] it's my friend, oh yeah
It's just the way that the water, makes me feel, again

Saw machine gun
I saw you down
Saw the arrow
I slow you down
It is all I need, yeah

They're walking and I know she's my friend, again
Just the way that the water, drags me down, again
Please don't think I'm a [...] it's my friend, oh yeah
It's just the way that the water, makes me feel, again

Saw machine gun
I saw you down
Saw the arrow
I slow you down
It is all I need, yeah




@SONG: 40 Days

Fourty days and I miss you
I'm so high that I've lost my mind
It's the summer I'm thinking of
Fourty days and I'm blown away

If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care

You said you're always sleeping
But if so, I'll be leaving
It's just that I'm always falling
And it makes me feel bad, yeah

If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care

Just to try and watch you
Said I love the way that you smile, don't
Makes me try and watch you
I said I love the way that you smile, don't
Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile, don't
Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile, don't



@SONG: Sing

Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Here come my man
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
Here in my mind
Watch you fall away
I know
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
See you cover death
I know

We're fine, you are blind
Caught it from behind
Feel you fall away
I know he's here to stay
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance

Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
[...]
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
What a world I [...]
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
I thought I [...]
Everything I say
[...]
Sing where the other boys can watch you dance
[...]
[...]
And I know that he's gone away




@SONG: Here She Comes

It's so lonely in this place
So cold I don't believe

And as no-one knows my name
It's easy to pretend
It's easy to believe

There's a shadow on my wall
It dances like my soul
Dances like my soul

It's so cold now
I swear it will be warm
Here she come now




@SONG: Souvlaki Space Station

Call the skies [...]
See it work, the [...]
[...] that I call you
Wonder why I can hear you

It's time [...]
Do you see
It's time for [...]
Do you see

[...]
[...]
Picture, cannot find you
Wonder why I can see you

[...]
[...]
[...]
[...] now I [...]




@SONG: When The Sun Hits

Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me

My game, please don't leave me
Come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With the coffins, under heaven
Hey hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song yeah (BV: hey hey)

Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me

My game, don't lose me
Come so far don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With the coffins, under heaven
Hey hey lover, you're still burning
You're his song yeah (BV: hey hey)

Sweet thing I watch you (BV: burn away) [repeat 3]


 
@SONG: Altogether

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sleepyhead where did you go
I saw you turning, but I couldn't catch your eye
It's alright, we're altogether
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And now seems just a dream
It broke my heart, but then I guess you didn't know
It's allright, we're altogether
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So tired
You're so right
I'm so tired
It's alright tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sleepyhead what did you know
I saw you talking but I didn't hear a word
It's alright, we're altogether
Yeah, yeah



 
@SONG: Melon Yellow

Sitting by and watch you fall away
Sudden fall, watched you for a day
You know I don't believe in death
Follow the sun, watch you flow [...]

Sitting here and watch the death
Looking for the sun and watch the death

So long, so long
It's just a way to [...love...] you
So long, so long
It's just a way to [...love...] you

I saw you looking at the sun
I saw you looking at the sun
So long, so long        [repeat 5]
It's just a way to [...] you [repeat 5]



@SONG: Dagger

The sunshine girl is sleeping
She falls and dreams alone
And me I am her dagger
To numb to feel her pain

The world is full of noise yeah
I hear it all the time
And me I am your dagger
You know I am your world
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time

She whispers while I'm sleeping
I love you when you smile
I didn't really lose you
I just lost it for a while

The world is full of noise yeah
I hear it all the time
You know I am your dagger
You know I am your wound
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
