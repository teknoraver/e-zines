                              THE SERIOUS SERIES

                                 CHAPTER TWO

         "All of a sudden, I found myself in love with the world..."
                                                 -Ministry



  Five years. It had only been five years since Conrad J Coppacio founded
Coppacio Corp and built the pyramid. Seemed like a lifetime. Government
officials had been bought, one after the other, only to be replaced by CC
executives. Two months. Then, there was no difference between the Coppacio
board of directors and the government.

  By the time the colonization of Corp Zone and Roundgaarden started,
Coppacio owned it all. Owned everything. The other corporations, the police
force, the military, the space colonies. Right down to the people themselves,
and no-one had noticed. Two years after the pyramid was finished, Coppacio
sealed off the lower floors. Crime, they claimed, had caused the change.
Granted, the crime rate on Floor 1 had climbed to an alarming rate, but
everyone knew that that wasn't the reason behind it. No one said anything
at the time. Who'd argue with those who owned you? The CC then abandoned
Floor 1, left everything. The old computer terminals, the machines, the
works. One day, it was all gone. The CC logo, the only thing left that
reminded them of what had once been there. Making it the prison it resembled
today. Today, the black blocks, the lower floors, kept the citizens where
they were. Leaving the only way out of MegaCity through the upper floors.

  Pain. Fire burning where it hurts the most. A moment of silence, a touch of
cold hands, then.. nothing. Sharp sticks made out of crystal and patched with
silicon trodes found their way down Castle's scarred back. Found the second
spot, then, more pain. Jaqueline Briskin. He watched her as he rose from the
stretcher. Her tiny, well-placed nose, her green custom made eyes and high
cheek-bones together with her long reddish hair made her look like a doll.
A good cover. Jaqueline Briskin, who worked the streets, though not as a whore,
but as one of the best, and most hired, implant surgeons on Floor 1.
  'That'll take care of it,' she said, placing the sticks neatly back into the
black whizzing plastic module with artistic movement.
  'It better.'
  Explosions, with fifteen second intervals, shook the foundation of the
building, shattering the cement that hid the steel underneath, still screaming
with pain from unknown hours of torture. A corporate intercom voice announced
the well known and disbelieved Coppacio Corp. information about "scientific
experiments that had to be done, the underground atomized explosions were
merely a troublesome, but harmless side-effect. No need for alarm. I repeat,
no need for alarm."
  'If it don't, you're dead, Castle. Pause. 'You know,' she sighed, 'it will
only work for another week, then you'll have to come back for a complete
re-scan again. Another treatment.'
  'Yeah..' Castle said reaching for his shirt. 'But it's worth it.'
  'They'll find out. Sooner or later, they'll know. You don't screw Them
and get away with it. You don't change your P-Scan code unless you really,
and I mean REALLY have to.' Jaqueline looked at him with serious eyes.
'Oh, I've told you before, and I know you pay me good money for this, but..'
  Silence.
  'When they know, they know,' he said. 'You must understand. This is 
something I have to do without them knowing it. I have to go places,
I have to talk to people. I have to do certain things, and they mustn't
know about it.' He shrugged. 'This is the only way.'
  Silence.
  'I've fucked them before, and I can fuck them again. Don't worry about it.
Anyways, I owe you one,' Castle said, looking at her troubled face.
  'You owe me plenty!' She walked around in the small, crummy basement,
touching the torn walls here and there where cracks had grown into holes.
'But there's only one thing I want from you, Castle,' she said, opening
the door to let him out, 'and that is to have you back here again, in
seven days. In one piece.'
  Castle smiled and took her hand.

  Stairs. The street. Stirring with life, and yet so full of death. It
rained. Two Human Carbon Copy whores winked at Castle as he emerged from
the cellar, crossing the street. No time, he thought. He had seven days to
do what ordinarily would have taken him six months. Five minutes later, he
had the amount of Pentaminehexadiamyl that would take him through the week.
That would keep him alive on the street. Thunder smashed the black skies,
tearing the rain apart in large quantities. Blue-gray search beams wandered
the alleys from above. Gun-shots somewhere down one of them. Screams.

  Back at the apartment, he noticed the IML still flashing. Hadn't checked
the messages. Thrifleman had interrupted. Thrifleman with his threats, with
the assignment. He picked up the dossier and looked through the pictures again
while turning on the IML. They looked so innocent, he thought. Who would
ever believe that...
  'Castle, we need to talk.'
  A scrambled picture on the IML. Someone didn't want to be known.
  'They're breathing down my neck. I have the information, but I can't
give it to you over the line, y'know.'
  Chen. It was Chen.
  'Meet me at Paulie's, eight thir..'
  Snow on the screen. An eerie sound through the speaker. Damn! Why hadn't
he checked the messages?! Why.. He never finished the thought. Another
message came up on the screen. Thrifleman.
  'I'm not sure what your game is, Castle, but you won't get away with
it. You weren't there when we came to pick you up, and you know what
we said about that.'
  Castle picked up his gun and three magazine clips, throwing them
together with some clothes and electronics he thought he might need
into a small colorless bag.
  'Well, tell you what. I'll be a nice guy, Castle,' he continued, 'If you
report to me within the next twenty four hours, I'll forget about it, okay?'
  A hideous grin on the screen, and then, the CC logo.
  Click.
  He didn't touch anything.

  Two minutes later, he was on the street. Just in time to see his
apartment, along with two thirds of the building, explode in a flash of
red, green and blue. Large pieces of metal and stone, falling down the
47 floors to the street smashed whatever had been there before into
juice. Flesh and blood. Screams, sirens, beams of gray and blue. Run.
Away. He had to hide. Pinching one of the black derms against his wrist,
to release the drug into his veins, he managed to make his way through
the relentless crowd.

  Alley. Dark. Hiding place. Down the four steps and to the right.
He took the first hit. Swaying in the darker areas. A numb feeling spreading
through his body. Someone asked him about directions, but he didn't answer.
He watched a couple of street girls trying to find a job that'd help them
through the night, but he never saw the outcome of the event. Suddenly he
stumbled into Jake in front of 'Selectronics. Jake seemed to ask him about
a delivery he was supposed to have made, but Castle dismissed the accusations
about the delay with something about his grandmother. Castle didn't think
Jake would question that, and he was right. They made another deal, and
Castle promised he'd deliver within two weeks. Three thousand kee's of
Mendiathyl - he didn't know how to, but it was easier to make a promise
than to stand arguing the whole evening. Anyway, Jake was kind of a
friend, and you never let friends down. Not in this world. You treasured
friends more than mutagens.

  Ten million years of anger screamed through the city's veins. Ten million
years of insanity. The years of mankind. Castle felt every one of them through
his body, trying to scratch the skin off his body. Then another feeling spread
along his back. A tingling feeling. Searching. They were after him, in a bad
way too. They didn't even bother to hide it - people around him looked as if
they were dying. They had hit the P-Scan, hard. Castle knew, even his oldest
and most trustworthy friends would gladly hand him over to the CC after this
treatment. The scan would never find him though. Question was, if they'd
continue the unshielded scanning after they realized he'd changed his codes.
He had to take the chance. Had to trust Jake not to tell, to handle the pain.
He left him laying on the ground, no time to help. Anyway, there was nothing
he could do.

  When he saw Paulie's further down the alley, something told him not to go
there. A feeling of uncertainty. Two steps and the bullet hit his shoulder.
Head hit the ground. Screams again, three CCV's appeared right above,
searchlights nailing him down. It was as bright as a 20th century day.

  Castle Chronicles, the sequel, is not continuing the *first* set of chapters
  in the first chronicles. This is the serious series, based in a not so-far
  future, taking over where the not yet finished Castle Chronicles series will
  end. These two series will co-exist for a couple of chapters. Finally there
  will be a link between the finished first Chronicles and the sequel, which
  will tie them together. You will not miss anything by not reading the first
  series, but you won't get the overall picture when the two links together.
  Be on the safe side, check out the first chronicles if you haven't already.
  Take a ride with Castle's humorous side before embarking on the black, real
  and scattered future of MegaCity.                - uXu Mania 1993 -
