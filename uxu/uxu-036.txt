    Another month have passed, and even a couple of extra weeks too.
    We're sorry that we didn't manage to keep the monthly release schedule
    but like we have said, we don't follow any lines, schedules or rules,
    we just write the files, and then when we have a bunch, we release
    them to an unsuspecting audience.

    Well, that's enough about that. We're here again, with two new
    members, and a more precise distribution board list. Please welcome
    Mister Monochrome and Big A, our newest members. Mister Monochrome
    really is our first U.S. member, and it's a pleasure having him
    with us. Big A is yet another Swede, who will share his views on
    the academical level of society, life and living.

    The Support Board List has finally been made, and we have three great,
    fine, and well-sorted boards with us. Big thanks to the SysOps who
    have made their boards available to us. Thanks also goes to Dispater,
    who have made the new Phrack to what it was before, and for taking an
    interest in uXu.

    I know there are a lot of people out there who have contacted me,
    about becoming contributors, having their BBSs included in the
    distribution site list and so on who aren't mentioned here. The reason
    for that is one of these:

            1) You haven't written anything yet for uXu and therefor
               we can't list you as a contributor/member.

            2) We haven't been able to logon at your board. Mostly
               a password has been requested, which we haven't
               received, or the BBS didn't answer when we called.

     Still, if you want to be a contributor/member, please contact me at
     one of the boards at the end of this file for further information.
     And if you already know that you want to write for/with us, please
     include the file(s) you want us to publish. It is a lot easier for
     us, and you will be added to the member/contributor list right away.
     If you want your board to become a Distribution site, please include
     the Phone-no, NUP/Password (if any) and the name of the board.

                            Thanks and Merry X-Mas to everyone out there!

November  December  November  December  November  December  Releases 1991:

027: "The Ten Most Wanted By Interpol" by The GNN.   Who
could it be? This list gives you not only their names, but
also some background information. This is the start file for
yet another series, so don't miss out on the Introduction!

028: "The BIG System Vol.2 (Chapters 11-15)" by The Chief.  
Yes, the Big system is back, and heads right for outer space
just when you thought everything was safe. Spingleman gets
a new assignment, and our 'hero' finally meets the lovely
Megan. Not to be missed!

029: "Information Terrorism (At School)" by The GNN.   Why just
sit and learn from the teachers at school? Why not make a little
prank to lighten up the atmosphere a bit? The GNN gives you an
example on what to do.

030: "Unleashed - Where No Life Dwells Lyrics" by Mister Monochrome.
The dark lyrics of Unleashed re-written by our newest member,
and it is, of course, his first file for uXu, so bring home 
this soon-to-be uXu classic.

031: "The Truth" by The GNN.   We give you THE Truth here. Plain
and simple. If you don't recognize yourself when reading this
one, we want you to write for uXu, right now.

032: "Castle Chronicles Chapter Two" by The Chief.   Castle is
back once again, only to make a fool out of himself. The story
continues after he (embarrassing enough) passed out in the
previous chapter.

033: "uXu Follow-Up #1 - Dr. Ripco & Ripco BBS" by The Chief.
A large compilation of facts about the confiscation of Ripco BBS
and Dr. Ripco. Starting from the day it happened and going through
all the way until the date we have today (December 1991). Also
includes an 'interview' with Dr. Ripco, conducted in November/
December with some updates and views on what really happened.

034: "The Truth About Women" by The GNN.   The GNN reveals what
women really want from men, why they torture them, and how you
can make the best of the situation. Parental Guidance.

035: "Wpoeiwop" by The Chief.   What's THAT?, you may ask. Well I
really can't tell you right now, but it isn't something you'll
need, want, use, or drink. I won't give you any more clues at this
moment. Straight up, it's the 35th file from uXu.

036: "uXu Index #3" by The Chief.   The third index for them neat
uXu files. As always, the index includes all uXu releases in Short
format, and the new files in the Long format, as well as comments
by The Chief about what's happened since the last release, member,
contributor and support board lists, and of course, an updated list
of boards where to contact us.


             [#36 also includes an Index for the uXu-S series]
