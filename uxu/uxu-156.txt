              "I've got to get to you first, before they do"
                                        -  Depeche Mode


     The  night  was  cold  and damp from moisture.  You could hear the
   faint sound of the leaves as they moved in the passing wind.  It was
   like they made a last desperate attempt to cling on to life.

     Someone else was also trying to do the same it seemed.   According
   to the screams from the young woman somewhere here in the park, that
   was just  what  she was  trying  to do.  I  laughed  quietly  to her
   hopeless attempts to  call for help.  Its no-one here at  this time,
   I thought  for  myself.  You  should  have listened  to your mothers
   warnings...   Well anyway, I wondered who he was, if He indeed was a
   he,  that  made  his day on the poor girl.  Probably another one who
   has  discovered  that  its  just what they deserve.  Fucking whores!
   Being out this time of the night she really had it coming to her.

     Judging from the sounds he had stopped beating her, or whatever he
   had  done  before,  and started the fun part of the assault.  He was
   enjoying  every  bit  of it, at least that was what it sounded like.
   The  girl  was quiet now.  Only his grunting could be heard over the
   breeze.   Has  he  killed  her  yet, I wondered.  Then I came to the
   conclusion that he probably hadn't, it is  nothing funny in screwing
   a corpse.  At least that was what I thought.

     What  had  made  this  girl  pass  through  the park at this hour?
   Perhaps a quarrel with her boyfriend made her decide to walk home...
   Well  ,  she  sure  regretted  it  now I can tell you!  Whatever her
   reasons  had  been  they  must seem quite insignificant now.  He had
   started  to  hit her again, so I guess he had done what he came for.
   Only  the  messy  part  left  for  him  to  finish now.  Oh, how she
   screamed!  Lucky  for him that there were no police officers here at
   this  hour,  they had been withdrawn due to the risks.  Couldn't she
   stop  screaming?  He had to hit her harder, much harder so she would
   shut up.

     All  of  a  sudden a sharp crack sounded accompanied by a gurgling
   noise.   I laughed at the top of my lungs, he had broke her neck, he
   had  broke  her  neck!!!   Whoever  the guy was, he sure knew how to
   treat  a lady! I couldn't stop laughing at his brutality.  Must have
   done  this  many  times  before,  I  thought  giggling in amusement.
   Suddenly a cold rush went down my back as I began to realize who the
   girl  was.   A  moment  before  he  snapped  her  neck  I  thought I
   recognized  her  voice.   Now  I  realized  I did!  The girls scream
   resembled  in  every  bit  the  one  of  my  girlfriend.   It was my
   girlfriend!  She had been beautiful before, but not anymore...

     Who was the guy who had done this?

     It was none other than myself...
