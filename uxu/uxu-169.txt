            "True love will only exist between virtuous people"
                                           (Aristotle)


  Mmm.   She  was  there.  Just lying there on the empty beach, letting her
body  being  colored  bronze  by  the hot sun in the sky.  She was naked as
usual and from above he could see every inch of her through his binoculars.
  She is mine, he thought.  Only mine.
  William  did not really know if he was obsessed with her, or if he was on
his way to become. Whatever he was, he had almost made it into a routine to
climb  the  huge  rock  that was beside that small empty beach.  Well, that
almost  empty beach.  She was there.  Every day, she was there.  Every day,
she  was  on her back on that blanket, eating the sun, swallowing it to the
extreme.   And  every day William climbed the huge rock with the binoculars
hanging  around his neck, to watch her.  To watch her beautiful naked body.
William  had always  believed  that he was the only one who knew about this
small  secret  beach.   But  now she was there.  Alone.  Beautiful.  Naked.
Alone.   She  was a proud owner of a sweet face and a long golden hair that
slowly  moved  in  the  light  breeze.  The many big rocks around the beach
looked  like  they protected her against the sea that plunged blue waves up
on  the  beach,  as  if  it tried  to reach  out and take her.  William had
talked to her.  Three times.  Three wonderful times.
  He remembered the first time.

  "What  the...   Hey?   HEY!  Yeah!  You!", she screamed.  At first he did
not  really  understand  if  she meant him.  Did she see him?  But then she
wrapped  the  blanket around herself and pointed at him on the rock.  Shit.
"You fucking pervert!  Go away or I will call the police and get you busted
for peeping, you motherfucker!".
  William  immediately  stumbled to his feet and ran away.  He tripped on a
stone  and  almost  fell off the rock.  His binoculars were crushed against
the hard surface.  He left the pieces and climbed down.  She had not walked
around  the  rock to meet him, thank god.  He quickly ran to his house.  He
felt  strange  when  he  sat  in his living room and thought about what had
happened.  Did she not like him?  He had just admired her.  Damn.  The next
day, he bought another pair of binoculars.

  Mmm.   Even  if  she had screamed at him, he still could not resist to go
back  several  times  and  watch  her.  Oh,  she  was  beautiful!   William
watched  her  all over and saw everything.  Everything.  But he had to keep
his distance.
  William remembered the second time she spoke to him.

  It  had  been  yet another day of watching.  But something inside him had
told him to go down.  Talk to her, the voice said.  Go down, do not be such
a  coward.   She  does  not know that it was you who looked at her when she
discovered you on the rock.  Come on, do it.
  He did it.  He left the binoculars on the rock and climbed down.  Slowly,
very  slowly,  he  walked  around the rock.  He felt the heat from the sand
burning his bare feets.  Then nothing happened.  He just stood there, fifty
yards  away  from  her and could not move.  His heart jumped up and down in
his  chest.   What am I going to say, he thought to himself.  What the fuck
am I going to say.
  She  moved.  She turned around.  She saw him.  "Fuck off!".  He ran away.
When he once again sat in the living room he remembered that his binoculars
was left on the rock.  They were probably stolen by now.  He bought another
pair.  When he returned to the rock the next day, the binoculars were still
there.  But he did not mind.  She was worth every cent he had to spend.

  William chuckled  to himself as he remembered these incidents.  He looked
through  the  binoculars  again  and  watched  her.   He  could see it all.
Everything,  even...   But  he  had  to  keep the distance.  He had made an
agreement  the third time he spoke to her.  He had to keep the stand.  Stay
here,  keep  the  stand  and  accept the wall between the two of them.  She
would  lie there, and he would watch her.  That was the agreement.
  William remembered the third time she spoke to him.

  Or  maybe  she  did  not  really  speak  to  him.  It was he who  did the
talking.   He  talked  and  explained  that  he loved her, that he would do
everything  for her, if she just accepted that he watched her.  That was no
problem.   William  felt glad when he left her.  She had accepted his love,
with  a  smile.  Yes, with a smile!  She had nodded and said that it was no
problem!  Now he could watch her all the time and she would not become mad.

  William  looked at the sky.  Not a goddamn cloud.  The sun shined without
mercy on him.  She was lucky, she had all those magic creams that keeps the
sun  away  from damaging the skin.  William looked down from the rock.  She
was  still  there,  she had not gone home yet.  He picked up the binoculars
and watched her again.  Then he went home.
  The  next  day,  rain fell like small spikes from the sky.  She was there
anyway.   Naked.   But  this time she was not alone.  A crowd of people had
gathered  around  her  body.   A  police  man  bent down over her and wrote
something  on  a  paper.   More  people, probably other police men in plain
clothes  took  photographs  and  collected her belongings in bags.  William
felt  bad.   What  had happened?  What the fuck had happened?  He knew that
they  soon  would  place  her beautiful naked body into a bag and carry her
away.  He had to take a last look.
  Mmm.  William could see it all.  Everything.  The binoculars were superb.
He  saw everything.  Everything.  Even the marks on her throat made by the
piano wire that he had used when he strangled her.
