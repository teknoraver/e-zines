                   "We are about to go all systems out"

  Nothing  matters  to  me  any more.  Behind my dark glasses I can see the
world  in  a complete new vision.  Life, death, love - they are only words.
My  black  suit  fits me alright.  The mirror shows me - or maybe not.  The
person  in front if me is a welcomed stranger.  An individual who has lived
inside me all the time and now finally got the chance to live.
  Live.   Live  forever.   Childish  thoughts.  No one can live forever but
everybody  believes that they will.  Fuck them.  Fuck  all who imagine that
they are something special.
  The  gun  is  placed  in a holster on my right.  It is not visible, it is
hidden  under my wonderful black suit.  The face is smiling.  It is me - or
maybe  not.   We  are about to go all systems out.  Turn off the switch and
everything goes black.  Sleep...

        - I see...
        - We can offer you help and support.
        - No thanks, I think I can handle this myself.
        - Are you sure?  Please let us help you.

  - Get out of the car, bitch!
  She looks at me  with  her mouth open.  She wants to  scream but does not
dare to.  I grab her  and drag  her out of  the car.  She falls  to the wet
asphalt, still  with her  mouth open.  I  get into the car.  It is  a small
japanese  shit vehicle,  made  to fool  all the customers  in this country.
Fuck them.  The headlights  throws  away  a  cold  rug over the street as I
roar away in the night.  I watch the girl get to her feet behind me and run
away.
  She  had  no  reason to fear.  I am not cruel.  I still have feelings for
beauty in this world.  Others should fear.
  But  how  could  they?  I have not warned them.  I will not either.  They
just have to accept what is coming to them.  It is coming real fast.
  I  have a long journey in front of me.  It does not bother me, it will be
a pleasure.  Father time is on my side.  God will help me get justified.

        - Time is short.
        - I know.
        - Please, let us help you.  There are professional...
        - No.  No way!

  The night is clear.  Small rain drops are crushed against the windscreen.
They do not make up any dreams.  They fall and disappear, and when they are
gone  -  no  one  remembers them.  There are billions of them.  For a short
time they live, then they are gone.  Gone!  As if nothing happened.
  Religion,  media,  politics...  Ha!  Let them  live in their dreams.  Let
them  believe  that  they are creating something.  I will create, I will do
what I want to do.
  Look  at  those  shadows that walk around us!  They float around, with no
goal  (correction:   with no REAL goal).  They exist, then suddenly they do
not  any  more!   What  a surprise!  Hey, they scream.  Hey!  What about my
goals?  What about my LIFE?  I had so much to do, I had everything in front
of  me!   What  now?   This cannot be true!  Something is really fucked up!
Help me!
  No  one listens.  Why would they?  The shadows have other things in mind.
The conclusion explains all questions:  it will never happen to me.
  It will.  Tough luck.
  I  was  fooled - yes, I admit that.  But now, I understand.  When you are
confronted  with  the final truth, when it crawls under your skin and shows
its ugly face - you will understand too.

        - Mother...
        - Yes, my son?
        - I...  must tell you something.
        - You sound strange?  Is something wrong?
        - Yes...  it really is...
        - Tell me!  Let me help you!  What has happened!  Tell me!
        - Mother...
        - Tell me!

  I love this black suit.  I look really sharp in it.  My black sun-glasses
are perfect.  The automatic pistol is even better.  I bought it a long time
ago to protect my life.
  Major domination!
  It  will  be  used  for  its real purpose, I promise.  It will be used to
explore the darkest closet of existence.  Meaning of life, will be clear to
me.  The gun is only a tool to help me go through with this.  My mission is
to  crush  the  corruption.   Not  all corruption, that is impossible.  But
maybe, just maybe, my small contribution can help.  Or maybe not.
  This is a sick world.  A really rotten, stinking world.  The world itself
is  not  very  bad.   But  the  attitudes  suck  bigtime.  Be something, do
something, live forever.
  Run with the pack or follow the leader.

        - I will...
        - Say it!
        - I...  I cannot.
        - Say it!  It will help you!  Confess the truth to yourself!
        - FUCK YOU!

  Yeah,  fuck  you!   I park the car a few blocks away from his house.  The
night has turned into morning.  Birds sing and the red sun slowly makes its
way into the sky.  I walk towards the entrance.
  Then I stop.  I hesitate!  I really do!
  So what if I do?  Would you like to make something out of it?  Why  do we
not live in paradise?  Who constructed this vision?  Is it all a dream that
we  will  wake  up  from with a scream, or with a smile?  Will someone bend
over my face and ask we if I enjoyed it?
  Questions, questions...
  Fuck  them.   My steps are convinced.  I knock hard on the door.  For the
first time in my life I am lucky.  He opens the door.  He asks me who I am.
Who  I  am!   Remember me, I say and laugh!  I am  that small kid who faced
the hard ground while you stood on my head!  Remember?
  He  says nothing.  That is fine with me.  I place the gun to his head and
pull the trigger.
  It is not like in the movies.

        - Say it!
        - FUCK YOU!
        - Say it!
        - I will die!  I will really die!
        - Good...

  I  have  a long journey in front of me.  People have to be visited.  They
will  have  to confront me again and remember me!  All of them.  They would
not  have  understood  the  meaning  of  life  anyway.   I  have.   I  have
understood.   I  am just a fart in the hard wind.  The only way to be seen,
is  to  catch  the day.  I takes a hard blow to your chin to get the facts.
Someone  or  Something  have  to  grab  you by your shoulders and shake you
violently until you realize that you-are-absolutely-nothing.
  Unless you try.  Let us catch the day!

        - Now say everything that feels hard for you to say.
        - Please...
        - Say it!  You have to!  You must fight your depression!
        - I have brain cancer.  I have less than six months to live.
        - Fine.  Use these months with care!

  I sure do!  I sure do...  Next stop will be my ex-wife.  Let us catch the
short day before it is too late!
  I am about to go all systems out.
