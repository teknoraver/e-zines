		Clear the way for the prophets of rage
		Engagin' on the stage, on a track
		Tell Jack stay in the back
		I was born
		Every level I'm on
		You're warned
		Just in case you forgot
		I pump in kilowatts
		To let 'em know which direction
		To go what's up I wanna know
		I test the front row
		Forgiven the givin' while the livin' is livin' it up
		So many people is sleepin' while standin' up
		Not dressed to impress or fess it
		That's it text to the brain like FedEx
		Treated one and the same
		'Cause the name of the game
		Don't give 'em checks above necks
		Some don't realize the same side
		Siddity in the city
		Suburbs or projects
		But we're livin' in a different time
		Some speed, some lead
		While some jus' pump rhymes
		Then again all in da same gang
		Info to flow
		And heal all below
		Let's go and find
		The piece of mind that's taken
		Or else the black
		or start breakin'
		Public Enemy no!

 REBIRTH -Ridenhour-Robertz-Gary G-Wiz-Depper-
 ______________________________________________________________________________

		When I get down
		I give what go around
		And when I cough
		I do my best to cut it off
		I don't claim to be a preacher
		Not paid to be a teacher
		But I'm grown
		I try to be a leader to the bone
		Never could follow a man
		Wit' a bottle
		He's a baby wit' a beard
		Not a feared role model
		And they ask me where I got it
		I get it from my pops
		Wit' a man in the house
		All the bullshit stops
		Then I sing a song
		About what the hell is goin' wrong
		You never know
		If you only trust the TV and the radio
		These days
		You can't see who's in cahoots
		'Cause now the KKK
		Wears three-piece suits
		It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
		In fact you know it's like that y'all

 NIGHTTRAIN -Ridenhour-Robertz-Gary G-Wiz-The JBL-Depper-
 ______________________________________________________________________________

		Land of the free
		But the skin I'm in identifies me
		So the people around me
		Energize me
		Callin' all aboard this train ride
		Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore
		Leavin' frauds on the outside
		But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
		And the reason
		For that is 'cause we look the same
		Lookin' all around at my so called friend
		Light skin to the brown
		The black
		Here we go again
		Homey over there knows Keith an
		But he be thiefin'
		I don't trust him
		Rather bust 'em
		Up out goes his hand and I cough
		He once stole from me
		Yeah I wanna cut it off
		The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
		It rides the good and the bad
		We call the monkey trained
		Trained to attack the black it's true
		'Cause some of them look just like you
		Stayin' on the scene
		Sittin' on the train
		See all the faces
		Look about the same
		There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
		'Cause he deal
		The keys from Key Largo
		Runnin' Nat narcotic
		By George he got it
		Takin' makin' the G erotic
		And the fiends they scheme
		So he can put 'em down
		But his method is wreck 'em
		Put 'em in tha ground
		Got tha nerve as hell
		To yell brother man
		He ain't black man
		Known to murder his own
		Traitor on the phone
		Ridin' the train
		Self-hater trained
		To sell pain
		The master's toy
		Little boy
		Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
		'Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
		'Cause his face looks just like yours
		More of the same insane who sayin'
		Like flowin' like nighttrain
		Runnin' the pain of the black reign
		You look, you laugh
		You doubt and go out
		And I'm gone
		But the bass goes on
		To talk the talk, but walk the walk
		The king of New York
		Crack a lack attack the black
		To crack the back
		Once again I test a friend wit' sincerity
		Or consider him an enemy
		Who am I to tell a lie
		Rather push da bush
		Hope da cracker get crushed
		I'm rollin' wit' rush
		Leader of the bum rush
		Russian I ain't
		Spreadin' like paint
		Lookin' at the put I got
		And its kickin'
		But it ain't chicken
		But it's livin' for a city
		So sick 'n' tired
		Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file
		Senile or chile
		They said it never been no worser
		Than this, I'm on the nighttrain
		They hope ya don't miss it
		Give ya what dey gotta give you just go
		You musn't just put your
		Trust in every brother yo
		Some don't give a damn
		'Cause they the other man
		Worse than a bomb
		Posin' as Uncle Toms
		Disgracin' the race
		Blowin' up
		The whole crew
		Wit' some of them lookin'
		Just like you

 CAN'T TRUSS IT  -Ridenhour-Robertz-Gary G-Wiz-Depper-
 ______________________________________________________________________________

		Bass in your face
		Not an eight track
		Gettin' it good to the wood
		So the people
		Give you some a dat
		Reactin' to the fax
		That I kick and it stick
		And it stay around
		Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
		Goin', goin', gettin' to the roots
		Ain't givin' it up
		So turn me loose
		But then again I got a story
		That's harder than the hardcore
		Cost of the holocaust
		I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on
		I know
		Where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
		From the base motherland
		The place of the drum
		Invaded by the wack diddie wack
		Fooled the black, left us faded
		King and chief probably had a big beef
		Because of dat now I grit my teeth
		So here's a song to the strong
		'Bout a shake of a snake
		And the smile went along wit dat
		Can't truss it
		Kickin' wicked rhymes
		Like a fortune teller
		'Cause the wickedness done by Jack
		Where everybody at
		Divided and sold
		For liquor and the gold
		Smacked in the back
		For the other man to mack
		Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory
		Little Rock where they be
		Dockin' this boat
		No hope I'm shackled
		Plus gang tackled
		By the other hand swingin' the rope
		Wearin' red, white and blue Jack and his crew
		The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
		Man to the man, each one so it teach one
		Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
		One love who said it
		I know Whodini sang it
		But the hater taught hate
		That's why we gang bang it
		Beware of the hand
		When it's comin' from the left
		I ain't trippin' just watch ya step
		Can't truss it
		An I judge everyone, one by the one
		Look here come the judge
		Watch it here he come now
		I can only guess what's happ'nin'
		Years ago he woulda been
		The ships captain
		Gettin' me bruised on a cruise
		What I got to lose, lost all contact
		Got me layin' on my back
		Rollin' in my own leftover
		When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else's
		90 F--kin' days on a slave ship
		Count 'em fallin' off 2, 3, 4 hun'ed at a time
		Blood in the wood and it's mine
		I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain
		Like my brain bein' chained
		Still gotta give it what I got
		But it's hot in the day, cold in the night
		But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
		Attitude boils up inside
		And that ain't it (think I'll every quit)
		Still I pray to get my hands 'round
		The neck of the man wit' the whip
		3 months pass, they brand a label on my ass
		To signify
		Owned
		I'm on the microphone
		Sayin' 1555
		How I'm livin'
		We been livin' here
		Livin' ain't the word
		I been givin'
		Haven't got
		Classify us in the have-nots
		Fightin' haves
		'Cause it's all about money
		When it comes to Armageddon
		Mean I'm getting mine
		Here I am turn it over Sam
		427 to the year
		Do you understand
		That's why it's hard
		For the black to love the land
		Once again
		Bass in your face
		Not an eight track
		Gettin' it good to the wood
		So the people
		Give you some a dat
		Reactin' to the fax
		That I kick and it stick
		And it stay around
		Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
		Goin', goin', gettin' to the roots
		Ain't givin' it up
		So turn me loose

		Yo! ho!   yo niga! yo niga! no niga!
		Check it out
		How can you say to me yo my niga
		Cursin' up a storm with your finger on a trigger
		Feelin' all the girls like a big gold digger

		Goddamn kilogram, how do you figure
		I don't want to be called yo niga

		My boss told me yo niga you're fired
		Yo niga this, yo niga that
		I know you're a niga now 'cause your head got fat
		Flava framalama boy you won't figure

		Everybody playin' it rolling on the scales
		'Cause everybody's weighin' it
		Toby say yo I be good niga
		Let me get a shovel make a good digger
		I don't care how small or bigger
		I don't want to be called yo niga

 HOW TO KILL A RADIO CONSULTANT  -Ridenhour-Robertz-Gary G-Wiz-Depper-
 ______________________________________________________________________________

		Pusher of the button
		Talkin' loud ain't sayin' nuttin'
		The mack of the format gettin' fat
		Ain't funny 'cause my neighborhood
		Is flowin' money
		Thank God 4 the boulevard
		They keep the motor runnin'
		The rap shows coincide wit' the tape flow
		Bootleggers go inside and record the record low
		They get me, get this now can you freestyle
		Freestyle no styles free except da radio
		But the radio controlled by the sucker move
		Who moved away got away after plannin' a getaway
		An now he wanna play what he wanna play
		An got say on what is bumpin' of course he's gettin' somethin'
		Never know what's good to tha neighborhood
		Swear I never seen da sucker
		In my necka da woods
		The ass is connected to the brain stem
		So I sing a simple song
		So you can see the sucker in 'em
		People got to make a call
		To hear the yes y'all (yes y'all)
		While the phone keep ringin'
		You hear some singer singin'
		Why don't dey play the jammy in the daytime
		People think it's slammin' plus the rhyme
		Is hot an got me tunin'
		The afternoon is FM in the PM
		Oh if that they could see 'im
		Out-of-towner not down I think they'll dis him
		Up goes the season, pop goes the weasel
		Damn gimme rap no band I want some x-clan
		I know dey even got it from the giddy
		Stacked in the back
		Only black radio station in the city
		Programmed by a sucker in a suit
		Slick back hair he don't even live here
		Raps the number one pick so I draft it
		I don't care about all the other demographics
		When the quiet storm come on I fall sleep
		What dey need is Arbitron on the funky jeep
		Too bad it's goin' on in fact my word is bond
		To pull a disappearin' act attack until he gone
		The whacker jam he play they pay I'm in da day
		I don't think we gonna miss 'im we don't need 'im anyway
		Can I kick it
		Who the hell is on the radio
		Or who's behind
		Do you really think they'll mind
		To play the funky jams
		That everybody wit'
		Some Def Jef or Ice T
		Show they rollin' wit' the syndicate
		Or can dey get funky
		Wit' the underground
		Master ace get a taste
		Bomb squad gettin' hard
		Marley mart makin' hipper
		Trax for Jack The Ripper
		Pumpin' Eric B or Papa San
		Still rollin' wit' run
		Did you think that ever
		In fact you thought that never
		Control of your soul
		Is by a suit and tie
		Then U wonder why why U never hear a rhyme
		I say we do 'im
		Till it's done

 ______________________________________________________________________________

		I'm countin' down to the day deservin'
		Fittin' for a king
		I'm waitin' for the time when I can
		Get to Arizona
		'Cause my money's spent on
		The goddamn rent
		Neither party is mine not the
		Jackass or the elephant
		20.000 nig niggy nigas in the corner
		Of the cell block but they come
		From California
		Population none in the desert and sun
		Wit' a gun cracker
		Runnin' things under his thumb
		Starin' hard at the postcards
		Isn't it odd and unique?
		Seein' people smile wild in the heat
		120 degree
		'Cause I wanna be free
		What's a smilin' fact
		When the whole state's racist
		Why want a holiday F--k it 'cause I wanna
		So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner
		I ain't drinkin' no 40
		I B thinkin' time wit' a nine
		Until we get some land
		Call me the trigger man
		Looki lookin' for the governor
		Huh he ain't lovin' ya
		But here to trouble ya
		He's rubbin' ya wrong
		Get the point come along
		An he can get to the joint
		I urinated on the state
		While I was kickin' this song
		Yeah, he appear to be fair
		The cracker over there
		He try to keep it yesteryear
		The good ol' days
		The same ol' ways
		That kept us dyin'
		Yes, you me myself and I'ndeed
		What he need is a nosebleed
		Read between the lines
		Then you see the lie
		Politically planned
		But understand that's all she wrote
		When we see the real side
		That hide behind the vote
		They can't understand why he the man
		I'm singin' 'bout a king
		They don't like it
		When I decide to mike it
		Wait I'm waitin' for the date
		For the man who demands respect
		'Cause he was great c'mon
		I'm on the one mission
		To get a politician
		To honor or he's a gonner
		By the time I get to Arizona
		I got 25 days to do it
		If a wall in the sky
		Just watch me go thru it
		'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do
		PE number one
		Gets the job done
		When it's done and over
		Was because I drove'er
		Thru all the static
		Not stick but automatic
		That's the way it is
		He gotta get his
		Talin' MLK
		Gonna find a way
		Make the state pay
		Lookin' for the day
		Hard as it seems
		This ain't no damn dream
		Gotta know what I mean
		It's team against team
		Catch the light beam
		So I pray
		I pray everyday
		I do and praise jah the maker
		Lookin' for culture
		I got but not here
		From jah maker
		Pushin' and shakin' the structure
		Bringin' down the babylon
		Hearin' the sucker
		That make it hard for the brown
		The hard Boulova
		I need now
		More than ever now
		Who's sittin' on my freedah'
		Opressor people beater
		Piece of the pick
		We picked a piece
		Of land that we deservin' now
		Reparation a piece of the nation
		And damn he got the nerve
		Another niga they say and classify
		We want too much
		My peep plus the whole nine is mine
		Don't think I even double dutch
		Here's a brother my attitude hit 'em
		Hang 'em high
		Blowin' up the 90s started tickin' 86
		When the blind get a mind
		Better start and earn while we sing it
		Now
		There will be the day we know those down and who will go

		Stop pullin' those lil' stunts
		Assault and battery
		'Cause I snatched the battery
		Off his back...the TV pack
		Why pop the rhyme
		On a rhymer when I kick it
		Rather spend my time, spittin' on a bigot
		Who pumped the pimp
		That fed the fiends
		He got jumped by the brothers in Ft. Green
		They slapped the mack
		That kept us back
		Sucker suckin' the hood like drack

		Who got the money betcha bottom
		Dollar bill
		Gonna find
		Some rich ol' bloodline

		One million bottlebags count 'em
		Think they can bounce the ounce
		And it get 'em
		Yo black spend 288 million
		Sittin' there waitin' for the fizz
		And don't know what the fuck it is
		An oh lemme tell you 'bout shorty
		He about seventeen lookin' like 40
		Treats his 40 dog better than his g
		When he gets a big b-o-t-t-l-e
		Oh he loves tha liquor
		But look watch shorty get sicker
		Year after year
		While he's thinkin' it's beer
		But it's not but he got it in his gut
		So what the fuck
		Yo niga what's up
		Now he's hostile to a brother lookin' out
		But I ain't mad I know what he about
		He's just a slave to the bottle and the can
		'Cause that's his man
		The malt liquor man
		One million bags count 'em all
		Other man gets happy
		Watch the killas drink 8 ball
		Don't know a damn thing
		But his breath stinkin'
		Then I ask a question you brother
		What the fuck is you drinkin'
		He don't know but it flow
		Out the bottle in a cup
		He call it gettin' fucked up
		Like we ain't fucked up already
		See the man they call Crazy Eddie
		Liquor man with the bottle in his hand
		He give the liquor man ten to begin
		Wit' no change and he run
		To get his brains rearranged
		Serve it to the home they're able
		To do without a table
		Beside what's inside ain't on the label
		They drink it thinkin' it's good
		But they don't sell the shit in the white neighborhood
		Exposin' the plan they get mad at me I understand
		They're slaves to the liquor man
		Back to my homeboy shorty
		He can drink it down
		And think nuttin' about it
		Pass it around and get tha 40 dog buzz
		At the same time
		Shorty can't remember what day it was
		Say I'm yellin' is fact
		Genocide kickin' in yo back
		How many times have you seen
		A black fight a black
		After drinkin' down a bottle
		Or a malt liquor six-pack
		Malt liquor bull
		What it is is bullshit Colt
		45 another gun to the brain
		Who's sellin' us pain
		In the hood another up to no good
		Plan that's designed by the other man
		But who drink it like water
		One and on till the stores reorder it
		Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it
		Sippin' it lick drink it down oh nooo
		Drinkin' poison but they don't know
		It used to be wine
		A dollar and a dime
		Same man, drink in another time
		They could be hard as hell and don't give a damn
		But still be a sucker to the liquor man

 BRING THA NOIZE (WITH ANTHRAX)  -Ridenhour-Shocklee-Sadler-Anthrax-
 ______________________________________________________________________________

		Bass! How low can you go?
		Death row what a brother knows
		Once again, back is the incredible
		The rhyme animal
		The incredible D. Public Enemy number one
		Five-O said "Freeze!" and I got numb
		Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
		But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
		Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
		'Cause a brother like me said "Well
		Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
		What he can say to you, what you ought to do"
		Follow for now, power to the people say,
		"Make a miracle. D, pump the lyrical"
		Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
		Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

		Chorus
		Turn it up! Bring tha noize!

		Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
		At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
		Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
		'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
		Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music
		that the critics are blasting me for
		They'll never care for the brothers and sisters
		now across the country has us up for the war

		We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
		Till we get it right
		Radio Stations I question their blackness
		They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

		Chorus

		Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
		My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
		He can cut a record from side to side
		So what, the ride, the glide
                should be much safer than a suicide
		Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
		Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
		Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
		You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
		Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
		Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
		Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
		Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
		Beat is for Eric B, and L.L. as well, hell
		Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
		Ever forever, universal, it will sell
		Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

		Chorus

		From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
		'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
		Rock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?
		Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
		We got to pleed the fifth, we can investigate
		Don't need to wait, get the record straight
		Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
		X to sign checks, play to get paid
		We got to check it out down on the avenue
		A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
		Yeah, I'm telling you
