                               INTRODUCTION
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is meant to be Your guide in How To Cause Panic. What kind of panic? Well,
you'll find out if you continue reading... But to give you a little idea of
what it's all about I'll explain the magic word Panic to you all.

Panic, my friends, is what happens to people when something not expected
happens, which they can't comprehend, if they think their life is at stake
or just if they get confused. Then they start doing what everybody else is
doing, in most cases that is: running like mad in some random direction.

Now you might say, as the experienced anarchist you are, "That's no problem!"
"Easiest thing on earth, kid!"... well, as most other textfiles, the reason
this file is released is that it's supposed to give you NEW fresh ideas
in how to cause massive and devastating panic when You feel like it.

So, where is the best and most effective place to start panic? Well, there
are numerous of places actually. Some rules you should follow when you choose
location to start your actions at should look something like this though.

 Choose

    * An "everyday" place (restaurants, schools)
    * Places with a lot of people in a small area (cinemas)
    * Places where people can't run away (trains, busses, traffic jams, planes)
    * Places where it's Least likely that something (violent) would happen
      (police headquarters, the fire department)
    * Places where it's Most likely that something will happen (factories;
       not necessary "dangerous" factories)

     Or as a Main Rule

    * Any place where there's a lot of people. The people can either be
      running from one spot to another (eg. subways) and thus not paying
      attention to what's happening around them.
      Occasions when people gather together for one special reason (concerts,
      sport games, cinemas) and their minds are as far from anarchistic
      actions as possible. Everything to gain the good-ol' surprising
      (read: panic) part of it.
      A feature of a good Panic location is a place where people can't run far
      neither fast away from the scene of the crime (boats, hospitals).

Now you might think; If you are at a football arena, people DO expect strange
things to happen, and are always peeping in the Emergency Exit direction...
Wrong... dead wrong... they aren't. Of some strange reason they never do,
and probably never will. Well, if they appreciate the game more than their own
lives, that's fine with me. They wont have time to regret it anyway.



                                  METHODS
                                  ~~~~~~~
To pick out the best methods of causing crowds of people to panic, you must
think of what people in common are afraid of. I will try to list some very
anar-popular methods to cause panic.



 *) Fire/Smoke;
    Yeah, this is the classic method of causing panic. Everybody is afraid of
    getting burned to death, and why blame them? It's not a very nice way
    to die (except for the spectator).

    The thing that first kicks off the Real Panic isn't the fire itself, it's
    smoke! So, to have in mind when you're planning to evacuate your local
    cinema, is to make the fire smoke as much as possible. So the size of
    the fire isn't that important (well, in most cases), it's how much smoke
    that's produced (eg. car tires'n'gasoline etc).

    The theatrical value of this death can't any movie director offer, or even
    come close to in their productions. Be sure to have all your anar-friends
    gathered to watch every time you've set fire to a cinema or similar.



 *) Water/Drowning;
    Well, this takes some planning and preparations before it's carried out...
    Causing panic on a big boat isn't that easy (if you don't want to play
    with fire/smoke again). So, how to make the people believe that the whole
    damn boat is sinking Titanic-style? Well, it's NOT a piece of cake (if
    you're planning to survive yourself that is). What you'll have to do is
    to put an extra cable to the boat's fog-horn (be sure that it still works
    as normal) and connect it to a car-battery/similar. Then some big
    explosives (loud-sounding things, non-damaging).

    Now, if you haven't figured it out already, detonate your explosives (some
    on-board and some at the car-deck for example) and some seconds after that,
    disconnect the "normal" fog-horn wire and start sending about 1-second
    signals, - - - -, repeatedly. The signal doesn't mean anything, but the
    people will, after hearing loud explosions and screaming people, translate
    ANY loud sound to mean "Danger". And if you have your crowd (10-15 people,
    preferably some of them female, their screaming is more terrifying) running
    around and pushing people "trying to get to the life boats"-style...

    If you've done this right, people will run around like mad, and jump into
    the water to save their lives (they think).
    Ok, now there may be some cool passengers on this boat-trip that may be
    some sceptic to this panicking activities, and will just try to find out
    what really has happened and if it's really That dangerous to stay aboard.
    To make people like that also jump into the ocean, throw in some smoke
    bombs on the lower decks... The result never fails; Panic.



 *) (Big) Accidents;
    Now this could be considered a practical joke really (tell the judge).
    This is funny man... Order tickets from your local train office and get
    data for your trip, such as; what's the train number, which stations
    does it pass, when will it leave "your" station and when it will arrive
    at your destination city. With all this in mind (or preferably on a piece
    of paper), prepare a tape with a "pop-in" recording which states that
    something really BAD has just happened along the railway that you've
    ordered tickets for. That message could sound something like:

      <alert sound/music> "We have a very important announcement to the
      citizens of TO_TOWN. A terrorist has hijacked train XYZ coming from
      FROM_TOWN. He has not given any demands. From the train radio he
      said he had killed the train driver and that he would sacrifice the
      passengers of the train in the name of Allah by driving in high speed
      through some railway switches in TO_TOWN. The police department have no
      idea of what to do to stop this. The government has mobilized the army
      and they are now preparing, together with the police and the fire
      department, to take care of the to-be victims in this on-coming
      catastrophy and waste of human lives. That's all for this news
      broadcast. Now back to the music."

    Remember to sound Serious and Extremely similar to the traffic-accident
    broadcasts they have where You live.

    Now then, you're finished, time for the action... When it's time for
    the train to come, get on it and bring that big ghettoblaster of yours
    with you. Now, after the people have sat down, and the train has been
    going for quite a while, you put your prepared tape in the GB and just
    turn on your radio (the Real radio broadcasts). After some few minutes,
    press the "Play" button on it and switch from "Radio" to "Tape", sit back
    and listen. And your little message runs...
    After the last line in your message, be sure to switch back to "Radio"
    again (so the other people with radio (maybe waiting for the next news
    broadcast) will hear it IS the radio who's playing from your GB!!!)

    You should now start "panicking" yourself, screaming "we're all going to
    be killed!! aaaaaaAAA!", "oh god! you heard that!! aaaaaaaaaAAAA! we
    haven't got a chance!", "Why haven't anybody pulled the emergency breaks?
    <scream> <yell>" and similar... if you can bring a few girls you know,
    it will help you. Women's scream a lot louder and is more frightening to
    listen to, especially when you're going to die. If the people in your
    wagon haven't start running around screaming, and grabbing the emergency
    breaks... you've failed... Next time; be sure to have your ghettoblaster
    turned up a bit louder so that Everyone hears the "broadcast". 



                              Your EQUIPMENT
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a checklist for your anar-"tricks" when you're out to make some people
run their legs off... Be sure to always bring:

 * Smoke bombs (small and big ones)

 * Gasoline (some bottles and rags too, your choice)

 * Igniters (Lighters, Matches)

 * List of places to "visit"

 * People you trust, no chicken shit mutha (that is, if he's not supposed
     to bring a bang-bang-bag into some restaurant, while you and the rest
     go to a safer place... hehehe)


Special items for special occasions:

 * Rubber (boots, tires for smoke fx)

 * Big written signs (such as "Anarkoy was here", leave no fingerprints)

 * Camcorder (save for your next meeting, do NOT copy it to sell it...
     the cops love it too much)



                                BE AWARE OF
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't visit the same place twice... But if you REALLY want to hit the same
location more than once, think of this:

1) They may be more prepared. You be that you too.

2) Do NOT perform your "hit" exactly the same way as you did last time.

3) Whatever you used the last time, use much more this time.



                               THE LAST WORD
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ok, voice of the editor of this file now. This is my first file for uXu, but
I will (don't worry) be writing more files for them. On subjects as
anarchy/terror, hacking, phreaking... and, he he he, some special subjects
for you crazy ass readers out there.
Don't know the date for the next file, I only have 48 hours/week to write this
you know (weekends, of course...). Well, the military made up the rules, not
me (and I find it, at present time, slightly hard to change these rules :) ).

Mail me tricks, tips, death threats etc on
