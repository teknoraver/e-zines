  Hello and welcome to our little discussion group.  Today, we will discuss
the  subject  BLEED.   BLEED  is  a  game  that  was written by The GNN and
produced  by Dual Crew.  At first, we will look at these messages, that our
friend Ralph found on UseNet.
  Look at this folks!

   Also, it's not much of a game.  Reminds me of one of those "adventure"
   books that you have a couple of choices to proceed to and only one is
   the "correct" one.  Yawn!  Can't these guys think of anything better
   to do than hook up a modplayer to the lamest text adventure to *ever*
   come down the pipe.
   (And yes, it it racist.)

  Deep  arguments!  Hard facts!  Ah, now I notice that Brad Nixon NYPD, the
hero  in  the  game,  would  like  to  comment  these  messages.  Brad, the
microphone is yours!  Shoot.  NO, WAIT.  Put down the gun!  Thank you.
  Tell us what you have to say.

  FUCK YOU ALL!
  (acoustic feedback) (can someone lower the volume?)
  I  am a great American Man and I respect the FREEDOM OF SPEECH!  I am not
someone  who  cannot  see  the mirror that reflects the sick society we are
living  in!   I  do  not  try  to "buy" myself tickets to heaven by telling
people that I dislike things I do not understand!
  BLEED  is  a cruel game that kicks everybody in the ass:  nazis, niggers,
gays, jews, feminists, macho men, children, the police force and especially
United States of America!
  Brad  Nixon  understand  if some people get offended - he loves it!  Only
those who have some individual thinking left can see through the mirror and
discover the truth!
  The  one  who  controls the information have got the power to control the
society.   If  the  information  cannot be controlled by the law, there are
other  ways...  Individuals who are intellectually weak are easy to exploit
for these purposes.
  Let them think that they are doing the "right thing"!
  Let them destroy themselves!
  If  we  cannot  forbid  people to say whatever they want to say, let them
believe  that  they  are  not  allowed to speak because of magic words like
"moral".
  Let them believe that they ARE NOT CAPABLE OF THINKING FOR THEMSELVES!
  FUCK YOU!
  If you do not allow another individual to read, watch or listen, then YOU
are  a  part of the sick society!  You place yourself on a throne where you
decide  what  is  good  and  evil, right and wrong!  You look down on other
people  -  you see them as a crowd that runs in the direction that is shown
to  them.   You  ACTUALLY  believe that YOU are doing the right thing.  But
what you are really doing is something else.
  You think that YOU are better than everybody else!
  FUCK YOU!

  (i think we dare to raise that volume now)
  Thank  you  Brad.  (Please sit down and put your .44 back in the holster.
Remember  that  there are women present).  Now we will give the word to the
producers, Dual Crew.
  Dual Crew, please tell us what you have to say.

                Many people have a wish of being "someone".
                When BLEED I and BLEED II had been released
                  some of these poor individuals claimed
                 that these games were racial and cruel
                      and that they should be banned.

                  This is true. The BLEED games are cruel
                 and racial. But they are only a mirror
                     of the world we are living in.
                    BLEED should be seen as irony over
                   the sick society we are experiencing.

                    So, instead of bitch and shout over
                   subjects you do not understand, take
                     a further step and discover your
                              own situation.

                  We thought that most people were bright
                      enough to understand this - but
                    I guess we were wrong... people are
                       really stupid on this planet.

  Gee,  we  all  feel  a  bit guilty now do we?  (Laughter).  But now, I am
really  curios  to hear what The GNN has to say.  Gnn, how do you feel when
you  people  dislike  your  game?   Anger?  Hate?  Love?  Sex and violence?
Exploited?
  Tell us.

     I have no comments.

  I see.  (shit) Thank you anyway.  That was all for today!  Please join us
next  week when we will penetrate the HOT subject "If we really need to have
sex more than twice a year!"
