                     "ALS SPRACH THE GNN - TEN TOPICS"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrewShining/uXu


        "Thoughts and words. - Not even your thoughts are possible
                   to be completely expressed in words"
                  (Friedrich Nietzsche, "Die froliche Wissenschaft")



  About Philosophy. 

  I  am a philosopher - which means that I think.  I think about everything
and  hope to one day find the truth to everything.  Really?  Yep, one day I
will  find  the  truth.  Will you?  Some people analyze  their religion and
try to  find the truth.  Others penetrate  the universe to  find the truth.
Let  me  tell  you  what  I think.  When your life is about to end the only
answer  you will find is that the truth to everything is to think about the
truth  to  everything  and realize that the truth to everything is to think
about the truth to everything.


  About Guilt.

  If  you  lose  your job and money, and end  up in the street as a beggar,
that is your own fault according to the society.  You have not been smart -
there  is  a  solution  to all problems.  You did not care to find them and
exploit these solutions.  If you crash into a tree with your car, the fault
is first of all yours.  You should have been more careful.  So, all of this
means  that the guilt is not in the gun itself (it is a dead object made of
steel).   The one who fires the gun cannot be held responsible either.  You
are  the  guilty one!  It is you who are hit by the bullet - if you had not
been  there  nothing would have happened.  The bullet does not kill you, it
is your body that causes you pain and in the end turns your brain OFF.


  About Love and Marriage.

  What  is love?  To me, it seems like everybody have an urge to lose their
virginity.   When they have done so, they want more.  But suddenly they are
trapped  in  marriage.   Stuck  forever,  or for a while with the excuse "I
love...".   There  is  no freedom in this - only pain!  The  minds collapse
and  begin to  recover with more excuses.  "Maybe I can stand this...  what
is  the  meaning  of  being  free  anyway...   I  can  free myself on other
locations..."  How hard you try, when you are trapped in marriage, you have
lost the basic freedom.  Without that, you are a prisoner.


  About Intellectuals.

  Those  who indirectly claim  to be smarter than the others are all of the
same type.  They want to be different; dislike everything that others like,
argue  for  changes  even  if  it  works  out  fine,  shout for revolution.
Religion  is an opium for the common people but revolution is the opium for
the  intellectual.   A  pig wants to rule every other pig around him in the
mud,  an  industrial  worker  wants  to  be  a  boss  of the factory and an
intellectual  wants  to  rule everything from others thoughts to the world.
It is simply a matter of how high you build your pedestal.


  About Tastes.

  What  I like is right and what you like is often wrong.  I know that what
I like is right (hey, how can I be wrong about something that FEELS good?).
That  is  why my taste is always better than yours.  I know what I know and
what I know must be right since I know what I know.  You do not know what I
know  and  since I know that I am right, you must be wrong!  That is why we
can  keep going on fighting about what is bad taste and what is good taste.
Oh, is not that wonderful?


  About Jerks.

  What  is  a  jerk?  Let me tell you, that is a person who is not what you
are.  That is why he calls you a jerk too.


  About the Highest Castle.

  The  one  who  builds the highest castle is seen as an individual who has
become  successful.   The  one who in his mind manages to imagine himself a
high  castle  can  also "become something in life".  The difference is that
the  last  one  has  to  prove to the others that he has actually built the
highest  castle  in  his  mind.   If he cannot do that, nobody believes nor
understands him.


  About Moral.

  If  you  help  an  old lady over the street, are you doing something good
then?   What  if  the lady were on her way to rob a bank on the other side?
If  you steal a car, are you doing something wrong then?  What if the owner
later  that  day  had  crashed if you had not done that?  What is right and
what  is wrong is impossible to answer.  What is morally correct is easier.
Those  actions  that are done with an urge to do good are correct.  Even if
the result becomes the opposite, the action is morally correct.


  About Freedom.

  A  trapped  bird  feels free if it has been trapped all its life.  If the
bird  suddenly  is  set free it realizes "Hey, THIS is freedom!  How come I
have  not  understood  that  earlier?".   How  come?   Once you expand your
freedom  you  cannot  go back to a trapped state and feel free again.  When
will  the  human  race  free  itself  from  its  chains and understand real
freedom?  When will the human race understand that it is trapped in a small
cage  with  a  possible  way  out?   When  will the human race DARE to step
through that possible way out?


  About Paranoia.

  I  claim that one of the most egoistical feelings is paranoia.  A man who
is  paranoid  claims  that  everybody  wants  to  get  him.  Ha!  Why would
everybody want to get him?  Since he has done Something.  That Something is
Something  Really  Big, Something Really Great.  It is of course a criminal
act,  but  it  is  an  ADVANCED criminal act.  Hackers are masters of this.
They  are  constantly  chased  by  Someone.   Why?   Since  they  have done
Something  Incredible.  The whole world want to get them since they are the
shockwave riders of the secret matrix world.  They are in the center of the
worlds attention all the time.  Hence:  egoistical.
