                           HOW TO SHRINK A HEAD
                            By THE GNN/DC/uXu


Hello and welcome to another "how to..." file! This time I will teach you
the basic knowledge on shrinking heads. Don't say "How barbaric!" now, 
because you will soon realize that having a collection of heads is the
cult-phenomena of the 90's!

     
      1. At first you need a human head. This is the hard part.
         Remember to be careful when you cut it off from the body.

      2. Then you have to remove the cranium. The is easily done by
         cutting from the forehead, over the head and down to the
         back of the head. Remove everything inside the head.
      
      3. Now boil the skin from the head in ordinary water for about
         half an hour. The head should now be about 1/3 of its original
         size.
 
      4. Scrap off the last pieces of flesh on the inside of the head
         and sew the mouth, eyes and back of the head shut.

      5. Now take 5-6 small rocks and put them into a fire until they
         get red hot. Roll them inside the head - one at a time - and
         model the head until it get the original look.
         If the head is to small for rocks, use sand instead.
         
      6. Now work with the head for a couple of hours every day in a
         week and viola - you got yourself a real human head!
         It's the perfect ice-breaker at parties. "Wanna come home
         and look at my shrunk heads?"


Well, these heads are also told to give you eternal life somehow but
I doubt it. Maybe it will give you a couple of years in a asylum if
you boast too much about them. If you are having trouble finding heads,
just use your imagination! A friend of mine used to shrink the heads of
his ex-girlfriends.
