THE BLINDFOLD

@SONG: Ten Little Girls

You think of no-one but yourself
You see the rest of us as fools
You think of no-one but yourself
You see the rest of us as fools

He said, don't feel guilty
Don't go crazy, don't get paranoid
With me

You play the prophet like a man
It makes no sense in the overall master plan

She said, don't feel guilty
Don't go crazy, don't get paranoid
With me

[--rap--]

You can't push, you're no good now
You can't push, you're no good now
Don't go crazy

Don't feel, feel, feel
Don't get, get, get

[--rap--]

You can't push, you're no good now
You can't push, you're no good now

Ten little girls come out to play
They didn't stand a chance, and got blown away
Say it isn't so
Ten little boys come out to play
They didn't stand a chance, and got blown away
Say it isn't so

Nine little girls got blown away
No, no, no, no
They didn't even have their own place to stay
Say it isn't so
Nine little boys got blown away
No, no, no, no
They didn't even have their own place to stay
Say it isn't so

[--rap--]



@SONG: I Speak Your Every Word

I spoke to you, just the other day
I hear your voice, from far away
I can smell deception, in your every word
Maybe I'm dreaming, and my vision is blurred

Something inside you
I see pictures of children
I speak your every word

You, are my saviour
You've come to fix me good, good, good
There's something about you
That makes me feel angry, and misunderstood

There's something inside you
There's something about you
I speak your every word



@SONG: Blindfold

You better believe it, hey yeah
You better believe it, hey yeah
You better believe it, hey yeah
You better believe it, hey yeah

[--talk--]

The stronger the man
The stronger the woman
If it ended now
Would you be willing
I've given you everything
I've given you nothing

[--talk--]

See how it feels for me
Do you believe in me?

[--talk--]

The stronger the man
The stronger the woman
If it ended now
Would you be willing
Do you believe in me?
See how it feels for me



@SONG: No Escape From Heaven

I can see through your eyes, the back of your minds
All that's said is fiction, the blind leading the blinds
I like to take your clothes off, and play for a while
Now hold my hand in summertime, walk for miles and you'll be a man
Hold my hand in summertime, and you are mine

It's no escape from heaven, try is in my eyes
It's no escape from heaven

I lie on the floor, don't open your eyes
Just listen to the sweetness of a slumber dive
Wake my heart of anger, let me in love
Push me into danger, give me a shove
Hold my hand in summertime, walk for miles and you'll be a man
Hold my hand in summertime, and you are mine

It's no escape from heaven, try is in my eyes
It's no escape from heaven

It's no escape from heaven, try is in my eyes
It's no escape from heaven

Hold my hand in summertime
Ohh just hold my hand in summertime

Hold me, hold me, hold me like you used to
Just hold me, hold me, hold me like you used to
Hold me, like you used to
Hold me, like you used to



THE FROZEN

@SONG: Coast Is Clear

Above my bed, in this only room
Hangs the whisper of the same men
You can't be my father, for the love we've shown
It's just a little to me, it's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be

Take it, I don't want it, you can have what you like
Just don't try and trick me to sleep, don't turn out those lights
You can't be my father, for the love we've shown
It's just a little to me, it's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, and always will be

Dreams of meeting you, my real father
Dreams of meeting truth, for the first [...]
I say, you can't be my father, for the love we've shown
It's just a little to me, it's never enough to swallow those pills
Now I'm sick, now I'm sick, now I'm sick

Just when you thought it was all right, I [...]
Just when you thought it was all right, I [...]

Coast is clear [repeat 8]



@SONG: The Colour Hurts

In mongst the beginning
The final curtain descends
The doorway to dating
Has revealed, it smells tense

The colour hurts, in this last birth of sins
Why do you grow inside me
It smells of glue as if spirals to victory says
Why do you grow inside me
Leave me alone

I was doing okay before
But now you're here, hold my hand
Now you've won, I understand

The colour hurts, in this last breath of sins
Why do you grow inside me
It smells of dew as if spirals to victory says
Why do you grow inside me
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

It's a [...] world for the complex is an eternity

The colour hurts, in this last birth of sins
Why do you grow inside me
It smells of dew as if spirals to victory says
Why do you grow inside me

Sell me some rebirth [repeat 4]
It's a destiny of sorts [repeat 4]
It's [...] [repeat 4]



@SONG: Frozen

In my eyes you smile like an angel
Blessed with love, in this deep mine

In my mind you sound like a creature
Blessed with soon, in this deep mine

In my heart, and in my soul
And everywhere I go
You are with me
I can feel you everywhere
Certain something in the air
You are with me
You are with me

Anyway, you cry like a baby
Blessed with [...], in this deep mine
You were born, and I were born
Waiting true for long to know
I will be, in this deep mine

In my heart, and in my soul
And everywhere I go
You are with me
I can feel you everywhere
Certain something in the air
You are with me
 
In my heart, and in my soul
And everywhere I go
You are with me

I can feel you everywhere
Certain something in the air
You are with me

You know, that man next door
Is getting on my nerves
Cos he's so rich in his low down politics
And you know his wife
She's such a pretty thing




@SONG: Zoo
 
She's had a psychotic dream
For the last ten days
She feels as if she's sinking
In and out, in and out, in and out of [...]
She combs up her hair
She think she's a queen
Starts telling all the choir boys she's this
She dresses in black only for the occasion
She thinks she's a negro, but she's only caucasian

She can't tune in
She can't tune in
She can't get off that bus
Can't get off that bus
She can't grab hold
She can't grab hold
She's a mess this girl
And [...]

Instead of watching my own dream
This is not what it seems, so calculated
Now that it's completed
I'm cautious with daylight, I'm frightened by sunlight
But I know those nights has to keep me from harm

She can't tune in
She can't tune in
She can't get off that bus
Can't get off that bus
Can't grab hold
She can't grab hold
She's a mess this girl
Please try

Keep on keeping me from harm [repeat 8]




THE CHERRY

@SONG: Clipped

Only in days, they get together
They're talking volumes, and drink some coffee
Clipped [...], clear and bright
They pour out [...], their own true mankind

There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too

All he says causes scandal
I've heard it said that he's the original of the vandal

He steals your words
Clears our mind

There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way, like accepting
There's no way, that's damned sure
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure

Hopelessly untrue
Yeah yeah

There's no truth
There's no lies
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure

There's no way, you can move me
There's no way, for sure
There's no truth
There's no lies



@SONG: Die Like a Dog

Could be, eating full
I will take the floor
Could be, winner full
I will play ball

Hiding inner hope
I am secret oath
I get black and cold
I won't play more

Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven

I'd like to see, to say that I'd survive
I'd like to see, to say that I'd survive

Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone get heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven

Just try not to die like a dog
End up alone, freezing from the smog
I'm just trying not to die in vain
Then leave my mark, stake my claim

Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world free from religion
Peace in a world where everyone gets heaven
Peace in a world, Peace in a world, Peace in a world
Free from religion

Listen to my eyes clean
Colorful confession
I remember mutual agression
The sign of the body sleeps



@SONG: Galaxy

He's got sugar on his lips
And he knows it [...] is his
And he shows it
He just shows it

Do you remember, do you vow the chemical
Show you the picture without the same degree

All he wants is
Blow by blow by blow counts
All searching for the new thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere

My place is [...] still invaded by sharks
Covered in glitter, shiny as glass

Leave him with something sweet
Galaxy sweet

He won't say no, he won't say yes
He won't say no, he won't say yeah

Crushing university
I am the queen
I've come to take the sweetness
Keeping down the make keep

Leave him with something sweet
He can't see soon

He won't say no, he won't say yes
He won't say no, he won't say yes

(BV: He won't say no)   Everybody knows
(BV: He won't say yes)  I've seen it with my eyes
(BV: He won't say no)   Everybody knows
(BV: He won't say yeah) I've seen it with my eyes



@SONG: Cherry

You smile, I desire
Lean on me, follow me
You smile, and it will be
That's the truth, answer
'Cause I am waiting
For the stars to change
It's only the talk of you
I've been patient
For the sun to change
It's only the need of you

[***]

I will be patient
For the sun to go down
'Cause I am waiting
For the stars to change




THE FAåT

@SONG: Faåt Accompli

Every day, there is some kind of darkness
That just won't go away, no matter how hard I try
It crawls into your system while your guard is down
Becomes a ball you like drag around to

Every party
To every function
To give to people with written instructions
Don't try to get away, I'm here to stay
My name is

(BV: Fate) [repeat 4]

Every night, sleep wanders on its own
Never once, does it kiss me, with its chloroform
Crawled into my system while my guard was down
Became the ball I like to have around at

Every party
At every function
I give it to people with written instructions
Don't try to get away, I'm here to stay
My name is your fate

(BV: Fate)

I've come to crush your bones    (BV: Fate)
I've come to make you feel old   (BV: Fate)
I've come to mess with your head (BV: Fate)
'Cause it'll make you feel good

I've come to make you feel good
I've come to make you feel good
I've come to make you feel good  (BV: all right)
I've come to make you feel good  (BV: all right)
I've come to make you feel good  (BV: all right)
I've come to make you            (BV: all right)

(BV: all right)
(BV: all right)

(BV: Fate) [repeat 9]
