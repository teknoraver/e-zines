                                 "ERRORS"
                             by THE GNN/DC/uXu

                 "In space no one can hear you scream..."
                                            (S.P.O.C.K)


  "Where did you see it?"

  The moglam pointed a small finger towards the desert. Then he ran away
in panic and disappeared into the maze of the yellow rocks. 
Robert turned around and looked the way the moglam had shown him. Nothing.
He didn't like the black desert. Chilly winds and dangerous animals
everywhere. For a while he thought about forgetting all about it and
return to his Mobile Jet hidden in the rocks and return to the base.
But he couldn't. He concentrated his mind and cocked the brain beam
gun. A red light on his left glove confirmed the action.
And he started to walk.

  The moglams had been quite harmless. If the humans just protected them from
the dangers on their planet they would accept a strategic base. Robert 
had been one of the first crews and he quickly got the job as an Moglam
Protector. It was an easy job. Every time a moglam needed help he would be
there. Moglams were stupid. They couldn't use a gun. They couldn't
kill. So every time a desert animal decided to get something to eat, they
were a good prey. 

  When the radio screamed that morning about a moglam sending emergency
signals via the PlanetCom he expected to find another animal rampaging
one of their villages. But when he came to the place where the signals had
been sent he just found an lonely moglam. No animal. When he asked about
what had got him to send the signals he just answered "Bright light! Hot!".

  The black sand of the desert was not especially nice to walk on. He didn't
want to use the Mobile Jet. He suspected that the "bright light" could be
a leak from the green nuclear pipeline placed in the desert. And that would
destroy the magnetic fields in the engine. His HUD radar didn't show any
animals around. Good. The only thing he wanted to do now was to walk for
half an hour and then return to the base with a "false alarm" report.
He knew that they could be watching him. He just had to do something that
looked good. After a while he reached the middle of the desert. In front
of him, he could see the yellow northern rocks. Behind him, the southern
rocks. He switched the HUD radar display to a view of all metals around.
The green nuclear pipeline was just below him. No leaks. 

  "Moglams..."

 He said some dirty words about the moglams and were just going to walk back
to the Mobile Jet when he saw the light. It came from the left horizon
towards him, flying over the desert. He had never seen anything like that in
his whole life. It was bright orange and flew between the southern and
northern mountains. He switched over to long-distance radar and discovered 
that the light travelled with an incredible high speed. It would reach him
in...less than thirty seconds. He would never make it to the safe rocks in
time. He regretted that he hadn't use the gun faster when the complete
system of his suit broke down. Everything got silent and dark. The sounds
of the wind blowing in the black desert reached his mind. He knew he
was going to die and that he couldn't do anything about it. The orange 
light came closer. He closed his eyes. Before the light burned him
to nothing he heard something. A scream. An electronic scream.

  The file would be his in a few minutes. He just had to wait. Downloading
is a necessary evil he used to say. But what was that? A sudden error on
the transfer?

  "What a worthless line..."
