    Phew! I must say that we have really been welcomed by the public out
    there. Our first release, only a month ago, have been noticed by a
    number of people, (who have responded in different ways but generally
    with a big "well done" greeting). Only one have "accused" us for 
    ripping off one of his works, Wrongly of course. We don't rip off
    other people's works, and if we did, we wouldn't copy it straight-
    off anyway (I mean, what's the point?!). We produce original files,
    with original contents by original authors. No more, no less.

    But lets not be diverted by that, and continue with this great #2
    release! The Short Index will keep growing, containing ALL releases
    from uXu. The Long Index will Only contain the latest release
    (the size of this file would otherwise be growing fast!). Just to
    give you a clue of what's in this 2nd release, I'd like to say it's
    our Crazy release. Not much concrete stuff, more of Weirdness.
    This is good. Why? you might ask. Well, I'd rather write weird new
    stuff than copy others files on Hacking XXX, Phreaking XXX, Carding
    XXX or like almost every "new" technical textfiles/rag do today.
    Weird is good! Weird is needed to survive today, so keep that
    weirdness grow!

    A couple of readers have responded to our search for new members
    and contributors, so I hope we will see some of their work in our
    next release. We have also managed to get some of the "professional"
    writers to consider contributing to uXu, so keep your eyes open
    for our next release.

    If You would like to join, contribute, or perhaps let your Board
    become a Distribution Site for uXu, check at the end of this file
    for boards where I (The Chief) can be reached, and write to me there
    for more information.

October  November  October  November  October  November Releases 1991:

016: "Preventing a Murder" by The Chief.   You think you've had bad days?
I don't think so. Just check this file out, written as it's happening,
making the most calm person want to kill someone. The system really can
crack you up. There's a limit on how much one can take.

017: "How To Cause Panic" by Phearless.   Take this first release from
our first contributor with you to those crowded places when you want to
cause some major panic. You heard of those English football riots? This
will learn you some tricks on how to 'match' that.

018: "Public Enemy - Apocalypse 91 Lyrics" by The Chief.   Public Enemy's
brand new album is so good, we decided to spread the lyrics. Everyone
should read these great texts. A true Mastermind (Chuck D) at work!
Also, buy the album! It's worth every cent!

019: "OOOOoooo!" by The Chief.   Have you ever wondered where the
expression "OOOOoooo!" came from? What caused it to be so popular among
the male population of a planet? This will answer your questions in a
very surprising and revealing way. Don't leave home without it!

020: "How To Shrink a Head" by The GNN.   This, hmm, individual, our
anarchy/terrorism expert, The GNN really works hard to get you new ideas
for your priceless head collection. This file will even make it easier
for you to store your collection in safer places! 

021: "The European Digest Vol.1 Issue #06" by The Chief.   The SCO Xenix
System V Tutorial Part 3! Yes, the chapter you've been waiting for. 
Including security and user accounts. Also, in the standard 'Recommended'
section we have some brain-damaging Drinks for you to try out, and in
the End Comments, we talk about views on the 'new' Phrack Issues.

022: "How To Kill an 'Elite' (in rhymes)" by The Chief.   Just put that
N.W.A "Niggaz4Life" on your player and sing along with The Chief. He
describes a way to end a so-called 'Elite' the truly nasty way. Parental
Advisory, Explicit Lyrics.

023: "Castle Chronicles Chapter One" by The Chief.   The Chief is back
with yet another fiction story, filled with self-admiration, humor and
lack of meaning in every way. Read about Steve Castle's hard trials,
trying to solve "The Man & No Man" Case in a 2x2 meter basement.
(don't worry, The Chief will be back with The BIG System in Release 3)

024: "Your Mini Guide To Master The Art of Chaos" by Phearless.   What's
the difference between Panic and Chaos? Phearless lets you in on the
secret, as well as giving you some very useful advice and tips on how
to start your own private hell for others.

025: "101 Uses For The "Tower of Power"" by The Chief.   Do you still
have that old XT in the basement or in the cupboard under the dirty
laundry? Dig it up! It can be used for 101 different things! Yes, how
fantastic that may seem, this file will let you know how.

026: "uXu Index #2" by The Chief.   The second index for those nice
uXu files. This second index includes all uXu releases in the Short
format, and the 11 new files in the Long format, as well as comments
by The Chief about what's happened since the last release, the member
and contributor lists, and as always, an updated list of boards where
to contact us.


             [#26 also includes an Index for the uXu-S series]
