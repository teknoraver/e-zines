*   The intro.           "One hundred and eighty!"

*   Sometimes, there are things not worth it, but then again, sometimes
*   there are, if you know what I mean? All one need to remember is,
*   that life is short and if you don't do it today, you might as well
*   drop it. Who knows what'll happen tomorrow? Each second is a new
*   one, and whatever comes next is uncertain. Think of it for a
*   second... See, you didn't know what was going to happen, did you. :)
*   Well well well.. enough personal thoughts, and on to this release.

*   A bundle of files and new submissions! Yes, we're happy to say
*   that there really _is_ an upswing in the contributor area these
*   days, and that, my friends, is really rewarding. We have Budha
*   and Greg Iloyd all the way from Brazil, Basehead, one of our
*   distribution site sysops and Brainiac, from Sweden as new entries
*   in the contributor section with files to match. The GNN roams the
*   keyboards with a set of files, Ralph 124C41+ finds himself writing
*   the final part of his Clean Shaven series and Hedge takes a look
*   at our society. Finally, the third part in the Castle Chronicles
*   series. That's it! Now, go on and read something, okay? :)


    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?

    True! All files (0-183) are available from the sites listed at the end
    of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 029,041,181,155,063

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's absolutely no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are stars (or
    multiplication characters) which let you know what's new since
    last time. You don't have to read through the whole index for
    the latest info, just scan the file for the stars.


                                     It's a cold February this year...
                                                       The Chief / uXu

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Support Board -->  To become a support board, we have to check your
                      BBS first, so include number/name/nup when applying.
                      As a support board, you'll have one file-area for
                      uXu files and one for files TO uXu, where only the
                      uXu editor (or errand-boy <g>) may download files.
                      Password protected files are okay too.

you're wrong. Just think about it for a second and you have the answer,
or read this one if you want to cheat.

174: "We Are The Robots" by Hedge.   This marks the return of the
creative and enlighted Hedge, with a file on our society, what
controls the average mind, and what could happen (or is happening)
when the government starts to pick up on it.

175: "Clean Shaven Beauty III" by Ralph 124C41+.   The final and last
part of these creamy stories with yet another astounding end that you
won't expect (or what do I know.. maybe you've figured Ralph out?).

176: "Operation Moon Sucker" by The GNN.   One damn fine story I'd
like to say. Hey, wait a minute. Did I say story? Hmm, well, it's
not completely fiction anyway. Some of these things really happened.
Yeah, believe it. We're from Sweden, remember?

177: "Get Free Stuph and Kill People!!!!!" by Basehead.   The
Overlord Power-Destructo-Death-Head's finest tricks and tips that
will do you good, if you decide to read this one that is. You
_do_ believe me, don't you?

178: "How To Talk With ET's..." by Budha & Greg Iloyd.   Feeling
a bit out of touch, I'm not sure how to describe this one. The
best thing would be to just let you read it and decide for yourself.
To be honest though, yes, it does have something to do with aliens.

179: "The Unpaid Workers of Politics" by Hedge.   Now, this is really
a sequel to the 'We Are The Robots' file, and rightly so too. Another
look at our society, from another angle, and on another subject. Makes
you think, and that is good.

180: "Wild West" by The GNN.   Yes we all know it, but most people
try to hide behind the shiny, flashy front. America? Land of the
free? The one who told you that is your enemy. Or what was it Rage
Against The Machine said?

181: "Castle Chronicles The Sequel - Chapter Three" by The Chief.   A
quick look at a dark page in Steve Castle's life. Yes, it is the third
part, and hopefully not the last (or I will be shot or sumpthin').
Continuing where part 2 left off.

182: "Who Knows?" by The GNN.   At this moment, this one isn't what
it originally was, and the reasons behind the change are not worth
to mention. Lets just say that it doesn't matter. Okay, it doesn't
matter.

183: "uXu Index #16" by The Chief.   No, it's hasn't changed. Why?
Well, probably because it's okay as it is, huh? :) Enough of that!
This is the index file, where you find news, updates on everything
worth updating, statistics (sort of), lists of places and people we
think you'd want to know about, a general hint to what them new files
are about (in case you're looking for something special, perhaps?),
and other assorted things. We'd like you to check out:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks and Honorary Member List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact uXu.

      [#183 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
