                              "EXCITING LIFE"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu

                          This one is for you, J.

       
  She  thought  that the normal life sounded boring.  Childhood, education,
work  and  finally  death.  That could possibly not be everything that life
had to offer her.
  I  want  to do something extra in my life, she said to the realists.
  The  realists  were  everywhere.   They  were  teachers,  social workers,
parents  and  a  dozen  more  of well-educated experienced people that knew
exactly how everything worked.  Nothing more, nothing less.
  My life will be something special.  I will sail on the seven seas, I will
travel  to  the  end of the universe.  I do not want to work on some boring
factory  for  my  whole  life.  I want to enjoy myself.  Adventure, action,
anything - as long as I stay away from the boredom and the normal life.
  Her  eyes  shined with hope.  Only seventeen years old, the life had just
begun for her.  In her mind, something had happened.  Suddenly, she was not
the pretty young girl who did what her parents told her to do.  Now she was
on her way to grow up.  Fast.
  Listen  to  me,  she said to the realists.  Help me to realize my dreams.
Only  you  can  do it.  If I try on my own, everything will fail.  The only
thing I want from you is to encourage me.
  The  realists  looked  at each other.  Their sharp, dark costumes were as
strict as their faces.  No one smiled.  No one said anything.
  Our  lives are short, she continued.  Look at you.  You have done nothing
in your lives, except for following some traditional path that leads to the
end.   I do not want to do that.  I will do anything that takes me off that
path.   I  have  still got the opportunity to chose and I will certainly do
so.   No  one can stop me.  Look at the blue sky, look at the birds who fly
there.   They are free.  I want to join them.  People must remember me as a
free  bird  who  experienced  the exciting life.  No one has ever said that
everybody  must work, or must do as everybody else.  Those who do that have
failed.   If  someone  will succeed in living the good life, it will be me.
Me!   I see visions of the future.  I can see myself struggling through the
jungle,  writing novels, travelling to the bottom of the sea and walking on
streets in cities that never sleep.
  Will  you  help  me?   Will  you  help  me  with  my  dreams?  Nothing is
impossible, everything goes.
  Someone  loudly  cleared the throat.  The realists opened their mouth and
spoke.  Their voices were without any signs of feelings.
  Life is short.  Life is work.  What you do is what you are.  When we were
young,  we  had the same childish attitude to life as you have now.  But we
grew up and realized that not everything is possible.  You live and that is
enough.   Turn  on the television and share other peoples adventures.  Feel
the  excitement  that other people experience.  But do not imagine that you
will succeed with anything special.  If you do that, failure will feel even
more painful.  Live as we tell you to do, and everything will work out just
fine.   You will die as everybody else.  Naturally, not everybody will have
the  chance  to  experience  the exciting life.  Do not make all of us feel
bad.   Live  as we have done - that will be best for all of us.  Follow the
rules, do not question them.  Sooner or later, you will accept them anyway.
  They expected her face to be sad.  But she was in a rage.
  Get  lost,  you  dusty old piles of crap.  You know nothing.  You are all
far behind me.  I will never be like you.
  The  chair  fell to the floor as she violently got to her feet and ran to
the door.
  I  will never be like you, she said again.  I now understand that my only
chance  is to help myself.  You will envy me when you meet me next time.  I
will  search  and  find the good life.  I will do anything, as long as I do
not become like you.
  The door slammed shut.  She was gone.  The realists shook their heads and
continued  to work.  They saw her again a long time later.  Her blonde hair
was  dirty, her face was old and her smile was gone.  Without help, she had
tried to find the good life.  She was not as everybody else.
  She was addicted to heroine.
