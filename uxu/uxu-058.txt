                                 WHAT IS THIS?!
    _______________________________________________________________________

    Let me explain. For some time now, the members of uXu have discussed a
    new idea; to have some sort of award for good textfiles. Maybe you feel
    this is a bad idea, but actually it's really needed today. Here's why;

    *) We all know there's 1000's and 1000's of textfiles out there, right?
       Some good, some bad. Some copied from old ones, and some brand new.
       A lot of files with different names, which really are copies or just
       the same old files, just renamed.

       Here's four questions for ya..

       1) How can we lower the rate of copied/reproduced/renamed files?
       2) How can we tell if a file is new or old before downloading it?
       3) How do we know which files are authentic/informative/useful?
       4) How can we get great new files & have fun at the same time?

       The answer: We start a Textfile-writer's Awards Competition!

       I know you now have a lot of questions and still don't think this
       is a good idea, but please, read through this file, and if you
       then still feel the same, ok.

    I bet all of us have downloaded duplicates, copies, renamed files,
    or just plain bad files. I counted my duplicates and found that
    about 20% of my files were renamed/copied ones. When it comes to
    counting bad files, I'm not the one to judge for everyone else, but
    for myself, for me, about 30% of my textfiles were useless old junk.
    If I wrote how much money was spent on downloading these files, you'd
    start to see the benefits of such a Competition we're trying to start.

    If I knew the files were bad/copies BEFORE I downloaded them, ok.
    Then I could blame no-one but myself. If I knew that THOSE files
    had been awarded, then I'd know they can't be duplicates, and I'd
    know that they're new. I can trust those who voted the files to be
    good if I'd like, and I can find out for myself (it's a personal
    judgement) but I'd still know that it's new material and not some
    old junk.

    I could go on and on about this, but I hope by now you begin to
    understand what I'm getting at.

    _______________________________________________________________________

                                    THE PLAN
    _______________________________________________________________________

    Here's how we planned to do this; (example: 1992)

        1) From 01-Jan-92 until 30-Nov-92: Nothing happens.

        2) From 01-Dec-92 until 15-Dec-92: Those who want to participate
           in the competition starts to upload their textfiles to the
           (later) listed AWARD boards. BUT ALSO;


           BIG NOTE: Anyone can upload textfiles for the competition!
           --------- If you have found a file that you think is great,
                     then why not give it a chance and send it in?
                     You don't have to be the author of the file!
                     But please note: THE AUTHOR's handle and a BBS
                     where he/she can be located MUST come with each
                     file! If that info is missing, we delete the file.

           NOTE 2:   The file MUST have been written during 1992!
           -------

        3) From 16-Dec-92 until 20-Dec-92: We (the members of uXu) collect
           the files from the AWARD boards and distribute them to those
           who are to vote (the judges).

                  NOTE: The Judges are those who were placed 1-3
                        in each genre the year before, so there's
                        a mixture of new judges each new year.

           The first year (this year), we in uXu have taken it upon us
           to be the judges, to start the whole thing, and therefor we
           won't vote for our own files which is only fair and the way
           it is, so we're counting on YOU to participate this first
           time, and to be the first to receive an award!

        4) From 21-Dec-92 until 31-Dec-92: The judges have time to read
           the files and to vote. They will select 10 files from each
           genre (see GENRES below), and award them with points from
           1-10. 10 for the best of course, 9 for the second best, and
           so on. Only ONE file/genre can get 10, only ONE can get 9,
           and so on, from each judge.

        5) From 01-Jan-93 until 05-Jan-93: We (the uXu members) collect
           the votes and count them. Then we make a top-list and release
           a Writer's Awards file with all the participating authors/
           files listed and their positions. Also included, the comments
           (if any) from the judges, and the normal chat around the awards.
           We also list each judges top-10, so they can check that we're
           not cheating, or changing the points awarded.

        6) 06-Jan-93: The 3 files from each genre that got the highest
           points are released with a "## PLACE IN THE 1992 WRITER'S AWARDS"
           mark in a new WINNERS Textfile-Series. No-one but the Authors
           become famous.

        The next year (1993) those 9 authors (three from each genre) who
        won in 1992, will be the judges, and can of course participate
        again if they like to. And then it starts from 1) again.

    _______________________________________________________________________

                            SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
    _______________________________________________________________________

    Now that you have read this far, what do you think about it? Doesn't it
    sound like fun? We can get a top-class textfile-series with the best of
    the best textfiles, from the greatest authors/writers, who gets credit
    where credit is due. It's a challenge for those who really work with
    their files, and it's a sure thing for those who appreciate good files,
    because
                               ANYBODY CAN WIN!

    Important: GENRES

    We plan to have THREE different genres to get some sort of order, and
    to make sure we're covering all interests out there. These are the
    genres:
                                 1) Fiction 
                                 2) Underground
                                 3) Everything else

    1) FICTION -> This genre cover Stories. Good fiction/real life stories.

    2) UNDERGROUND -> Here we have the big ones; Hacking, Phreaking, Anarchy,
                      Alchemy and whatever you might come up with from the
                      underground.

    3) EVERYTHING ELSE -> You just write whatever you want. This genre is
                          for everything not covered by the two others.
                          Like for example, Lyrics, Homework, Weird stuff
                          etc.

    So, each genre has its winner, 2nd placed and 3rd placed file. This means
    we'll have three winners, three 2nd placed and three 3rd placed files
    each year. So whatever your topic is, you've got a chance to win.

    Also Very Important: It doesn't matter if the file has been released
    already during the year in some other way. If the Author's handle and
    a BBS where he/she can be contacted is sent with the file, and it has
    been released the same year, the file can participate.

    For example (1992):

      1) You read a file which is written/released during 1992 which you
         think is great. The file contains the Authors Handle & a BBS 
         where he/she can be contacted.

      => The file CAN participate in the Writer's Awards.


    Another example (1992):

      1) You read a file which has been written/released BEFORE 01-Jan-92
         which you think is great. The file contains the Authors Handle
         & a BBS where he/she can be contacted.

      => The file CAN'T participate in the 1992 Writer's Awards.


    Another example (1992):

      1) You write a file during 1992 and send it in with your handle and
         a BBS where you can be contacted.

      => You CAN participate with that file in the 1992 Writer's Awards.

                      --------------------------------

      The file MUST come with the Author's Handle & a BBS where he/she
      can be contacted! Otherwise, the file is automatically disqualified!

      The file HAS to be Written during the same year as the current Awards.
      A file written BEFORE 1992 can't participate in the 1992 Writer's
      Awards. A file written before 1993 can't participate in the 1993
      Writer's Awards. Easy to understand, right?

                      --------------------------------
