                               INTRODUCTION.

  The 'Lock-Clicker' could be called a poor man's pick gun since it is very
easy  to  build  and  will  not  cost  you  anything,  except  for  a  wire
coat-hanger.  I can bet one million dollar that this little device has been
described in several files already, since the original clicker was invented
in  the  early  1950s (at that time it was sold to private detectives).  It
still  works  mighty  fine  and should not be seen as out of date.  Since I
have  not  seen  any files myself about this excellent device, I decided to
write  about  it.   We cannot have too much information anyway, can we?  By
the  way, I would like to thank a dutch guy who called himself "The Key" at
the  Hacking at the End of the Universe conference, august 1993.  He taught
me  the  art of lock-picking and I hope that I some day will become as good
as he is.
  Now  then,  let  me  describe  for  you how to make and use this charming
little  picker.   However,  this  file  requires  that you already own some
knowledge  of  lock-picking,  i.e  know how to use a tensioner and know the
theory behind picking.


  This is what you will need...


  1.  STEEL WIRE COAT-HANGER
  2.  BROOM HANDLE
  3.  FILE
  4.  HAMMER
  5.  PLIERS

  ...and to use the picker you will also require...
                                                    __
  6.  A lock-picking tensioner.  You know, this:      \
                                                       \
                                                        \



                       HOW TO MAKE THE LOCK CLICKER.

  At  first, you need to straighten out the hanger so it will become a long
straight  wire.   Cut  of  the  hook  of the hanger before you do it.  When
finished it should look like this:




   ---------------------------------------------------------------

                                                (cool eh?)




  Well, that was not so hard, was it?  Now then, this thing requires a loop
that  will  function as a spring.  Wrap the wire one turn and a half around
the broom handle.
  Now it should look something like this:




                     / 
                    /
                   /
                  / 
                 /
  (upper wire)  /
               /
              /
             / 
            /
           /                  
         //\\
        //  \\
        \\  //
         \\/--------------------------------------

     (loop)           (lower wire)


        |-----------------------------------------|
                  (about 12-15 centimeters)




  Almost  there.   Now  use  the  pliers to bend the upper wire down to the
lower  and  then  bend  it  up  again,  around the lower wire, so a hook is
created.   A  picture  says  more  than a thousand words, so here is how it
should look when you have done that:




                   (upper wire)
              ________________
             /               |
            /                |
           /                 |
         //\\                | 
        //  \\               | 
        \\  //               |  /
         \\/-----------------|--------------------
                             |/           (needle part)
        (loop)   (lower)   (hook)            




  Blow  the needle part of the picker with the hammer until it turns into a
flattened blade.  Then use the file to shape the blade into a pick needle.

  Congratulations, you are now a proud owner of the fancy Lock Clicker!




                         HOW THE HELL DO I USE IT?

  Rather  obvious  I  think.  Insert the Clicker and the tensioner into the
lock.   Hold  the clicker in the palm of you hand and use the thumb to pull
down  the  upper  wire so when the thumb is released, the hook snaps upward
and  hits  the  lower  wire.   The needle will snap upward and hit the pins
inside  the  lock.   The lower pins in the lock will hit the upper pins and
send  them  all on a short ride inside the lock.  The tensioner will notice
that the pins are away and open the lock.
  To make sure that you got it, let me draw another crappy picture:




                    1. Use your thumb to snap here.

                       |
                       |
                      \|/
              ________________
             /               |             3. The needle will snap upward.           
            /                |                
           /                 |                 |
         //\\                |                 |
        //  \\               |                \|/
        \\  //               |  /             
         \\/-----------------|--------------------
                             |/              
                             
 
                            /|\ 
                             |
                             |

                          2. The hook will be snapped upward,
                             against the lower wire.




  If  you  are  into  rapping  locks,  you will find this picker to be very
useful  since  it  works  on the same theory, but in a more...  'automatic'
way.   The  Lock Clicker, of course, requires training.  You must determine
how hard you need to snap different locks and how much tension needed.  You
can count yourself as 'very good', when you can open a lock with one single
snap.

  I  have  managed to open many different locks with this wonderful picker.
Trust  me, it works perfectly.  It can never be as good as a real pick gun,
but who can afford them anyway?
