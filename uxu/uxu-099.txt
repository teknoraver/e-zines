                                  Waiting
                       Sitting, looking for my game

                                Every night
                          Sit, hide, run or seek

                                  Thrill
                      I love, even if it is the same

                                   Must
                       Give my victims a fatal leak

                                 Thinking
                        The press gave me the name

                                  Madman
                           With a knife, a freak

                                  Walking
                             Towards, she came

                                  Stabbed
                       Once, almost heard her speak




                                    Yes
                      Blood, that feeling never fail

                                 Screaming
                               People see me

                                   Noise
                    Running feet, try to put me in jail

                                    Why
                   Jealous, I am what they wanted to be

                                 Soundless
                       Sneak away on my hidden trail

                                  Really
                     She's better off dead, isn't she

                                  Coming
                        Next time I'll try the nail




                                   Fate
                       This is what I am bound to do

                           "OVER AND OVER AGAIN"
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu





                                WHY WHY WHY

                              I asked myself

                                    WHY

                     - There was no other alternatives

                                    But

                                    WHY

                                    WHY

                             did I have to do

                                    WHY

                              the dirty work

                                    WHY

     could God not simply kill her/them/all of them in a car accident

                                and help me

                                    WHY

                              To end MY pain!

                    But there was no other alternatives

                                 I knew it

                             Everybody know it

  But they are prisoned in their shells and dare
  not to speak the truth.

                                   I do

                                  I know

                               And I did it!

                              Guns guns guns

             a tool made BY the human race FOR the human race

                      it serves us (it serves me!)

                                   Begin

                                   hide

                                   shoot

                                   end 

                                   End?

                                  I grow!

  Papers next day - another victim for this homicidal
  maniac. Maniac. Maniac. I am not a maniac. I grow.
  The strongest survive - with the help from the weak.

                        She was weak I am strong

                         but I can grow stronger.

                                 Feed me!

                        her and her and her and her

                        The pain returns next day

                                 (oh shit)

               before the night falls, it will be gone again

  I do not ask myself WHY any more. Because, I know WHY.
