CHAPTER ELEVEN                                                   CHAPTER ELEVEN
__________________________________ANDROMEDA 22_________________________________


      Andromeda 22 was seen as a  glowing ball of fire after it's  sudden
      and unexplainable appearance to the surprise of Earth's astronomers
      and scientists.

      You  could barely see it as a  small red  spot with  your eyes, but
      through Earth's  best  observatory on the island of Lunai,  not far
      from  Hawaii, it  could  be  observed  with  careful  and  powerful
      strength.

      The  Soviet  republic  and  the  United States of America had  been
      cooperating with  space  exploration  for  a  long  time, to  reach
      further together without unnecessary and often dangerous
      competition.

      When the space station  SATCON 7  was built, the cooperation became
      stronger than before.  Seven Americans and  nine Soviets now worked
      together on the station,  placed near one of  Jupiter's many moons,
      IO.

      Steve Spingleman was one of the astronomers  and scientists who now
      had gathered  at the observatory to, if not exchange theories about
      A-22, to start a cooperation to get much closer to it.

      China was  the  nation that had a  space  station  closest to A-22,
      right between the planet and Earth. The station, ZUR, wasn't manned
      but was built to  handle a crew of five.  The  distance was a major
      factor.  Journeys from the Earth to the station, whichever it would
      be,  would  demand  large  amounts of  money in transportation  and
      communication.  If ZUR was to be  used, the costs  were cut to half
      comparing to if they were to use SATCON 7, because it was placed on
      the other side of A-22, between A-22 and Jupiter.

      Communication  was the  second most  important factor. If you could
      cut the  distance in half, you  also cut the  delay in time in half.
      The delay was a major  problem when working with  these  incredible
      distances. Of course plasma  energy was  used  which almost reached
      lightspeed, but  the  delay could  still be about two hours if they
      used SATCON 7 instead of just one hour or less with ZUR.


      The  third  factor was the crew.  China  had  many of  Earth's best
      astronomers,  but ZUR could  only take five  persons. SATCON 7 took
      fifteen...

CHAPTER TWELVE                                                   CHAPTER TWELVE
__________________________________EASY SCHOOL__________________________________

      Fifteen  minutes  after I had put the  phone down the error-test of
      The Metro was complete. Through my home-built error-checking system
      I found  a small  but not  harmless  fault.  A  quick change of the
      vacuum-freezed  number generator that  handled the  identification-
      process  with  XX EXPRESS  modems and  everything  seemed  to  work
      all right.

      A quick  look  at the  watch told me that I wouldn't be able to try
      The Metro the same day.  "School" was about to start and with it an
      essay which I'd forgotten.  The subject  was  "Computer fear in the
      20th century". Info Addict was bound to have what I was looking for,
      so  I called it up and  started to go  through the massive  bank of
      information.

      Computer Anarchists, Computers & Cooking,  Computer Evacuations, ah,
      Computer Fear!  A large file of 150 pages plus thirteen other files
      covering subjects not close, but close enough to Computer fear.

      I lazered them over and  copied a  little bit of each file into one,
      made a few  changes and ended  up with  an  80-page  essay  in  six
      minutes. Sure, it wasn't very honest, but when everything's already
      written, and is accessible,  why bother to write it again?  You get
      my point?  Well,  I fed my essay into the school-drome  and got the
      result 10 seconds later  with  an "A".  The "School" took about two
      hours, then it was time for dinner and after that, the beach party.
      No, I hadn't  forgot  about  Megan.  That  was  exactly  what I was
      thinking about.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN                                               CHAPTER THIRTEEN
___________________________2 COMPUTERS, ALL IN ONE_____________________________

      Spingleman's assignment was to build the computer that would handle
      the  journey, most of the  observations and  even be able to handle
      the whole  operation itself if it was necessary, but the time-delay
      factor made it almost impossible, but only  "almost". The  computer
      would need instructions from Earth and quick decisions was crucial,
      the slightest  mistake could ruin the operation.  Human  assistance
      would therefor take care of that problem.

      Spingleman could stake all his knowledge on that the computer would
      manage  all predictable and  unpredictable situations  even without
      human help,  but  everyone didn't  share his trust in computers, so
      they decided on human assistance as a "safety net".

      When Spingleman had  been  contacted by the WSA three weeks ago, he
      had been  working on the GCEC project, but had to drop that for the
      new  computer.  Now three  weeks  later,  his  standard  prototype,
      connected  with a  couple of XX EXPRESS modems to the telephone net
      back  home had been  upgraded so it  contained  both  projects. His
      customers were delighted  to try out not one, but two new computers
      at the same time, adding their  wants and needs to their lists from
      both computers.

      Of course, this  was  only  known to  himself  and  his  customers,
      because no-one else had access to the prototype, or at least SHOULD
      have access to it.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN                                               CHAPTER FOURTEEN
_______________________________BEACH PARTY PANIC_______________________________

      Dinner was  quickly  finished  and it was time to  walk down to the
      beach and the  party. It had started  about  an hour ago, but would
      surely  last the  whole night so I didn't need to hurry, and.. then
      it was that thing with Megan..

      Ten minutes later I was at the beach with a large drink in my hand.
      I noticed my sister and her friends but not Megan. Maybe she'd been
      held-up  and couldn't come? Well,  I managed to find a couple of my
      friends and sat down to talk a bit. It was Rob  (Robert, who shared
      my interest in computers), Patrick, generally called  The Professor
      because he could always come up with the  most unusual and hard-to-
      get  facts  just  like he  had added another 20-Terrabyte HD to his
      brain. Then there was Mimi, whom I had grown up with and her friend
      Marcelline who I didn't know too well.

      We sat there and  talked  about  everything.  The party, the latest
      rumors, well,  whatever  came up. After a while we needed  some new
      drinks, so we decided to walk  around and see what was happening on
      the beach. A couple  of bands played and we  stayed for a moment to
      listen, and then started to walk towards the big fireplace.

      And then, I ran into Megan...

CHAPTER FIFTEEN                                                 CHAPTER FIFTEEN
__________________________________THE MEETING__________________________________

      Right after the end of the meeting, the very impatient Dr Spingleman
      was called to the  WSA presidential's office.  His office, placed at
      the top of the magnificent SPACE COMMISSION building was The largest
      office in the whole building, because it covered the complete top.

      The building was  described as a 220 meter high black building, made
      of the material found on  the Moon  a couple  of years earlier.  The
      material,  called  'Lunar'  was  the latest word  in strength and it
      didn't  reflect any light.  The sunlight  that  hit the building was
      absorbed  and  converted  into pure  energy.  The  building therefor
      didn't need outside  sources to  get light, heat, or  power for it's
      massive amount of electronics. It was a magnificent sight.

      Big black doors (in the 3m class) opened when the guard received the
      word to let Spingleman in. Behind the doors, a man sat with his back
      turned against  Spingleman in a big  black chair.  The man seemed to
      enjoy a good cigar of the latest artificial tobacco-free brands.

      When Spingleman got closer he recognized the worried look of his old
      friend, staring out a big black window, and seemed to be far away.

      - Frank?, Spingleman said clearing his throat.

      - Steve! I'm glad you could make it. Sit down, sit down.

      Frank  Stechnykov's  troubled look vanished, replaced by  warmth and
      frankness.

      - It must have been..., Stechnykov hesitated, 10 years? Well, time
      really flies!

      - No no, Steve said making himself comfortable in a big black chair,
      it'll be 15 years next year, but you're still the same. The only
      change I notice is that round...

      - Hahaha, Stechnykov thundered, You know Jeanie's food is unresistable.
      It's really good to see you again Steve, he said and commented
      Spinglemans beard with just as much irony.

      After they'd covered what had happened the last 15 years, Stechnykov
      started to come to the reason why Spingleman hadn't been cleared to
      attend the meeting earlier that day.

      - China wants to do research by themselves, and have no intentions to
      let us in on it or to cooperate. He puffed a few rings of smoke before
      he continued. The Operation must therefor be run from SATCON 7, as you
      already know, which makes the whole thing much more complicated, plus
      the competition that surely will be dangerous. It isn't just the 
      increased distance...

      Stechnykov had that worried look again. He raised from his chair and
      pressed a black button on his desk. Spingleman's chair rotated 90
      degrees, facing a big black wall. Stechnykov went up to the wall and
      turned to Spingleman.

      - What you're about to see is classified and has top priority in
      top security issues. This is, as you will see, a very delicate
      situation. Everything said in this room from now on must stay here.

      Spingleman nodded and Stechnykov pressed another black button. The
      room was now totally black. Big black shutters covered the windows
      and not a shred of light could enter the room.  A big CCVS Screen
      (Computer Crystal VideoScreen) lit up with a picture of SATCON 7.
      A voice started to tell the story.
