                                "THE VOICE"
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
                                 

  Strix ran through the corridors with the paper in his hand. The three
legs wouldn't go fast enough. He reached The Office, stopped and took
and deep breath. Then he opened The Door to The office and entered.
Faces looked at him from every part of a round table in the middle of
the room.

  "Well Strix, any news?"

  He held the paper high in the air so everybody could see it. It
contained strange numbers and words that no one could understand.

  "We did it! We have discovered another planet with life!"

  Chaos. The Leaders jumped high in the air, danced on the table and
screamed in happiness. Strix felt like joining them but realized that
it wasn't a good idea. He was just a Student of the sy-77 School Of
Investigation Of Uninvestigated Places In The Universe. The Leaders
would probably take it personal if he identified himself with them.
They calmed down after a few minutes and returned to their places with
stone cold faces.

  "Good Strix. Investigate their messages and return."

  They had worked with the problem for years. Signals, unknown to their
machines had been detected from a small planet far away. The problem
was that they couldn't prove if it was mutated echoes from their own
equipment or messages from another world. They worked night and day,
with all four arms working at the same time, to solve the problem.

  "Anything new?", Strix asked as he returned to the room. 

  Hi-tech equipment was placed everywhere. He had to step over five 
boosters to the main Detector when he wanted to enter his seat.
Mr Nagy Nagy looked at him. 

 "Nope. Just the ordinary sounds. They must be voices, but the new
 translation module hasn't arrived yet. I don't get a shit of what
 they are saying."

  Strix placed the ear to the loudspeaker and listened. Yes, it must be
voices. But what on Hil could it be saying? Mr Nagy Nagy continued.

 "We have discovered another interesting thing. We can hear other voices
 at the same time, but weaker. I think it can be amateurs who are 
 sending messages to space at the same time. Who knows? Then there's
 many different people who speak on the same frequency as the one
 that's the strongest. The main speaker is however the one we hear
 most...eh...aggressive...he must be the one who we should translate
 when the module arrives!"

  Strix nodded. Strange that they hadn't heard anything from the planet 
earlier. They had scanned that system before.
The Universal Translation Module arrived the very next day by speed-
mail from The Universal Translation School. It was a handy machine
with a microphone in one end and a printer in the other. 

  "Damn! Why isn't that voice sending now!", Mr Nagy Nagy said desperately.

  "Calm Down!", Strix replied. "You know they are not sending all the
  time! We just have to wait until they begin again!"

  Strix understood Mr Nagy Nagys impatience. This was the day. They tried
to kill time by playing cards but Mr Nagy Nagy couldn't concentrate. 
He ran to the loudspeaker all the time and listened.

  "Ahh...mmm...nothing yet!"

  After one hour the voice suddenly begun to speak. They threw everything
they had in their hands and rushed to the module. 

  "Turn it on for gods sake! Place the mic to the speaker! Quick!"

  Strix already knew what to do. He placed the module to the speaker and
turned it on. The machine listened and begun to translate.
They read the text that slowly came from the machine with a joy that
quickly transformed into fear. 

  He walked to The Office with slow steps. This was not good at all.
He explained to The Leaders that the messages had been destructive
ones, who kept talking about death and war. They shook their heads
and mumbled disappointed words. 

  "We cannot take the risk to make contact with them!", one of The Leaders
said. "They can be dangerous!"

  Everybody agreed. One turned to Strix and said:

  "Place the planet on the black list and send it to all other known
  systems! It must be kept isolated!"

  Strix did as they said. He sent a message to all other systems with a 
warning to stay away from the planet. When he returned to the room
he saw Mr Nagy Nagy packing the tapes and papers with the voice into
a box. 

  "Going to the cellar.", he said with a sad look.

  Strix stepped over a booster and picked up a tape.

  "I'm just going to listen to them for the last time."

  Mr Nagy Nagy stopped his packing and listened too with a calm face.
For the last time, they listened to the voice that they had discovered.
They didn't understand anything of it without the module, except that
it was a dangerous voice.
