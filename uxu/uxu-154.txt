                        Suicidal Maniac's Shitty File

    Introduction
    ------------

        Well, I'm sure that most of you folks are saying who  the  fuck  is
    this guy.  But, there are a few of you who are saying, hey, I know this
    guy.  So let's talk about who I am.
        I'm  a  veteran  to the p/h world, long since retired.  My alias is
    Suicidal Maniac.  I ran Condemned Reality BBS a few years ago, which in
    its time was one of the largest and busiest BBSes in the p/h world.
        The demise of an underground guru comes in one of two ways,  he  or
    his  BBS  gets busted or he burns out.   I kept my shit straight and my
    BBS standing on the line between legal and  illegal,  so  obviously,  I
    ended up burning out.
        My history with uXu dates back from the very beginning of uXu.  The
    Chief  was  a  member  in good standing on my BBS when he approached me
    about becoming the US HQ for uXu.  I was at that time K-C0W  board  and
    the NoT HQ, but uXu looked really interesting to me.  The Chief already
    had  more  than  20  releases in a very short time of existence.  So, I
    took the chance on the new kids on the block (no  offense,  this  isn't
    meant to be a pun), and put the uXu shit up and ready to go.
        Wouldn't  you  know  that uXu started becoming a large enough force
    that I was getting new callers from all over the globe calling  because
    they had gotten my number off of a uXu file.
        So,  basically in this introduction I would like to give a hats off
    to The Chief for the enormous work he has done for the underground.   I
    have  to  admit, before I saw these uXu guys come around, I thought the
    p/h underground was dying.  Phearless and The  Chief  appeared  on  the
    scene with more enthusiasm than anyone in the underground.
        Although  I  do not directly participate in the underground anymore
    through the BBSes, I do get the files from the FTP sites.   I  can  see
    just  by  looking at the number of files being produced  that  uXu  has
    given  the  other underground groups a swift kick in the ass.  It seems
    that everyone is producing now.

        To end this introduction, I would like  to  say  that  I  would  be
    interested in receiving mail over the internet from anyone that used to
    be on Condemned Reality that has access to the internet.  And one other
    thing,  Splice,  if  you  are out there, try to contact me. My internet
    mail address is a360681362@sysa.c-engr1.siu.edu, so send me  some  mail
    and let me know what's new.


    Section I -
    ---------

    You  may  have  seen  some of my work published by the cDc, COD, AA, or
    NoT, but here's some things that are new, or old stuff that hasn't been
    published.  This section is all poetry.


    Slice

    Iron clad maidens
    Falling in line.
    Entering a state of madness.

    Hysteria strikes....
    Wandering uterus,
    Migrating through
    the polluted systems.

    Symbol of life
    Out of control,
    Influenced behavior.
    The symbol of death.

    Vital functions blocked
    by its passage.
    Running through the blood.

    Morbid bodies, all with jobs.

    The Mirror

    Looking out at another shapeless day
    I decided to take a walk.

    While pondering the pages of my mind,
    I ran into two friends of mine.
    One named conformity,
    The other named individuality.

    They asked if I may help them.
    A disagreement they were in.
    Fighting over expression through each other.

    They can see each other
    in themselves.
    A mirror.


    Enter into the world of my friend.
    Individuality strikes us all.
    For that brief moment,
    Entering into life from the womb.
    Our life is undetermined for a
    Fine fine hair of time.
    We are without identity.
    We are ourselves.

    The other friend, it's his world.
    A world of black and white television.
    Monaural sound, bells that do not ring.
    The smell of fresh air is non-existent.
    Conformity strikes us after birth.
    We are tagged so as not to get lost.

    While overviewing the disagreement I ran into another friend.
    His name is insanity.
    He claims he can walk through the mirror.

    Insanity is a hallucination.
    Seeing someone else
    In the mirror of life.
    Driving backwards through
    The lanes of the living highway.
    Running in the mirror,
    without a reflection.

    Throughout the disagreement we seem to have forgotten a friend.
    His name is society.
    Society says there is no mirror.

    Very well we all say.
    I never saw the mirror.


    Me, I'm superstition.
    I broke the mirror.

    Some may confuse me with insanity.
    Yes, we look much alike.
    I break all the mirrors I see.
    I tell you this, never trust the mirror.
    It lies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Ritual

    Come, let's join hands.
    Eat the paper
    It won't hurt you.

    The ground is spinning,
    Reality slips away.

    You feel a breeze,
    As your spirit leaves you.
    You're outside now,
    Floating in the air.

    Hold my hand tightly,
    We're beginning to merge.
    An orgasmic grip tightens
    Around your waist.

    Our souls are one now,
    Let's make the journey.

    Your body below us
    Slowly drifts away.
    We soar above the mountains,
    And into the desert.

    Everything flushes red.
    A voice calls, "I am lonely."
    The voice continues "Will you dance with me?"

    "Who are you, where are you?"
    "I am no one.  Will you dance with me?"
    "Where am I?  Where are you?"
    "You are nowhere."
    "Where are you?"
    "I am everywhere."

    Entering Nirvana you peak.
    The journey is set in reverse.

    Reality focuses in.
    The world is gray.

    Section II -
    ----------

        Ok, a lot of files I've been seeing lately have been  about  what's
    cool  and  what's not.  Well, I'd just like to say one thing, those are
    all opinions, and that's it.  I'd like to express a few opinions myself
    in this section.


    II.a - Respect
    --------------
        It seems that some of the lamer 14 year old dorks that get on a few
    p/h boards like to brag about how they sent  a  virus  to  a  local  PD
    board.   What  I want to say about this is, you're a fucking dork.  The
    only time that it should be acceptable to send somebody a virus  is  if
    they  do something to you personally.  Nobody should have the idea that
    PD boards must die.  They have their niche in the computer  world  just
    as much as the underground.  They also have every right to exist.


    II.b - Music
    ------------
        I've  seen  all  kinds  of shit in files about if you  listen  to a
    certain kind of music, you are a true dork.  Only rap  and  alternative
    are  cool  now.   Ok, I listen to alternative, but let's  face  it  rap
    SUCKS!   I'll  take  Ministry,  Skinny  Puppy, or STP anyday over Snoop
    Doggy Dog.  I went through my rap phase.  That was part of growing  up.
    It  was  NWA, Public Enema, and the Geto Fags back then.   Then I began
    to realize that all the gangsta rappers were a bunch of losers who made
    money that other people were more deserving of.
        I  listen  to a great variety of music.  There's no law saying that
    it's only cool to listen to rave groups and shit like that.   I  listen
    to as much classic rock as I do metal and rave.


    II.c - How to tell if you are a dork
    ------------------------------------
        Ok,  everybody  stop writing these fucking files.  I think that the
    last one of these files that was truly enjoyed was written in  1986  or
    1987.   The  idea  has gotten old.  Everybody can tell a dork when they
    see one, and most likely, the person also knows they are a dork.  There
    is no need for a fucking definition file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Well folks, it's been interesting to put a file out again.  Hopefully,
    I'll be able to do some more writing and either submit it to the cDc or
    uXu for publishing.
        I hope you liked this file, if you didn't, FUCK YOU!

        This is Suicidal Maniac saying, "If you can't sack 'em, slap 'em!"
