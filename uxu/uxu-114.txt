                            ELITE MODEMTRADERS
                          by THE GNN/DualCrew/uXu
 
           "I despise you.
            I despise your order, you false-propped authorithy.
            Hang me for it!!!"
                                  (Louis Lingg, 1898)
 
 
               Aspects upon the "elite modemtrading scene".
 
 
  It  is easy to build castles made out of air and if you get several other
people  to  do  it - the castles turns real!  For several years the "scene"
was  a  place made for the people who got some kind of programming, drawing
or  musical  skills.   However,  this also got the attention of the unlucky
ones  who  because  of  the  lack  brainpower  or intelligence could not do
anything at all.
  These  were  the  so-called  "swappers".   However, let us not call these
people  unnecessary  for the "scene".  They had a key-function in spreading
the  demo  productions.   Spreading  by  mail is a rather tough work and it
costs  money.   But  it  sure have a certain charm and the swappers were in
harmony with the rest of the "scene".
  Now  we  live in a modern age and the swappers have gone modern too, with
high-speed  modems.   But something else has happened.  The "swappers" have
turned  "elite".   Yes,  now  even  swappers  are  ranked  as  high  as the
programmers  if  they  manage  to constantly "upload" several megs of wares
(not  demos,  since the swappers now are free to spread anything).  They do
not  even  have  to  be a member of a famous group (even if it helps in the
case of looking good) to be "elite".
  Still,  there  is  no  need for intelligence.  Uploading is easy and only
requires a big ass to sit on for hours and hours.
  We  all  know how people in cars behave.  Even the smallest little man or
woman  can  be  tough  and  show  people  the finger.  Why?  Easy, they are
"untouchable"  in  their car.  So are "elite modem swappers" too.  They may
bitch  and  whine  about anything, no one can come and get them through the
telephone line!
   This  is  why  almost all of the "best" uploaders are only misunderstood
kids who now have the chance to "be something".  An "elite" modemtrader can
be  incredible  tough via the boards.  He can tell everybody how good he is
or  he can get others (preferably in worse groups) how ultimate "lame" they
are.
  The  "elite  boards"  consists of special rules, almost like rites.  Some
bizarre  examples:   1)  It  is  not  good to download anything at all.  Of
course,  we  wonder how anyone can upload without downloading?  2) Those in
"better groups" does not have to work as hard with uploading as the others.
They  simple  are  Better, which reminds us about the society in India with
castes.   3)  No  one questions the fact about the ridiculous modemtrading.
Opponents are not met with the traditional "big mouth talking".  Silence is
the defense.  Why is there no answers to these behaviours?  Simply, because
there  is  no  good arguments for the business and "modemtraders" are often
not bright enough to communicate on a normal level.
  The  "elite"  modemtrader  is unique.  He is a megalomaniac who has built
enormous  castles  out of air.  He actually believes that he is "something"
in this world.  He is also very sensitive for jokes about himselves.  Which
leads us to the story about something called
 
                       THE UTOPIA PHANTASY ELITE BBS

  I  am  The  GNN and I am active in an elite-group.  I like the demo-scene
but  I despite the modem-traders.  As we know, elite-boards are interesting
ones to call in psychological research purpouses.  The lack of intelligence
and humor are outstanding and the only messages written are often so-called
BBS-ads  together  with  "Lamers!   Old  stuff!   CREDZ removed!".  The ads
always  contain  the  same  message,  preferably "ELEET, HOT WAREZ, BIG HD,
INCREDIBLE  SYSOP".   The same BBS-ad could be posted a dozens times a day,
simply  because  the  sysop BELIVES that everyone will call it then.  But I
find it only to be disturbing.  Shocking.  Boring.
  I  realised  that the only way to strike back is to create an OWN BBS-ad!
So  I did, and I terrorized the poor suckers.  The birth of the elite board
UTOPIA  PHANTASY  and its divine sysop COOLFIX was a fact.  Many (too many)
bought  the story and called desperately to the numbers I gave them.  After
a  while  they  understood  that  they  had been fooled and got real angry.
Ha!   You will not belive what some people told me to do with all these ads
and messages when I told them the truth!
  I  enjoyed  that circus, from beginning to the end.  Now you can read the
ads  that  got so many elite-d00dz crazy.  Feel free to call the numbers if
you want, but do not expect to find a HOT'N KEWL ELITE BOARD there.

  Each ad is separated by a "(---)".

  Some  *FAG* tried to HACK the UTOPA PHANTASY this morning by using a fake
account with status 255!  (everybody that calls UTOPIA PHANTASY gets status
255  but  that  is no excuse for violating my system!) However, the naughty
little  fellow  were  quite surprised when the Automatic Hacker Fucker gave
him  backfire  and sent 230 zillons of volts into his keyboard!  (Yes, Even
plastic  CAN  be  made  electrical,  if  you have ENOUGH power!).  His lame
mother  then  called be up and asked why I had burned her lovley little son
into  a  pile  of  ash.   I told her not to interfer in what happens in the
elite ELITE-SCENE!  That made her shut her face.

  My sleep is very uncommon these days.  It happens a couple of times every
night  that  the  phone rings and some incredible *LOSER* shouts in my ear.
The  message  is always the same:  "You lamer!  It was fun in the beginning
with  all  those BBS-ads and SHIT but now I begin to get tired!".  I hear a
heart-crushing  sob  and the jerk hangs up.  I laugh (It takes a big man to
cry,  but  it  takes a bigger man to laugh at that man.) but this is really
beginning  to  get  on  my  nerves!  I know why some people say things like
this,  it  is  because they CANNOT CONNECT to *UTOPIA PHANTASY*, since they
own  a  *BULLSHIT*  modem with the rates 9600, 14400, 16800 or 2400!  (Yes,
even  some  2400  lamers  tries  to  call  too,  with  a  belief that their
*WELL-KNOWN*  handle  will  get them EVERYWHERE!  Ha!  Fuck you!  I (and no
one  else)  do  not  care if you have won the UPLOADING COMPETITON at Total
Suckers BBS!).  Buy yourself a *REAL* modem instead of bothering me!  Thank
you.

(you  HAVE a 57.6 modem haven't you?!) connects.  DO NOT write "n q" at the
first  prompt (after the text about AmiExpress version 60.1 - beta version)
since  that  will  get  you  out  of  the  bbs quicker than a rabbit on the
freeway!   If  you  cannot  enjoy  my *MASTERPIECES* of ansi art, then call
another board!  *SNORT!*
  After you have CAREFULLY read through the information about me not taking
*ANY*  responsibility for the PIRATE software available here, complete with
a full copy of what the constitution, the police and the software companies
has  to  say about the legal matters - write "ok" at the prompt.  No, IT IS
NOT  possible  to use ctrl-c and stop the vital information!  I do not want
*ANYONE*  to  misunderstand  or  twist  the  fact about my clean conscience
concerning  pirated  stuff!   That  is  why each screen of the text stays 1
minute  on  your  monitor.   Have patience, the whole information show only
takes about 15 minutes to scan thru.
  Type  your  HANDLE  and  GROUP  at  the next prompt that says "write your
handle  and group".  Some people do not get it anyway and writes their real
names or some other crap.  Ha.  Write your password.  If you have forgotten
your  password,  you  can  login  under my name (COOLFIX, passw SECRET) and
check  what  you  had.   Do not look at other peoples passwords.  *PLEASE*.
Remember, we are just a big *HAPPY* family at this bbs.  A family that does
not have to find each others underwear in our tea.
  Now  you just have to go through the various bulletins that I have placed
in the login.  It won't take long, it is just All-Time Top Upload, Week-Top
Upload,  Top-login,  Top-Logout,  Top  Callers, Top Non-Callers, Top Upload
between 5 pm and 4 pm on Sundays, Top Message Posters, Top Message Readers,
Top  Lamers, Top Who's Who?, Top BeerCan Collections, Top Phone-Booth Users
and Top Top-lists in Sweden.
  Now,  about  two hours later, you are in the BBS system!  So, simply type
"J 65" to join area 65!  It cannot *BE* easier!

  This  is  unfortunately  true...   I  got  a  phonecall  to  my work this
afternoon  from  my neighbour who wondered why there was a dozen of heavily
armed tanks outside my house.  At first I thought it was a joke but when he
claimed  that a tall guy dressed in the latest body-armour fashion screamed
"Coolfix,  you  have  ten  seconds  to leave the house" every fift minute I
understood  that  it  was about *UTOPIA PHANTASY* the little intermezzo was
all about.
  I  got  in my car and drove the five-hundred metres to my house and found
the  scene  to  be  exactly  as I had believed it was.  A couple of hundred
soldiers were hiding themselves behind the tanks in front of my house while
someone  screamed that I should come out quickly, otherwize they would open
my  front  door with a missile.  I would not let that happen, it might have
destroyed my collection of rare joysticks.
  So,  I  raised  my  voice and got their attention of my present location,
behind them.  After a few 7.62 shots had been fired against me from nervous
*JERKS* I was brutaly thrown into a vehicle made out of steel and driven to
the  central  police  station in a speed that made the sun go slower on the
sky.   The  interrogation  (complete with electrical shockers and alligator
clips)  took  about  thirty  hours during which I only told them that I was
innocent.   The  BBS  had  jumped  into  my room and connected itself to my
NINETEEN NODE RINGDOWN system.  They also wondered who had been responsible
for  KARDING more computer hardware than is produced in the whole world and
I simply told them:  "No idea!  I have not the slightest clue why all these
packages  with advanced computer hardware was sent to me.  I thought it was
christmass  gifts  from  USRobotics.   I know that my bank account includes
more money than usual ($95000000 to be exact) but you *just have to believe
me*  on  this!   The reason why I own five different VISA-cards with status
'U.S.President'  is because I am a collector of VISA and MC material.  Like
Coke-bottles, you know."
  They  bought  the  story  but  confiscated  the  hardware.   All of my 98
exabytes  harddrives,  my 0679 turbo-card and the A5000++.  Which leaves us
with  the  sad  fact  that  EVEN LEGENDS HAVE TO DIE!  *UTOPIA PHANTASY* is
closed forever.
