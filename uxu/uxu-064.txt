          THE FEIGNED NON-POISONOUS GENTLEMANLIKE HERESY GAME SHOW

                               CHAPTER FOUR


     At this time,  he noticed the  weird alien  following him through
     the maze. Trillian told him not to worry. 'It's just one of those
     nice and friendly ones' she said. Zaphod seemed to take the whole
     trip to Bezelbub Interstellar Junction lightly as he continued to
     sleep,  snoring heavily.  Ford held his towel a bit tighter as he
     slipped down a three-inch Babelfish down his throat for lunch.


                                    -*-


     What? This ISN'T 'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy Part IV' ?
     Oh,  sorry about that.  I'll  make it up  to  you by  writing yet
     another inspiring full-framed vicious chapter right here.


     Megan woke up,  quite dizzy.  She  thought it  had to do with the
     night before,  but  it didn't.  Spingleman had slipped her one of
     his new inventions;  The  'Get Drunk,  and Stay Drunk the morning
     after' (GDSD) pill, but she didn't know anything about it. 'Water
     ..water' she managed to whisper,  and Spingleman made a sign to a
     man  standing in  the far corner of the room.  He went out of the
     room.


                                    -*-


     WHAT?! What are you complaining about?.. Say that again? It isn't
     'The BIG System 3' either? Then WHAT IS IT?! 'Castle Chronicles'?
     Right! I'm a bit out of touch today y'see.. Hit it!



     "Ouch!"

     Castle woke up. Instantly feeling he didn't like it.  A big table
     covered his body and when he lifted the sink that had smashed his
     head into  pieces  he noticed the  small dog chewing  on his left
     shoe  (which was, amazingly enough, still there).  'Boy, are they
     serious with this gang war stuff or what?' he thought as he tried
     to move his thumb. It hurt.

     The Mercedes just stood there.  Burning.  A couple of police-cars
     drove  by in a  frenzy and  the air was filled with..  with.. Hmm,
     Castle couldn't make  out what it was.  He had  smelled it before,
     but couldn't quite place it. Was it the Semi-Half Naked Woman? No,
     she had that excellent 'take me' scent.  It couldn't be Steinberg
     or Brown because they weren't there. Weren't there?

     "Hey!  Hello!  Miss?"  Castle tried to reach the  Semi-Half Naked
     Woman, but failed instantly trying to move his little finger.

     "Well, if it isn't Mr Rock-N-Roll De-Tec-Tive." Someone said to
     the left.

     "No, it isn't stupid" Another voice said to the right. "It's just
     that dumb Steve Castle. Mr No-Bra-In De-Tec-Tive. Heheheheheh.."

     That was enough! Castle could take much, but abuse? NO WAY!

     With a crumble he was on his feet.  Facing two  amazingly large..
     gentlemen  on motorcycles.  He  KNEW he  wasn't in a  position to
     complain or make them take back what they'd said when one of them
     reached inside his overcoat and pulled out..

     "Wanna take part in a most excellent game show, dude?" One of them
     said offering Castle the envelope he had pulled out of his pocket.

     "It isn't STUDS or anything, but it sure is fun."

     Castle hesitated. Then he reached for the envelope and opened it.

     'SHNW  &  D  Gameshows Inc.  invites you to join a most excellent
      show where you'll  be  able to win  PRICES!  Yes, we offer you a
      Complete  TV-Set,  bedroom furniture,  aaand a trip to wonderful
      Siberia, tell him more about it Jim! Ok, Mike.  We'll fly you to
      to the most luxurious place on earth with BLAH Air. You'll spend
      a weekend ...'

     He skipped that section and found  a small note at the end of the
     paper that said: 'Rules: Participants must be detectives or Semi-
     Half Naked Women'. Hmm.. how strange, he thought, but that didn't
     matter.  He'd never participated in a game show,  and this was his
     chance to get some of those nifty bathroom carpets.

     "Okay I'll do it." he said, and the two large men looked at each-
     other and smiled.

     "But I have to bring my..friend here.." he continued bending over
     to reach the Semi-Half Naked Woman.

     "Sure, that's exactly what we want you to, too." the gentleman to
     the right said. "Just hop up here, and we'll take both of you
     to the studio right away."

     As they drove away, someone lurking beneath the street whispered..

     "Hello Hellooo..  he's going to pay!  With his balls!"  He Turned
     and  headed  straight  for the  tunnel that  lead to the SHNW & D
     Studios up Johnson Avenue. "He will pay dearly.."


                                    -*-


     Mike Whitesmile,  the  game show  host found himself doing what he
     enjoyed most. Hosting a game show.

     "Rrrright, ladies and gentlemen. We're back, and what's that? Yes,
     we  have two  new contestants for you.  One found beneath a large
     table  on  Johnson Avenue and the other just next to him.  Please
     let's go and meet these two, come on.." <clap clap clap..>

     "You're the detective,  right?"  Mike said to the Semi-Half Naked
     Woman. "Hahah, sorry that was a joke."

     <pre-recorded public: aaaah>

     "No,  seriously,  let me guess here..  you must be the  Semi-Half
     Naked  (and veeerrry sexy too)  Woman if I'm not  completely from
     another planet!

     <public: ha ha ha, clap clap, whistle whistle whistle>

     Ok Ok... fankyou fankyou,  that's enough jokes for now! Then this
     one here.." he said pointing at Castle, "must be the De-Tec-Tive.
     Would you like to say something about yourselves? Castle?"

     "No FANKS", Castle answered him with a smirk on his face.

     "Well, if it isn't a humorous de-tec-tive.." Mike said to the non-
     existent studio public. <public: hah hah hah, clap clap>. "How
     about you then?", he asked the Semi-Half Naked Woman.

     "Like Ok.  When I was about three years old,  right,  my mom took
     me to this place,  y'know, called, ok, like, the Supermarket, and
     like, wow, they had so many, like different chewing-gums, y'know,
     and right by the chewing-gum shelf,  thirteen years later, I met,
     like,  a big hunk who grabbed my, as you can see, big breasts and
     just took  me  from  behind before we,  y'see,  went to this shoe
     store, and.."

     "Heheh.. well, I hear YOU have a lot to talk about," Mike said
     to the public.  <public: ha hah haaaa>  "But let's go on with the
     show! Right after these messages.. Staaaay Rrrright There!"

     <Now, Your clothes can be THIS clean too...>

     <New NKOTB Watch, Cup, T-Shirt, Bathroom-spray, Instant coffee,
      sweat-spray, pen-holder, non-slippable-banana-peel, genuine
      metal copies of their teeth. All-In-One available now...> etc.

     Castle looked at the Semi-Half Naked Woman.
     Mike looked at himself in the mirror.

     "Did you say 'Shoe Store'??" Castle asked her.

     "Why, sure. Like, I think so anyway.."

     "DO YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST...."

     "AAaaand,  We're Back!"  <public: clap clap clap,  whistle>. "I'm
     Mike (like you didn't know that! Hah hah)"  <public: Who's Mike?>
     "and, we're here with our two new contestants.  They are going to
     meet our last  week's  champions...  Frank Fontana  and  Isabella
     Rosselini!"

     <public: clap clap clap clap cla..>

     "Fooled ya! hah hah hah" <public: aaahh> "No, seriously folks, we
     have here,  the piece of meat,  the king stud of studs, the word-
     mongler  of  crosswords,  the  king-o of  lingo,  the crackpot of
     jackpot.. and  the  hunk that made it  with  this Semi-Half Naked
     Woman at the Chewing-gum shelf seven years ago..."

     <drumroll>

     "Yes,  None other than The....  Mysterious man who disappeared in
     the SHOE STORE!!"
