                            THE ETERNAL MACHINE
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


              A thought about the modern 'democratic' school.



  Creation, is a world without limits.  Enemies, where ever I look.

  Where  can you find such an incredible amount of enemies towards the free
thinking like in school?  Name another place that works so hard to kill the
force of creation, a place that slowly kills your individual thoughts.
  Hard?   No,  it  is  not  hard, it is  impossible.  Not even the cruelest
dictatorship  can  be  compared to the oppression in school.  But it exists
without  any  physical  violence  and there is no real majority against the
oppression.
  The life force of this oppression comes from the old generation and their
demands for adjustment and homogeneity.  In an eternal machine, generations
are  crushed and re-programmed so they will fit into the society.  When the
process is finished, the next generation will be attacked by the former who
now are perfect brain-washed citizens.

  Perpetuum mobile, the eternal machine, ticks.  Tick, tick, tick...

  Writing,  creation  by  pencil  and  paper,  seems  to  be one of the few
activities  in  the  pedagogical  straitjacket that is free and without any
demands, except for a perfect language.  But this is an illusion.  Even the
freedom  of  writing  is controlled.  Nothing is supposed to be left to the
free individual.  Instead, a simulated process is activated, a process that
even gives the less talented a feeling of knowledge.
  After  the  essay is finished, it will be judged by someone who have gone
through  the  process  of killing.  Someone who have learned the rules will
read the essay and tell the writer what is wrong with it.  The contents and
messages  in  the  essay  are  completely  worthless,  only  the mechanical
technique  counts.   As  long as the essay fits into the Frame it is a good
one, no matter if the contents are only pseudo-intellectual bullshit.

  Do not make any wrong moves, use a ruler instead.

  Those  who  are not accepted will soon understand that they cannot write,
and  correct  themselves  to  a  situation  where  they  only  write to fit
perfectly into the Frame.  Conformism occurs and no one asks why.
  What are they afraid for?  Why  can  we  live  out  our force of creation
almost  everywhere  except  in  school?  Because  it is  the school's duty.
Society needs bricks that can be  placed  into  the  state and work without
any complaints.  Therefor,  school  has  to  destroy  every  piece  of free
thinking before the bricks walks out into society. If school is not enough,
there are other ways to crush people.  Media, religions, law and so on...

  School  is  a  fascist  institute.   A  mild  one,  that  no one dares to
question.  If you question school, you will be exterminated.  Many teachers
are megalomaniacs.  They speak the truth.  Their own personal truth.

  If  you look at a mirror, you cannot see what is behind it.  You can only
look  backwards.  But when you see yourself, you realize that you have been
fooled.  Fooled by who?

  We are afraid to do mistakes, but we rather die than letting other people
know  of  them.  For ages, the old generation have placed their children in
front of mirrors.  Look behind!  Do not see our mistakes, because if you do
that - you have ruined our life!  Before you are strong enough to take down
your  mirror,  you must learn that whatever you will find behind it will be
the Right Thing!  No alternatives.
  Once  again  shall  the  mistakes be repeated.  The generations will pick
them up and name them as the Right Thing to do.

  The eternal machine ticks.  Over and over again.
