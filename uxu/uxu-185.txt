  There are a number of textfiles about how to make bombs, but very few
about how to protect yourself from them. I guess this may be the first.
Those textfiles are of course just for informational purposes but some
people just don't get it I guess... I might give a statement about this
textfile as well. This textfile is NOT for informational purposes only,
this may save your life.
  The number of letter-bombs have increased lately, a while ago a swedish
anti-racist activist received a video tape which turned out to contain a
lethal bomb which would have exploded if he had tried to play the tape. In
Denmark, Germany and in the USA people have been killed by letter-bombs.
So if you think someone is after you, you have every reason to be careful.
  A few years ago you could safely assume that a letter weighing below 100
grammes would not contain a bomb big enough to kill. But with electronics
and batteries getting smaller and with more powerful explosives this has
changed. A lethal letter can now weigh far less that 100 grammes!
  You may receive several false bombs, just to irritate and scare you as
well as putting you off your guard when the real bomb shows up.

Here are some good advice to follow:  

* Watch out for unexpected letters but be especially careful when you
receive a letter or parcel from someone you think you know. It is not
unusual for bombers to use the address of a known organization or
individual and there have been cases where envelopes containing
letter-bombs have looked like a genuine mailing from an organization or
company.
* If you are uncertain about a letter that looks genuine, call the sender
and find out before you open the letter. Better safe than sorry... If you
receive a letter that is suspicious, don't hesitate to call the police.
The police will not complain about being called out if it turns out to be
a false alarm.
* Most important, do *not* mess with something you think is a bomb. You
don't know how to disarm it - very few people do - and if you start
messing with it, you are likely to end up in a hospital, or worse.
Police bomb squads have trained personnel and the necessary equipment to
deal with a bomb, and even they do not try to tamper with it or try to
disarm it. The usual procedure is to let it go off, safely.
* The same procedure applies to small "firecracker" bombs. A small bomb
may not kill you but it can do a lot of damage including severe burns,
loss of eyesight or forced amputation of a hand or arm.
* If you absolutely feel that you have to open the parcel or letter, try to
open it carefully and look for any signs that may hint that it is a bomb,
like electric wires, batteries and so on. If you find anything like that,
leave it and call the police. Always open it from the other side than usual,
then it may not go off. This saved Hagge Geigert, a swedish media
personality.

That was the most important things I had to say, and remember the golden
rule: Better safe than sorry. And let's be careful out there!
