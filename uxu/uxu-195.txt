/*The City*/




  The city was alive during daytime.


  The  city  was  big  and grey, it had a large population and a cold look.
The large apartment blocks looked down quietly at their inhabitants, who at
this  very  moment  were on their way to work.  These people showed a great
resemblance  to  ants  when they in one big mass  crept towards  the closed
corridors  of  boredom.  Their struggle to make enough money for rent, food
and clothing had just begun.


  This  very  moment,  during  daytime,  the  city ruled over the citizens,
because it was their only way to earn money.  You didn't oppose against the
city's rules, or question its conditions for living.  If you did, something
bad was bound to happen to you.


  The inhabitants of the apartment blocks had just found their way into the
city center by all kinds of transportation.  Inside, the concrete spoke its
clear  language:   No  nonsense, please!  The whole city's appearance urged
you to take the fastest lane, not to argue and to do what you were supposed
to.  Nothing more and nothing less.  The streets were straight, the corners
pointy  and the edges sharp.  There was simply not enough time for anything
fancy.  Efficiency was and stayed most important.


  The  inhabitants  continued  towards  their  work,  while  all  the  city
buildings stared down on them, almost like they were giving a silent order.
The humans did not complain because even though they knew that they totally
depended on the city, they also knew that the city depended on them just as
much.   Without  the  humans,  the  walls  would  soon  be cracking up, the
concrete  start  to  fall  apart  and the windows fall out of their frames.
Therefore  the  city  made sure to not give any reasons for complaints.  It
held  its  demands  at a proper level, so that the machinery could continue
ticking  without  interference.   Of course, some poor humans couldn't even
cope  with  these  easy demands, and they were without mercy passed down to
the  city slum, were they quickly got forgotten, or conveniently died.  The
city had no sympathy for the weak.


  The  day  moved  on  however,  and  the  citizens  worked hard with their
individual  tasks, all the time in a sort of symbiosis with the city.  When
the  work  was  done  the  humans  went  towards  their respective means of
transportation  and  started the journey home.  The night had just begun to
fall,  and  with  it  the  city's  second appearance started to form.  Warm
yellow  light  began to light up the square windows of the apartment blocks
and the evening darkness had started to smooth out the sharp silhouettes of
the city center and suburbs.


  The  citizens  were now unleashed from the demands of the city.  They had
been  working  hard  during  the  day and now, in the night, they got their
reward  because  darkness  had  transformed the city.  Warm inviting lights
were shimmering from bar- and restaurant windows alongside the streets, and
not  one  sharp  angle  could  be seen.  The imagination was now allowed to
create its own shapes, and forms of the surrounding houses.


  You  could even see the difference when flying over the city.  During the
day  it  looked just like a big grey substance, glued to the earth.  In the
night  it looked like a gigantic piece of golden electronic circuitry, with
its  components  glittering.  The electronic paths were represented by lamp
posts alongside roads which curved in and out among the houses.


  The city had become beautiful, unspeakably beautiful.


  The  citizens  roamed  around enjoying themselves while the city watched,
slumbering.   This  went  on to about 3 am and at that time the streets lay
empty  and  silent.   All humans had gone back to their concrete coffins to
sleep.


  When  the first morning light hit the city's sharp concrete monuments, it
was  sound asleep.  But it would soon wake up and the machinery would start
tick, tick, ticking again.
