                                            - Rage Against The Machine


    People. No, women, men, the other sex. Whatever. With large egos.
    Some have had their call with them. Some will meet them. Anyway,
    you need to keep your shit-ass hat on when you're dealing with
    them. Fuck. You know, that girl. (Hey, substitute 'girl' for boy
    if you're one. This goes for everyone). You know you need something
    from her. It may be just friendship, it may be more than that,
    but believe me, it is a lost cause from the start. Well, you don't
    believe that from the start, of course. Or _they_ have failed. They
    need to throw that web of innocence, non-egotistical, friendly and
    oh-ever-so-kind front up your ass to get you to become interested
    in the first place. When they notice that you indeed did swallow
    the bait, they will continue to be sweet, innocent, even caring
    (if they are able to be that) sometimes. For a while. JUST DON'T
    BE FOOLED! Please. P L E A S E, if you're sincere, if your feelings
    are genuine, keep the distance, you had before, from the start.
    (Of course this only applies when you've noticed that she _is_ in
    fact just a large ego walking the streets.)

    How? Just don't meet her, call her, talk to her for two days, and
    meet other people during those two days, and *think* about if you
    really want her to be yours/your friend/whatever. Can you stand
    hearing her talking about herself day in and day out, when you're
    with her, when you sleep, when... If she gets pregnant, do you want
    to be the father, and hers for the rest of your life? Do you care
    about her enough to make that commitment? Of course. When you _think_
    you like, even love, someone, you can make those commitments, and
    fool yourself to death. What you need is "A Bullet In Your Head"
    - courtesy of rage against the machine yet again. Seriously, watch
    your ordinary day and see if she fits in. Can you give her something
    she doesn't already have by becoming her boyfriend/friend/aaaaaagh?

    Sex? Sure.
    Listen, she's getting all the sex she wants from others, so that is
    at the very lowest step of the ladder. No, cross that one out. THINK!
    How does your everyday look? Would it change if you became her
    whatever? Why? Ask yourself these questions. More than once. Get
    drunk. Get stoned. Get your ass out the door and ask yourself.
    Now if you think I wanted you to say "Yes, it would change" to get
    out of this stupid situation you're _wrong_. If it would change
    then she's got the hook in you. Yes yes, you're hooked. There's
    only one thing you can do if you're hooked and really want to be
    hooked on this person. Let it go. Unless you're able to share her
    with about 20 ex-boyfriends and 200% of her talking about herself,
    you're lost. She will dump you like the fool you are in a couple of
    weeks. It's just a matter of time before she loses interest in you.
    It's just a game to her. She proves that she can get _anyone_ by
    not doing anything. You just proved her point.

    Now, I hear you say - "well, what if she's not _really_ like that?"
    "she's an ego, okay, but she's kind to me." _Big_, no - _Huge smile_.
    Yeah, so I also thought that once, or twice. (Some people don't
    understand the first time - like myself.) Believe me, she is like that.
    She'll be kind to you as long as you only show an interest. But as
    soon as you open up to her (ie. whatever you say, "I want you.." etc.),
    she wins. Then she can use everything you said to your disadvantage,
    she's got you where she wants you to be. And she won't listen to reason.
    Now you can't tell her "Hey, why are you talking about yourself all the
    time? You're such an ego." because you don't want to lose her and make
    her _use_ the stuff you said. But listen. Why do you want to keep her?
    Keep her, by the way? Do you _have_ her? No. She's got _you_.  You'll
    never ever _have_ her. No-one will. That's the deal. To spare yourself
    from nerves on the edge, to save you from getting really _hurt_, to
    keep your dignity (if you have any that is), keep the fucking distance.

    Of course, there are things you can do if you want to keep her as a
    friend. Maybe you want that huh? There might be ways to change her
    ego into something not-so-egotistical, right? (yeah.. right. santa
    is real too huh?) Seriously, of course you _may_ be able to change
    her ways. If so, you're lucky, but you're also in for some heavy duty
    work. They way I do it (can't speak for anyone else) - I keep the
    distance.

    I remark lightly when she talks about herself, give her small hints
    like changing the subject every time she starts on her ego-trips. Any
    subject is good enough. Even the weather. And I don't call her. No no.
    That's probably the most effective thing to do. She expects you to call
    her. _You're_ the one that's interested in _her_, right?  So you're
    the one who should call her. So, just don't do it. Easy enough. She'll
    wonder after a couple of days (usually two days is enough for her ego
    to start wondering what she did wrong this time) - then she'll call
    you. "I WON!" you think. W R O N G. You're on your way to success
    though. But it is a small step. Tiny tiny step. You're playing with
    her ego, remember that. You can still end up on either side of the
    border. Friend. Enemy. She's still in control, but she allowed herself
    to show you something by calling you of which you now have control over.

    She'll never ask you why you didn't call her. That would _really_ be
    fatal to her ego. That would show she waited for you to call. (You're
    still the one who's interested in her, and that's the way she wants
    it to be.) On the other hand, if she asks you, then her ego isn't that
    large, and you can play it your way from here on. You're lucky.
    Well, suppose she didn't ask. What do you do then? Real easy. Keep
    doing it! Don't call her. Make her call you a couple of times (two
    or three times is enough, the more the better though.) When you
    notice (and you'll notice) she loses interest (and she will), do
    something about it. Let her "win". One time. Yes, call her once (or
    meet her, or something, whatever). But only once! Then go back and
    play it safe. Just don't repeat this again, because then she'll
    think she figured you out. Do something different, just don't let
    her "win". Not yet. Don't call her. She'll call you. Go out with
    someone, do stuff with other people, live your normal social life,
    but without her, for a while, and tell her about it (if you're home
    when she calls -hint hint-) Play it out for a while, and _don't_
    let her win when you notice she's starting to lose interest. Not
    this time.

    We're well on our way to success now, and you don't want to fail,
    do you? No, of course not. By this time, she's not sure of you
    at all, and her ego has received a blow, small, but still a blow.
    If she still calls you, she probably want to keep you as a
    friend. So be her friend. Just _never ever_ let her win more
    than once in a while if she continues to show you her large ego.
    What I mean is, keep the distance. Even though you're friends,
    don't let her think she's got control over you - then you have
    to work twice as hard the next time (and probably lose her too).

    This is only a game we play. People do this shit all over the
    world. It's going on right now. And it _is_ only a game. She
    probably doesn't want to be your friend after all of this, but
    who cares, right? It's just life. There's a lot more to it than
    wasting time on egos. What it all comes down to, though, is;

    Friends shouldn't take advantage over each other, right? Good
    friends share. Good friends can talk about everything. Good friends
    have fun. You should be able to criticize a friend without a risk
    of losing him/her. When you think you're able to do that with
    someone, you're friends. Good friends are hard to find.

            sometimes... it's wiser to settle for nothing

                             remember that.

                  Play your game well, and you'll win.
