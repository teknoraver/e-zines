 OC000.VOC = Very strange recording
           
             
 OC001.VOC = This was stolen from a VMB at a circus, a guy calls them up and
             claims that he has a six legged cow. Give this guy a call he is
             mentaly phuckt. I called him up myself and asked him about
             the six legged cow and he was happy about me calling uhh.
             I didn't record when i called him up cuz i really didn't think
             he was like that for real but he was, so give him a call.
           
 
 OC002.VOC = When i first dialed this number it was silent for 1 minute,
             it still is, i just got bored and waited and i got this message.
             Strange as phuck, so pheel phree to call the guy.
