   SCREWING OVER FIDONET BBS'S THROUGH THE INTERNET - 2 parts


 A NOTE FROM THE HEAD Jesus
 --------------------------
I wish I could think of somthing interesting to say. Maybe next issue.
However; this issue does have a few interesting ideas for all you evil
types out there. So read on and let us know what you think. For info on
contacting us, read the end of the file. If you have any ideas or views
that need expressing, please let us know, we will be glad to accomadate
you and will add any ideas you may have in future issues.


 ANOTHER NOTE FROM Jesus
 -----------------------
I just got the beavis and butthead comic.  (1st issue) It sucked! But
perhaps it will be worth somthing someday. Very very weak though...
It's out now or at the release of this file anyway so if you want it,
go to your local comic shop and get it. May be worth some serious cash
in a few years.


 Screwing over your most hated sysop through Fidonet and the Internet.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 By Jesus

   Is there a local fidnet type sysop that has pissed you off? A sysop 
that has overstepped his bounds and deserves death? Well don't kill him. 
I have before you a few ideas that may help you get the revenge and respect 
that you deserve. Remember, these are only ideas and I don't indulge in 
these nasty acts myself, I just report them to any intersted readers for 
info and entertainment purposes only. So read on,  and if you don't think 
I can write worth a shit then I truly appoligize and beg for your forgivness. 
However; I am not a professional writer, just a fellow with a few ideas to 
trade.

   All you need to do this is an Internet account. It would be best to be
using one that doesn't belong to you. If you don't know how to crack accounts
then e-mail me and if enough interest is generated I will do a file on password
cracking. (but its really simple and you should already know how to do it)
   The basic idea here is to use the fidonet gateway on the internet to bombard
your target with mail. Most sysops have to call long distance to get their fido
mail. Even if the sysop doesn't have to call long distance, someone else is
doing it for them. So if you e-mail your victim about 5 - ?? megs of e-mail a
day, it will become too expensive for them to continue to stay on the net which
will make their board even lamer than it already is and cause the board traffic
to drop. Or if you wanted to, you could just e-mail him like 100's of little
short messages so it would become a serious chore for him to sort through his
mail everyday and really piss him off.

 Here is how to send fido mail through the inet.

 |                                              |
 ===============================================|


 If the board has an actual internet address... (Goodie)
 ==============================================

   It seems to be the big sysop trend now days to get your board an internet
address. Since the internet is one of the most anonymous places in the world,
you can really do some damage here.
   Some sysops are using a satelite to get their mail. The satelite is really
not that great because you can only transfer about 20 megs in a 24 hour period.
But this works to your advantage. :) Why? Well it's easy! If you mail the
loaathed sysop 20 - 40 megs a day of just plain trash (i.e. text files, uue
stuff, x-rated text files, and other stuff they wouldn't want to be assosiated
with.) they would never get there own mail and usenet. ( Usenet is a public
message base that bbs's like to carry). They would be using all their time
transferring the crap you are sending them. Even if there own mail does come
through (and eventually it would) they would not be able to sort through it.
It's great, chances are they will just say 'The Hell with It' and drop the
internet. There is absolutly nothing they can do.

You can use these ideas I have just given you to generate some of your own. The
Internet mail system does provide the terriost :) with a good system of flaming
disliked god-type-sysops. If you come up with some better ideas then let me 
know.

Every town has Sysops that think they are Gods gift to bbs'ers. Most of them
are serious dicks and they stand for the oppisite of what bbsing is all about.
These people should be put in their place!!! Thank you for reading this file.
Later Days . . .
