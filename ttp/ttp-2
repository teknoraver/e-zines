Hello, Pompus Pilot here! This file is the first in my series of Internet
tricks. This file will teach you how to Funky Email someone. In other words,
send email to somebody and have it look as if it came from somebody else.
It's a very easy thing to do. 

Step 1 - Telnet to a site on the internet, any site that has a mail server 
installed. (99.9 percent of sites do) Telnet at port 25 though, this is the 
mail port. The command line will look like this

telnet anywhere.internet.edu 25

after you connect type

helo

then type

mail from: The_person_you_imitate@Thier_machine

the machine is optional. but if its not local mail then it must be there.

then type

rcpt to: The_victum@victums.machine

as above, machine is optional if its local mail.

then type

data

type your message

then at the end, press . on a line by its self followed by an <ENTER>

and the message is sent.

Its good to telnet to the site you want the mail to appear to have come from.
This way the return path will be correct. You don't have to have the sender be
from a real machine. I have seen email from god@heaven.com (not a real machine)
But for the most fun, email that looks like its from root@youmachine is always
good, just remember, if its supposed to be local mail just have it make the
sender be the login name only, no machine name. Other good ones are
agent_murphy@fbi.gov, or root@fbi.gov, bill clintons email address, or
billy idols. If its a real address, the person repelys then it will go to that
addresss and start a whole shit storm with one message, Cool huh? Also this
works on gateways to other networks, so if someone is on a pay service that
charges for reciveing email then find out that places gateway and make a script
that repeatly sends large email pacs to the victum and run up thier bill.
You would be supprised how much email a simple shell script can pump out
in 5 or 6 hours. and if you nohup and '&' it you can log off and let it run
indefinatly.

Later Days and Happy Funky E-mailing
