* Revision 1.20  1993/02/23  00:16:38  schemers

fixed syntax error (should have compiled before checking in...)

* Revision 1.19  1993/02/23  00:15:15  schemers

turned off printing of "is alive" when -a is specified.

* Revision 1.18  1992/07/28  15:16:44  schemers

added a fflush(stdout) call before the summary is sent to stderr, so
everything shows up in the right order.

* Revision 1.17  1992/07/23  03:29:42  schemers
* Revision 1.16  1992/07/22  19:24:37  schemers

Fixed declaration of timeval_diff. Didn't notice the problem because
I use 'cc' in stead of gcc under Ultrix. Time to switch? :-)

Modified file reaing so it would skip blank lines or lines starting
with a '#'. Now you can do something like:

fping -ad < /etc/hosts

* Revision 1.15  1992/07/21  17:07:18  schemers

Put in sanity checks so only root can specify "dangerous" options.
Changed usage to show switchs in alphabetical order.
* Revision 1.14  1992/07/21  16:40:52  schemers
* Revision 1.13  1992/07/17  21:02:17  schemers

Changed the default timeout to 2500 msec, and retry to 3. This was
due to suggestions from people with slow (WAN) networks. The default
1 sec timeout was too fast.


Added '-e' option for showing elapsed (round-trip) times on pakets, and
modified the -s option to include min, max, and average round-trip times,
and over all elapsed time.

Modified action taken when a error is returned from sendto. The action
taken now considers the host unreachable and prints the hostname 
followed by the errno message. The program will not exit and will continue
to try other hosts.

* Revision 1.12  1992/07/17  16:38:54  schemers
* Revision 1.11  1992/07/17  16:28:38  schemers

 move socket create call so I could do a setuid(getuid()) before the
 fopen call is made. Once the socket is created root privs aren't needed
 to send stuff out on it.

 moved num_timeout counter. It really was for debug purposes and didn't
 make sense to the general public :-) Now it is the number of timeouts
 (pings that didn't get received with the time limit).


* Revision 1.10 1992/07/16  16:24:38  schemers
* Revision 1.9  1992/07/16  16:00:04  schemers
* Revision 1.8  1992/07/16  05:44:41  schemers

Added _NO_PROTO stuff for older compilers, and _POSIX_SOURCE
for unistd.h, and _POSIX_SOURCE for stdlib.h. Also added
check for __cplusplus.

Now compiles ok under Ultrix 3.1, and Sun4 using cc. Also compiled
ok using g++ 2.2.2.

Changed '-a' and '-u' flags to be mutually exclusive (makes sense, since
specifiying both '-a' and '-u' is the same as not specifiying anything.
Since '-a' and '-u' are mutually exclusive, these options now only print
the hostname, and not the 'is alive' or 'is unreachable'  messages.
This makes it much easier to do stuff like:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$hosts_to_backup=`cat /etc/hosts.backup|fping -a`;

Since you don't have to strip off the 'is alive' messages.

Changed usage to and stats to print to stderr instead of stdout.
