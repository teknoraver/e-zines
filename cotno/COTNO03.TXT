Welcome to Issue #3 of CoTNO!  

For those of you reading CoTNO for the first time let explain the purpose of 
the magazine.  We will only print articles which are of general interest to 
the H/P community.  Those articles will be oriented at the beginner to average 
hacker and we will keep the total length of the 'zine short enough so it 
doesn't become a chore to read.  We accept submissions from anyone who has the 
will to spread around a little of thier expertise.  In fact, we have made it 
easier than ever to submit.  We have established an Internet mailing address 
where you can send your proposals or you comments concerning CoTNO.  The 
address is:

                   ak687@freenet.hsc.colorado.edu

Of course if you can get on the TNO HQ BBS, Flatline, you can leave us mail
there.  Occasionally you may even be able to catch one of us on IRC or on a
bridge or in a Telco dumpster and you can chat with us live.  We look forward 
from hearing from you.

Ahem...


[The following article appeared in the Dec. 28th issue of the Rocky Mountain
News.  The headline was on the front cover and the story appeared on page
five.  The Rocky Mountain News is Denver's biggest newspaper.  My comments

              -----------------------------------------

            *** TEEN HACKERS ACCUSED IN TELEPHONE SCAM ***
      Police say 'amazing' computer whizzes stole customers' access 
               numbers; $50,000 in illegal calls made.

Three Colorado teen-agers are suspected of setting up an elaborate computer-
hacking system that tapped into a long-distance telephone company and stole 
secret access codes (k0dez!).

The codes (k0dez!), or Personal Identification Numbers, were sold (sold? yeah
right) or traded to others, particularly people linked to a huge computer 
underground (thats us!), said Detective Greg Bohlen of the Littleton Police
Department.

The victim, Long Distance Dialing Service of Louisiana (950-1001), estimates
nearly $50,000 in illegal calls were made by non-customers with the codes, he
said. (hey Cav, wasn't that the k0de that refused to die?)

Police arrested Kevin Wilson (Damian), 18, of the 7400 block of South Gallup
Street in Littleton, and two juveniles (Epsilon and Shockwave) from Jefferson
County in the alleged scheme.

The young hackers (they weren't hackers at all, they were pirates who didn't 
know telnet from telenet) had set up a system much like the computer in the 
movie _War Games_, Bohlen said.  They programmed their computers to dial and
redial in split-second speed, trying out different seven-digit (he means six
digits, sheesh) combinations to find active access codes (programmed my ass, 
they just set up Code Thief to hack a 950).

"In fact, the suspects called their system 'War Games,'" (t00 el33t) Bohlen
said.

"These kids are amazing (amazing???).  When it comes to computer technology,
thier knowledge and experience is amazing (WHAT?!  These guys were couriers
who spent all their time uploading and downloading console game.).  But when
it comes to everything else, they're out of touch. (I'll say)  Their world
revolved around computers." (nothing wrong with that)

Bohlen said the three were arrested in October, but the investigation was not
revealed until this week (every sysop in town knew about it within 24 hours)
when computer experts finished testing equipment seized from their homes.

Wilson and one of the juveniles are charged in a separate case involving the
theft last summer of about $8,000 worth of computer equipment from a 
Littleton business where Wilson worked, Bohlen said.  That case is pending.

Formal charges in the hacking investigation have not been filed, he said.

Wilson declined comment Monday, saying, "I don't know much about computers."
(or about hacking and phreaking)

But in a search warrant filed Oct. 21 in Arapahoe County District Court, police
said Wilson "has confessed his advanced knowledge of computers (smooth move)
and desire to obtain a prestigious reputation (I'm impressed) amoung computer 
bulletin-board operators." (He got busted just to impress a bunch of warez
kiddies?)

Long Distance Dialing Service notified Colorado authorities of the problem in
September.  U S West and MCI also participated in the investigation, court
records show.

              -----------------------------------------

OK, now I set the story straight.  Damian, Epsilon, and Shockwave are couriers
for some of the local warez boards.  They couriered console games from big 
boards in other states.  Being that couriering causes some serious phone
bills, they thought they would be elite and hack some codes.  They set up Code
Thief and let it run continously on 950-1001 until they got a code.  They
didn't divert and they didn't try and make the scan random.  Of course LDDS
noticed what was going on and traced them.  They had had some trouble with 
hackers (hehehe) this year and were looking to catch someone.  They let the
pirates make a few phone calls with thier code and traced them everytime they
used it.  Those loozers didn't even try and divert.  They just called directly
from thier houses and downloaded games for hours.  Thats real 'amazing'.

If these guys had half a brain, they would have taken some precautions with 
thier code.  First of all, they should have hacked the code from a payphone.
Secondly, they should have diverted at least twice before using the code.
ESS keeps a record of every call made so it isn't very hard for U.S. West to
trace a call.

These guys deserved to get caught.  They thought they were so elite since they
stole software that they could just steal phone service.  I hate to tell them,
but its just not that easy.  Hacking is a game with some very high stakes, and
they lost.  To be good at the game takes patience and intelligence.  You have
to be willing to take precautions.  You have to build on the knowledge of 
experienced hackers and be willing to help out those who aren't as experienced
as you are.  You have to take the time to learn from every resource available
before you go out and attack a system.  If these basic rules aren't followed,
you are destined to lose the game.  Damian will soon find out just how rough
loosing can be.  Don't make the same mistakes he did.

I have included an article written by Cavalier and Jewish Lightning on hacking
950's in this issue.  It is the best 950 article I have ever read and explains
how to hack codes without getting caught.  If you plan on getting some codes,
read this article first.  It might keep you out of jail.

     Okay, This is the first text file i've written for CoTNo so I hope
that everyone can find some use for it. First off, i'll give a list of 
equipment you'll need and then a basic and easy way to set it up.  I've 
included the Catalog Numbers so you don't have to waste anytime dealing
with the incompetent moron's at Radio Shack, - "What are the last 4 numbers
of your phone number?  Shut up, gimme my shit, and get me the fuck outta
here!"


EQUIPMENT:

             1. Telephone Recording Control .
                Made by Archer, Catalog Number 43-228A .
                No batteries required.

             2. Beige Box (I used one that has a male and a female end. 
                Fairly short in length, with the alligator clips on the 
                male end).

             3. Cheap Tape Recorder with a Mic Input and a Rem Input. 
                You can also use one that has a Mic Input and Ear Input. 
                The smaller the better. (Ex. Realistic Micro-27 Model No.
                14-1044)

 (Optional)  4. 50 foot + basic telephone wire

 (Optional)  5. A 3.5mm to 2.5mm converter. Use this if you have 2 2.5mm
                jacks on your tape recorder. This is common in most mini
                cassette recorders.



DIRECTIONS:


     1. Get your Beige Box and find the number that you need to tap. 
        Use some nifty Automatic Number Identifiers (ANI) to make 
        sure that you have the right number.
     
     2. Once you have the number, hook the beige box up to a 50' + wire
        and string it to a concealled location.

     3. Attach the Telephone Recording Control and set to Record.

     4. Insert the Control's two plugs into the recorder - the larger
        plug into the socket marked MIC, the smaller one into the
        socket marked REM. If you don't have a REM socket, try the
        EAR (earphone) socket.

     5. My girlfriend suggested wrapping the equipment in a plastic
        bag so it doesn't get wet, and who said girlfriends aren't 
        good for something!

     6. The cool thing about this device is that it starts recording 
        once the phone is picked up and stops recording once the
        phone is hung up.

     6. Check back at least once a day. You don't need anyone knowing
        that the tap is there. I'm not quite sure what Ma Bell would
        do if they found one. Any information would be greatly 
        appreciated.
     

That's about it. Fairly easy and fun to do! I could think of many 
wonderful uses for it! Unfaithful Girlfriends, Bitchy Mothers, 
Exfriends, Lawyers, Cheap Skate Drug-dealers, you name it, one can
always have fun with a phone tap!

If you have any problems with this, you can contact me on T.N.O.'s 
Headquarters, FlatLine.

Thanks and hellos going to my friends that helped me along.

KiND of an INTRo:
----------------
     Phreaking these days is getting pretty tricky. Half the text files
written don't work anymore, and the other half were bullshit in the first
place. But while phreaking is getting a little more technical, it is by no
means impossible. Some methods from the mid 80's have survived over the years
and still work today, with a few changes. One of the most timeless ways of
phreaking is the good ol' 950 extenders...


NiNE-FiVE-0Hz:
-------------
     Virtually every phreaker knows the convenience of having a
working 950 code.  They're free from payphones, the codes are easy to
remember, they can last forever, you get a crystal clear connection, and they
are one of the safest possible ways of dialing-out, and on and on and on...

     What's a 950? 950's get their name from the toll-free prefix in which
the dial-ups are found (950-xxxx). Though the dial-ups vary from region to
region, the 950 prefix is national and can be found in every US calling area.
The best in depth definition is probably from MixMaster of ABUSE in his 950
text, so quoting him:

"The 950 service offers national companies that network a system of letting
the employees access through the business TOLL-FREE from a payphone... This
lets the company issue their own toll free dial-in and with an issued
passcode the employee may dial within the system to the office and extensions
or dial to a long distance number... This is basically similar to 1-800...
The 950 services are NOT in anyway affiliated with your local phone company
and very few are affiliated with and MAJOR L/D company."

     Summing up, 950's are basically regional or national access PBX's for
major businesses with a few long distance networks here and there that offer
long distance service to subscribers who are away from home. These are called
Specialized Common Carriers. This is how it works: The customer calls his
assigned 950 dial-up.  At the tone he enters his access code and then the
number he wants to call.  The call is charged to his account (Or his
companies account).


GhETTiN K0DEz AB0De:
-------------------

This is Jewish Lightning and Cavaliers method of hacking codes:

1. Find a VIRGIN dial-up
2. Explore the dial-up
3. Hack the dial-up
4. Distribute codes


UNo - Find a VIRGIN dialup:

     If you want a good code, that will last a long time, the best
thing to do is hack it from a virgin dial-up. In order to find a virgin
dial-up, you will need to do some scanning.  All 950 dial-ups are located
between 0000 and 1999.  This makes them very easy to find. There are three
ways to scan for tones:
     1. HAND-SCANNING : Hand-scanning is not a lot of fun...in fact it is
pretty boring, and very slow too.  It may be good for scanning 800's, but now
950's, but if you do decide to do it by hand you can make you scan shorter by
noting that 950 dial-ups will not even ring before they pick up, they will
just pick up. So if you dial a 950-xxxx and it starts ringing, you know it's
not a dial-up, so you might as well hang up.
     2. WARDIALING : In order to scan for dial-ups using a regular wardialer,
you need to scan with the speaker on and listen to every dial. This is just
like hand-scanning, except your finger doesn't get tired. When you get a tone,
jot the number down. As mentioned above, if a 950-xxxx starts ringing, you
might as well abort to the next number, because there's no dial-up there.
     3. TONELOC-ING! : If your modem detects dial-tone, use toneloc and scan
for tones. Just type "toneloc 950-xxxx /m:0000-1999" and let'er rip. This is
the most efficient and effective way to scan for dial-ups. The scan with
toneloc takes about 4-5 hours.


DOHss - Explore the dial-up:

     Once the scanning is done, explore the dial-up and learn more about it.
There are two things in particular you will be looking for:
     Number One: the company who owns the dial-up
     Number Two: the format for the dial-up

     1. Find out more about the company who runs this dial-up. The purpose of
this step is to get an idea of who you are messing with and what precautions
they have taken against phreakers. A very effective and obvious way of
finding out more about a 950 is to enter numbers at the tone until you get a
response (busy, recording, operator or otherwise) or use the speed-calling
available on many dial-ups by dialing #<0-9> (Try #0 for the operator).  If
you get a recording, listen carefully, it might identify the long distance
carrier who owns the 950.  If you get an operator, he/she usually answers
with the LD company's name.  Ask him/her for the 800 customer service number. 
If they cannot give it to you for some reason or another, call up 800
directory assistance (1-800-555-1212) and ask for it.
     Now that you have got the name of the company and their toll-
free number, call the company posing to be a possible customer. 
Ask for information on their long-distance telephone services and
mention that your neighbor experienced problems with someone
abusing his code and what this company does to counter toll-fraud. 
Ask specifically about a feature that records the numbers of where
the call is coming from without sounding too smart, also ask about
all the information that they put on the bill.  If they have ANI,
note this.  If they don't know, and try to play it off like they have
some other technical security bull-shit, then write "Take me! I'm
yours" by their number.  Try this with a few different service reps
just in case someone was trying to bullshit you.
     2. Now that you have a better idea of who you're messing with, you need
to find out the format for the dial-up (ie, number of digits, code first,
etc). The most common format is CODE+ACN, though some will accept CODE+1+ACN,
in fact I have never found a dial-up that was not "code first". So you know
the format, but you don't know how many digits the code is. In order to
determine how many digits the code is, enter random digits until you get a
response and note how many numbers you entered. Subtract 10 from this for the
ACN (Area Code and Number) and you have the number of digits of the code. Do
this a few times because as mentioned before, some dial-ups will accept a "1"
before the ACN and this adds and extra digit that may not be necessary. For
this reason, among other things such as strange formats, double check your
findings.
     To illustrate this better, here's a "FOR EXAMPLE": You dial up 950-xxxx,
wait for the tone, and enter 17 digits before you get a ring and then an
"invalid code" recording. You try this again, and this time it only takes 16
digits before you get the recording. Chances are, you dialed a "1" before the
last 10 digits. You try one more time, for good measure, and sure enough, it
only takes 16 digits. Subtract 10 from that and you have a code length of 6.
     As mentioned above, some dial-ups have a bizarre format. Usually this is
just a variation of the "code first" format. Here's another "For example":
Sometimes after six digits you will get another dial tone, then you will need
to enter ten more digits (ACN+Number) and then you should get a busy,
constant ring, or a message that tells you that you have entered an invalid
code.  You can assume the code is a six-digit code plus area code plus
number. This is not restricted to 6-digit codes though. Some with this format
will be 8-digits, some with 7, etc. You just need to play with it until you
can figure it out.
     Once you *think* you've got the format and the number of digits in the
code, hang up and try the new format to see if you got it correct: 950-xxxx,
X-DIGIT-CODE + AREA-CODE + NUMBER.


TREz - Hack the dial-up:

     Wow!  Now you have the 950 dial-up, information about the
security, and the format for their codes. Time to hack. There are three ways
you can do this:

     1. Hack from a payphone
     2. Hack using a code-hacking program such as Code Thief
     3. Hack though a diverter from home

     1. Hacking codes from a payphone is by far the SAFEST way to go. The
payphone is the best diverter. The method entails going to a payphone with a
dial-up in mind, and entering random X-digit numbers plus ACN where X equals
the number of digits in the code. This gets pretty hectic thinking up random
numbers, and then remembering what you dialed should you enter a valid code.
So to make things easier and more efficient, write a program that generates
random X digit numbers. You can even do this in BASIC (yes *BASIC*) with the
following:

10 FOR K=1 TO X                      <- X=number of random numbers to print
20 RANDOMIZE TIMER                                          <- if necessary
30 LPRINT INT(RND(0)*89999)+10000             <- LPRINT with print this out
                         ^- both numbers have as many digits as in the code
                             ie, if 6-digit code then "899999" and "100000"
40 NEXT K
50 that's it unless you want to put END here.

     Print a page or two out of these random numbers. Now head on down to
your local 7-11 payphones and hack away. It's a good idea to use a phone
number for the payphone next to you or a carrier as the destination phone
number so you know right away if the code is good or not (you don't want to
waste time waiting for an answer).  It's hard to say how long this could
take. It may be a few minutes, or you may have to take a few days on the same
dial-up. You might want to circulate dial-ups for a change. You may have
better luck with a different dial-up.

     2. If you can find a good code-hacking program that works with your
modem, and you feel like taking chances, set it up to hack. Here are some
ways to make you more elusive and prolong your life as a successful phreaker.
I will present these from a CodeThief point of view. Hopefully they will be
versatile enough to adapt to your own code-hacking program:

     1. Enter as many dial-ups as you can into your extender
          database.
     2. Hack using "multiple extenders/multiple targets".
     3. Never hack codes sequentially.
     4. Pause for a few seconds between attempts.
     5. Enter "dummy" numbers. These can be numbers of people you
          want to piss off, or disconnected numbers, etc.

     The idea of these tips is to increase the randomness of your hacking
session. They are by no means the only ways of making you scan more chaotic.
The basic concept is, the more random you are, then less obvious you are, and
the longer your life in the wonderful world of phreaking.

     3. The final method is hacking codes from your house, through a
diverter. You can do this basically the same way as hacking from a payphone;
using the same dial-up everytime, and a page full of random numbers. First,
find yourself a diverter. From there, call your target dial-up and hack from
there. This technique is very tedious because everytime you get an error
recording, you have to hang up and then dial-up your diverter again, and then
enter in the 950-xxxx again, and then enter in a different code, and then
hang up and start all over again. So Jewish Lightning devised a way to get
around that. The problem is you need a working code first; one that will
allow you to "pound off" of it. This means, that when you make a call with
it, after you are done, you can hold down the pound key for a second, and it
will give you the extender tone. From here, you do not need to enter the code
again, simply the number you are calling. Sorry guys, but with this method,
it takes codes to make codes. Here's the general idea:

     1. Call up your diverter.
     2. From there, call the dial-up for your working code.
     3. enter your working code.
     4. enter the number for the target dial-up.
     5. enter random CODE+ACN.
     6. When you get the error recording, "pound off".
     7. You are now at step 4. Repeat steps 4-6 until success.


QUATRo - Distribute and Use da codes:

Now that you've got a code or two, or three, you're going to want to hold on
to these as long as you can, and of course, you don't want the gestapo to
come a-knocking at your door, so let's talk about these two things.
     How NOT to get caught:  Once you get your codes, you could use them from
your house, but i don't recommend doing that directly. If you have one, use
a diverter. If you don't, find one. You can find an outdial on Meridian Mail
systems (not all, but a few), and you can set yourself up with a diverter
from a Sys75 if you read PM's guide to hacking Sys75's. Second of all, use it
from payphones. Don't always use it to call home though, that's just as good
as using it from home. Call some friends. Just as with hacking, the more
random you are, the less chance you have of getting nabbed. Finally, give
your codes out. Now t-files out there say "don't give out your codes. let
them hack their own codes." but we're here to tell you that it's best to
share the wealth. That's right. We're telling you to give them out. Not to
everyone, but to a circle of friends. Why? it's part of increasing the
randomness. Say BLAH BLAH communications DOES have ANI...by giving out your
codes to a select few, you have increased the number of call-origination
points, the more these people have to investigate, and the less chance they
have of coming full-force at you. If by some small stroke of bad luck you get
a phone call of some kind, you can always blame it on someone else, becuase
the phone company you fucked with KNOWS that you aren't the only person with
the code. Give 'em Razors VMB or some shit like that. Most companies with
950's are small, regional companies. Chances are they don't have the
resources to fund a full-scale criminal investigation. But remember that
these are just chances. There's also always that slim chance that they CAN
get you, so be careful.
     How to MAKE it LAST: The secret to making codes last it self control.
When you get a few codes, don't be stupid and start calling all your favorite
k-neeto bbs's nation-wide. Use it sparingly. When you give it out to your
small circle of friends, make sure you can trust them to use it wisely also.
If you excercise some self control, one code can last months.

        A recent case that is currently being sought to be brought on trial
 deals with Encryption and Private Security.  This sparked a fire inside
 me that I would like to share.  Physical Security.  Now Encryption is
 great for when you get busted or when it's time for you to send your latest
 hacking tips over the network but what about when someone breaks in and
 steals all your disks?  Then what?

        Now, I personally have been stealing and robbing places ever since
 I was 14 years old and until recently I still kept going.  Now I would
 like to take some time out to tell you about physical security.

        "I don't believe any system is totally secure." - 'David Lightman'
                                                           Matthew Broadrick
                                                           War Games

        Now, there are many layers of security in the world...let's take
        them step by step.

 Part I: Exterior Security

        I spent some time in Gilliam Youth Center in Denver (a month) and
        during that time I started to ponder security to a extreme extent.

        Gilliam would be graded a low-security detention center.
        Their layout was described as seperate pods.  You have a total of
        20 seperate rooms in each pod usually houseing 1-2 people in each
        room.  The doors themselves had no door handles inside the room
        but had a deadbolt when there was a lockdown.  The normal locks
        were often circumvented by useing the plastic combs they would give
        for hair.  The room itself usually had one pod monitor that sat at
        a desk near a door going into the main complex.  The cafeteria and
        such were across the yard and they did check for silverware (it was
        plastic but...)

        The fence was a plastic/metalic tight chainlink that you couldn't
        climb normally but I watched as 2 kids about 13 and 15 scaled it
        just useing 2 toothbrushes sharpened down so that they could just
        climb the fence like a pegboard.  They had metal posts that people
        used to just climb up and hop on the roof and over the fence
        but they used axle grease and made them a little harder to go up.

        Gilliam wouldn't be impossible to get out of.  Actually useing a
        little organization you could get out quite easily and without much
        damage.  Their classrooms are arranged as such so all you need to
        do is break a window (grant it it has wire mixed with it so it's a
        little harder but not impossible) and zing! On to a roof, then
        the ground then out the employee gates.


        Now for breaking into buildings.

        Fences are just one means of security.  My father and grand-father
        has built them for the past 25 years so I think I could be considered
        an expert since I had to deal with the shit for the early years of
        my life.

        Most business places have what's called in the industry "Chain Link".
        This is relatively easy to work with and can be broken through
        easily.  Now there are many security options for this fence.  One
        is vibration detection.  There is usually a cable that runs in the
        bottom two links of the fence.  The cable senses any serious
        vibrations along the fence and then signals that to a main control box
        to which in turn sends it to the security monitoring place.

        This is not too hard to defeat...just wait till it's windy outside
        or even a little breezy and then shake a few sections of fence at
        the pole and then have another person cut a hole into the fence
        to crawl through above the cable but wide enough to go through.

        Crawling over the wire was something I never liked to do.  Usually
        I would just cut a hole but sometimes you are able to.  Now
        the owners can install what's called "Barbed Wire" across the
        top.  This is just a pair of wires with about every foot and a half
        that has a little barb with sharpened ends.  But sometimes
        you will get what I call "Nasty Shit".  Razor Ribbon is a costly
        expense for the owner but it is a definate sign of someone
        saying.."Go Away".  It is possible to cut with bolt cutters but
        it is spring loaded so it will spring back to get you.

        Now in 'Sneakers' they mentioned 'Laser Fencing'.  This is
        just normal chain-link fenceing with an added twist.  The laser
        acts as a super-sensitive vibration detector or can be rigged
        for a 'tripwire' type security.  If this is the case..I would
        think of another way around it.  Laser Fencing is expensive
        as hell usually means that they have some security force in
        the perimeter.

        Card Key security is an effective measure of security but I won't go
        into it because I am just writeing this as a quick overview of
        general security.  There are a few types.  Some are magnetic
        strip readers.  Then you have some that use magnetic wires inside
        the card which are more durable.  There really is no way of getting
        past this security because of the encryption that is involved.
        Well not easily anyway..

        Now most external areas have cameras.  Usually mounted near lights
        so they aren't visible at night.  The best way of getting past them
        is do day survellance of the site.  You can usually time how long
        it takes for it to move from one side to another.  Make notes of the
        duration between sweeps and make sure that you have your timeing down
        to a T.  But for cost effective reasons, cameras are usually places
        near doors.

        I Remember watching an 'A-TEAM' where they had to defeat a type of
        security like such.  So good old Murdock crawled next to the camera
        without being detected and just took a picture of the area...Good
        idea when daylight but not too effective at night.  Best to just
        tap into the armored cable coming from the video camera, create a
        millisecond of static while you attach a cable splitter to it and
        record about 10 minutes of tape and stick it on continous replay.


        Now all of the stuff I just mentioned is going to the extreme of
        things because just like any other business they have to keep cost
        conscious about these things.  Most companies don't have the money
        to buy alot of external protection other than the normal fences
        with barbed wire and maybe (big maybe) a camera outside the main door.


PART II: Interior Security

        When I was in California, I learned about security systems and
        such.  I learned that most offices usually had door and window
        protection and some of the more richer offices usually had motion
        detection.  Just remember 2 rules.

        1) Never be too lax when you enter a building, especially when it
           comes to being paranoid.

        2) Never be in a rush to break into anything.  If there is going
           to be a time crunch.  Do it another time...there will be
           better opportunities.

        Most offices in warmer climates usually don't lock their windows
        due to the fact of because they are always opening the window
        anyway and people just get lazy.  That's what happen with many
        places that I have hit.

        Most offices now at days have computers in them.  They also
        have little refrigerators, microwaves, a little radio, phones
        and such..maybe a small copy machine or fax.

        We entered this one building through a vacant office hopeing
        to enter their phone room and reprogram their pbx...well since
        we entered a empty office we couldn't get in to the core of the
        building.  So we discovered that the walls between offices
        were just going up to the top of the ceiling tiles.  So we tossed
        the lightest of us over the wall, he fell through the tiles and
        landed on a couch.  We then ran out of the building for a while to
        see if there was any cops coming...when it was all clear we went back
        in and looked around always looking out the windows for anyone pulling
        up.


        This particular score gave us 5 386's (At the time were the hottest
        things around) 2 VCR's, 2 fax machines, a tv, a phone, a flatbed
        scanner, 2 dot matrix printers and 1 laser printer.  And 10
        old Apple //e computers sitting in a stack in the back room.

        Needless to say that particular one we cleaned house, but nothing
        like when we another one we did in the same building 2 years later
        which managed to yield 2 486's and a whole network of Macintosh
        computers.

        Shame....


PART III: Planning

        Now I am not one to blow sunshine up anyone's ass when it comes
        to planning.  Planning is needed for most operations.  When
        we entered those buildings, we had a team of 5 people.  One
        was sitting in a car overlooking the entrance to the place.  One
        to keep tabs on communications and make sure that the coast was
        clear and 3 for penetration.  All people had radio communications
        useing 2-meter ham radios set to low power settings on a obscure
        frequency.  We only used the radios to talk to anyone that was not
        in the same room or for talking to the people outside.  (We
        later moved up to Motorola Business Frequency radios due to the
        fact we found them in one office.)

        The car would sit and watch the entrance was also monitoring police
        band radio for any calls to the area and relaying if there were any
        cars passing by especially cop cars just cruseing around.

        The second person makeing sure we were informed when a call came
        from anyone and playing second watch also had a car available for
        cargo purposes.

        Then the 3 people were usually computer experienced in some way
        to deal with the large amount of cables required in disconnecting
        the systems and makeing sure cables and documentation was gathered.

        As you can see, this was a good setup.   Let me give you a full
        transcript of what we did for the first one.

        <Synergetics.....El Cajon, California>
        <11:30pm>

        Car 1 arrives at the target to begin monitoring all traffic inside
        and outside the area.  He calls in on his 2-meter radio. "Nine-one      to base"
        to base."
        "Roger, Nine-One"
        "Target clear...2 cars in lot..look abandoned."
        "Roger. Received...Base out."

        <1:45am>
        Car 2 approaches target site...
        "Nine-Two to Nine-One"
        "Roger, Nine-Two"
        "Approaching target, will be in visual in 5 minutes"
        "Confirmed. Nine-One out.."

        <1:50am>
        Car 2 enters target area and then immediately kills it's lights
        parks near the entrance to the building in a shadowy area.

        3 men move quickly out of the car and begin trying windows
        to find if anyone locked the one they found earlier that were
        unlocked.  The found that 2 were but the third wasn't.  They
        poke a head inside with a mini-flashlight looking at the ceiling
        for any ultrasonic or motion detectors for extra insurance.  Satisfied
        they move quickly into the office and begin takeing inventory of
        all the items.  They find a local network of macs and laserprinters
        and a host of 486 servers.  They begin to remove cables and cords
        from the wall and start rooting through drawers to find
        anything in the drawers for documentation and disks.

        "Nine-One to Strike, Be advised that one police cruiser has past
        target....no sign of stopping"

        "Roger"

        One strike member finds a small pbx controller (A Meridian) which
        he then trys to hunt for manuals (which he finds near the end)

        All the stuff begins to pile up near the entrance while they make
        sure that nothing was missed..

        "Strike-One to Nine-Two come in for pickup"

        "Roger"

        Car 2 moves into position with a popped hatch...(An acura integra)
        and they begin to haul in all the stuff...which fills up quickly...

        "Nine-Two to Nine-One...come in for assistance"

        "Roger"

        Car 1 comes in to pick up the rest of the stuff and picks up
        the rest of the team members...(A Ford Bronco II)

        All the people are ready and the place was swept to
        make sure that no prints were left if any..

        All the equipment then was taken to one of the team member's garage
        and was hidden.  Then the group was then assembled at the local
        donut shop watching the cops eye them...


That was one of the better ones...I have had where the owners were concerned
one day and they just installed a security system the same day we enter
the target and had a close run in with the police...therefore the necessity
of good communication as any military infantry man could tell you.


        Oh well...so ends another submission into CoTNO....

        Remember to "FIGHT THE POWERS THAT BE!"

  Introduction
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The IRC can be a fun and productive tool for communication over the
  internet.  If used correctly, it can provide many hours of conversation 
  with and about any imaginable person or thing, respectivly.  The 
  knowledgable IRC user will be able to find the channels or people he 
  needs with grace, and use these to his advantage.  The knowledgable user
  will be able to keep up with kicks, bans, de-ops, and other tasteless
  ploys that other users try to play on him.  A knowledgable IRC user is
  a good IRC user.
        This guide to the IRC will be split into sections, regarding 
  subject matter.  The sections are as follows:

     1.................What is IRC?
     2.................Hooking in to the IRC
     3.................Basic techniques on the IRC
     4.................Operator status on the IRC
     5.................Useful techniques on the IRC
     6.................Other techniques on the IRC


  1. What is IRC?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        IRC is an acronym, which stands for Internet Relay Chat.  It is a 
  real-time chat network over the Internet.  This means that one person can
  be talking from a computer in Texas, while another person can be talking
  from a computer in Germany, and all speach from Texas will be seen 
  instantly in Germany, and all speach from Germany seen instantly in Texas.
  Real conversations can take place, with no lag.  
        The IRC is split into channels, created by the users.  If you join
  a channel, you are talking to the users who are in that channel.  So 
  people can talk about whatever they want on the IRC.  There are ways to
  have private conversations, also.
        All in all, the possibilities of the IRC are endless.

  
  2. Hooking in to the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There are many different ways to hook in to the IRC.  It is mostly
  done through clients.
        A client is a software program that is on the machine you are using
  to connect to the IRC.  The client connects with the IRC server, and you
  are thus hooked into the IRC network.  This is all around the best way
  to hook into the IRC.  If you are on a fast machine, you will have a very
  fast connection to the IRC, without lag.  This does not take up more then
  3 megs of drive space, so it won't break most users' quotas.  It does not
  keep a process open, so the SysAdmin won't get angry.  And it's very easy
  to install.
        On the other hand, one can set up an IRC server.  For this, you will
  need to have root, and/or own the machine.  You will need access to the 
  Internet Ports on the machine.  If you run a server, you will be able to
  get IRC Operator status (IRCop), which has many benefits.  I will go into
  more detail on this later.
        There are also servers all around the net which one can access the
  IRC on.  These servers are generally European, so people in the United 
  States waste bandwidth when calling them.  The servers are slow, and over-
  used.  Generally, these are useful only if one of the two aforementioned
  techniques are totally unavailable.  Servers are generally considered to
  be sleazy on the IRC, and you may be kicked out of a channel just for 
  being on one.  I would not reccomend ever using a server.
        The final way to hook into the IRC is through what is known as
  "raw IRC."  Raw IRC is very low quality.  You are recieving the same data
  that your IRC client would recieve, as you are hooked directly into the
  server.  The data is unfiltered, and very ugly.  It is more difficult to
  do anything with raw IRC.  This is definately the last choice in using 
  IRC.  If everything else is unavailable, Raw is the way to go.  Other then
  that, forget about it.
         Clients, Servers, and Help packages can all be obtained through
  ftp.santafe.edu.  You will want to get the latest version of the IRC
  II package.  This is the latest IRC client.  
        To install the client package, first uncompress, then detar it
  into your user directory.  Next, type install, and go through the
  questions which it asks.  It will ask for server name.  Mattering on where
  you are located, you will enter the closest server.  The most popular that 
  I have seen are:
        
        irc.colorado.edu
        irc.netsys.com
        irc.mit.edu
                   
         All of these servers are fast and efficient.  irc.netsys.com is
  slightly more widely used.  After you tell your IRC server all of your
  system/server specs, it will go on to compile itself.  Now you will have
  an IRC client.  Simply type "irc" to enter the client.
        I have never installed a server, so I don't know anything about it
        To go to the raw IRC, telnet to one of the servers, port 6667.
  You will get no feed from the server.  Type 
           user a b c d [enter]
  Where 'user' is the command user, a is the account name you are using,
  b is any random number, c is any random number, and d is your IRC quote,
  which should be between quotes.
       Next, type 
           nick username [enter]
  where nick is the command nick, and username is the nickname you wish
  to be known by on the IRC.  You will now see the server's message of
  the day, and you will be able to proceed to use the IRC.
        To get to an anonymous IRC server, first you must telnet to one.
  These go up and down too fast to list them here.  They can be obtained
  usually by asking around on bulletin boards.  It will ask for a username.
  Enter the nickname you want to be known by.  It will then ask for a 
  terminal emulation.  Enter this.  If you have chosen VT100, the server
  will look just like an IRC client.  Most likely the server will be very
  slow.  Use it just like an IRC client.
       As a side note, if you set up an IRC client, it is reccomended that
  you add the help package to your system.  It is much faster and better
  then the help bot which resides on the IRC.


  3. Basic techniques on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Once you are hooked in to the IRC network in some way, the next
  logical move is to begin using it.  The following directions will be
  for people using the IRC through either a client, a telnet server, or
  through their own server, as accessed from a client.  People using raw
  IRC should enter the same basic commands, but without /'s.  All talk to
  and from channels, and between persons while on the raw IRC should be 
  through the privmsg command.  Once in a channel, enter "privmsg
  <channel> <message>,"  And the message will go through to the channel.
  If you substitute a person's name for the channel name, the message will
  go through to that person.  
       Basic client commands are:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------   
  Command        Usage               Summary of usage
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  /join         /join <channel>      This command is used to join a 
                                     channel.  If the channel has a key
                                     on it (see operator section) then
                                     the key should be added to the command
                                     after the channel name.  This can also
                                     be used to start a new channel.
      
      For instance, if you want to join #warez, you type:
           /join #warez
      
      But if #warez has a key on it, which is "doomrules"
           /join #warez doomrules
      
      Or, say you want to start your own channel, called "#l0ser" you will 
      type:
           /join #l0ser
      
      You will be in your channel, with operator status.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /nick         /nick <name>         This command will change your IRC 
                                     nickname.  This is the name that people
                                     see you under.

      For instance, if your name is "Lamer" and you want to change it to
      "K00lGuy" you would type:
           /nick K00lGuy
      You will now be known as "K00lGuy."

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /msg          /msg <name/channel> <message>    This command sends a private
                                                 message to a person, or a 
                                                 public message to a channel.
      
      For instance, if you want to call Pot a lamer, you would type:
           /msg pot you lamer!
      Now Pot will know that he is a lamer.
      
      Or, say you want to insult the people on #hack for banning you.  
      You type
           /msg #hack You lamers!  You banned my sorry ass!

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /me           /me <message>        This will make a message come out
                                     as an "action."
  
      For instance, say you want to say that you think U4EA just said a 
      stupid thing, you would type:
           /me thinks that U4EA is a dumbass!
      
      If your nickname happens to be Tremolo, it will come out as:
           * Tremolo thinks that U4EA is a dumbass!

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /leave        /leave <channel>     This will make you leave a channel.
  
      For instance, if you are hangin on #warez, and get tired of sittin with
      Elminster, you can type:
           /leave #warez
      Now, you won't have to deal with Elminster's shit any longer!

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /who          /who <channel>       This will tell you who is on a 
                                     given channel.
      
      For instance, say you are on #lamers, #warez, and #hack.  You want to
      know who's on #hack, so you type
           /who #hack
      It will tell you everyone who's on, their operator status, their user 
      comment, their system's address, and other useless information.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /whois        /whois <nickname>    This will give you information
                                     on a person.

  For instance, if you want to know all about RAgent, you can type 
           /whois RAgent
  It will tell you his comment, his nick, his system's address, it will
  tell you what server he is using, and a little bit about the server.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

         
         Those are all the basic commands you will need to get around on the
  IRC, for the most part.  For commands to execute when you are the channel
  operator, see the IRC Operator section.  For more advanced commands, see
  the Useful Techinques section.
         To talk, while on any channel, simply type in your text and press
  enter.  As I stated above, while on raw IRC, you will have to privmsg
  to the channel in order to talk to it.


  4. Operator Status on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If you happen to notice that someone changes the mode on a certain
  channel to +o <your name>, or you see an @ symbol next to your name on your
  IRC client/telnet server, you will know that you have operator status in
  that channel.  This can be a very useful thing to have.
        Also, operator status will be given whenever you start a channel.
        The main command you will use if you have this status is the /mode
  command.  This command controls all the settings for a given channel.
  There are many flags that can be used with the /mode, and the command is
  typed as follows:
         
         /mode <channel> <+/-><flag(s)> <(optional)name>
         All flags are either + (there) or - (not there).  
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Flag                       Usage
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  o                      The operator flag.  If someone has this flag, they
                         are a channel operator.
                         This flag requires a name.
  
      For instance, if you are Serpent, and you want to give channel operator 
      status to Pluvius, and you are on #warez, you would type:
           /mode #warez +o pluvius
      and IRC would return:
           *** Mode changed to +o Pluvius on #warez by Serpent
  
      Say he starts to annoy you...
           /mode #warez -o pluvius
      Suddenly, Pluvius has no operator status any more.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  b                      The banned flag.  If you have this, you are banned.
                         If you give this to someone, they are banned.
                         This flag requires a name.
  
      For instance, say that you don't want Y-WiND0Ze in your channel which 
      happens to be #tacobell, you would give him the +b flag: 
           /mode #tacobell +b y-wind0ze
      and he wouldn't be able to join.  He would be banned.
        
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  i                      This flag makes a channel invite-only.                      
  
      If this flag is engaged, the channel is a private channel.  No one can 
      get in without being invited.  

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  m                      Makes the channel moderated.
  
      This flag, when given to a channel, makes the channel be moderated.  
      This means that only the channel operators can talk.  This is a very 
      useless command.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  n                      This makes it so that no messages can be sent to
                         the channel.
      
      For instance, if Kbg keeps messaging to the channel, asking to be 
      invited, you can add this flag.  Ahhhh.. Silence.
      Kbg can no longer say anything to the channel, unless he somehow 
      gets in.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  s                      This makes the channel secret. 
  
      If the channel is secret, it will not show up on any channel listings.
      There will be no way for a person to find the channel unless he knows 
      about it.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  p                       This makes the channel private.
  
      The channel, in channel listings, will be listed as "*Private*," instead
      of being listed by it's name.  This is good for hiding the channel, but
      letting people know that something is there.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  l                        This sets the max number of users in a channel.
  
      This command is, for the most part, useless.  It's good for having a 
      scaled-down channel where only a few people can come in, so that the
      channel will stay fairly quiet.  Other then that, it's just fun to use 
      to set to neat numbers.  For instance, say you're in #BlueBox, and you
      want to be cool, you set the 'l' flag to 2600.  You do this by typing:
              /mode #BlueBox +l 2600
      Now everyone will see that there is a 2600 and say "Trexer is elite!"
      (If your name happens to be Trexer.)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  k                         This sets a channel key. 
  
      A key on a channel means that a passcode must be used to get in.  This
      sets that code.  It is useful for having ONLY who you want to be in the
      channel.  It is also nice, for having a channel where you don't have to
      work and invite everyone, but everyone who should be able to get in will
      have the key.  It is used by typing:
           /mode #keykard +k 494949
  
      Now, to join, someone will have to type:  /join #keykard 494949
      If they don't know the 494949 part, they will not be able to join.

        (There are other irc operator commands, also.)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                            
  /kick                     This kicks someone out of a channel.  
      
      For instance, say that Maelstrom is being lame, in #lamer.  You type:
           /kick #lamer maelstrom
      Now he's out of the channel.  If he's not banned, he can come
      back in.  If he's banned, the channel is invite only, or the
      channel has a key, he will not be able to get back in without 
      taking the proper steps first.
 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  /topic      This sets the topic on a channel.  
      
      So say you're in #redbox and you want everyone to know that you are a 
      good redboxer, and your name happens to be SSerpent.  You would type:
           /topic #redbox SSerpent is a /<-RaD 'Boxer!
      Now everyone who comes in will know.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------


         These are the main operator commands, the ones that are most used.
  Other modes and a few other operator commands exist, but they are not 
  widely used, and are slightly obscure.
         The IRC oprator I am talking about here is not to be confused with
  an IRCop.  An IRCop is a person who has been given a special status by a 
  server which he/she may run, or help to run, or is friends with those who
  run it.  They are operators on every channel on the IRC regardless, and 
  they have the ablility to /kill someone, which means to disconnect that 
  person from their server.  /kill is a stupid and useless thing, and is
  not something to worry about.  If you are /kill'ed, simply /server <server>
  <server> being whatever server you use.  You will now be back on the IRC.
 
  5. Useful Techniques on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There are a few other techniques on the IRC which did not seem
  to fit in any of the previous sections.  These techniques are not to
  be discounted, though, as they are very useful.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------   
  Command              Summary of usage
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /dcc                 This is one of the more useful commands on the IRC.
                       It is a file transfer command, as well as a private
                       message command.  It cannot be used from an anonymous
                       IRC server.
      
      Say you want to send a file called "ellenude.gif" to lonewolf:
           /dcc send lonewolf ellenude.gif
      
      Lonewolf will see this:
           DCC Request recieved (ellenude.gif 39393) from Kilslug 
      the number after the file name is filesize. 
      
      Lonewolf will proceed to type:
           /dcc get kilslug ellenude.gif
      Now his DCC will start recieving it.
                       
      If he wants to see the progress of the transfer, he would type 
           /dcc list  
      He will see the file name, who's sending, etc.. If he is recieving 
      the file, he will see the bytes gotten in the "read" column.  If
      he is sending, he will see the bytes gotten in the "sent" column.  
                       
      The other use of DCC is to send private messages.
      The only part of the IRC which is not logged in any way at any time, 
      according to the IRC-II Help files, is by DCC chat.  Say you want to 
      engage DCC chat with Cairo, you would type:
           /dcc chat Cairo
      
      If Cairo wants to chat with you, he will type
           /dcc chat CryptKepr
      
      To send a message to Cairo, CryptKepr would type
           /msg =cairo <message>
      Notice the = sign.  This makes it a DCC message.
 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /ignore              This allows you to ignore someone.  No messages at
                       all will be recieved from them.  Period.  The only
                       thing you will see from them will be if you list 
                       members of a channel; they will appear in the listing.
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /away                Marks you as being away.  If someone pages you, they 
                       will recieve your away note telling them you're not
                       there.  Also, their page will be logged for you to 
                       see later.  
      
      If you want to tell everyone that you're milking your cow, you 
      would type:
           /away Milking my cow, be back later!
      Now everyone will know what you're doing and why you're not there.
      
      To end, type /away alone.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /mode                There are also personal /mode commands.  The two most
                       important are +i and +n.  The i flag makes it so that
                       no one can get information on you without specifying
                       your exact name.  Someone listing a channel if they
                       are not inside won't see you there if you have the
                       i flag on.
                       
                       The n flag makes it so that you can't recieve any 
                       pages (msg's.)  This is useful if alot of people are
                       paging you and you want them to shut up.
                       Also, if you want to see who is banned in a channel,
                       regardless of operator status or even being in that
                       channel, you can type /mode <channel> +b
                       It will tell you all the people/sites currently
                       banned within the channel.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /query               This will put you on a permanent mode talking to 
                       someone.  
      
      If you type:
           /query lestat
      everything you type from then on will go to lestat just like you were 
      msg'ing him.  This is useful if you have a lot to say and don't want 
      to /msg all the time.  
      
      To end, type: 
           /query 

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /bind                This is used to bind special characters to certain
                       actions.  The most important of these is the 
                       IRC_STOP bind.  
      
      To set this up, type:
           /bind ^Z IRC_STOP
      This will make it so that when you type ^Z, you will "shell" out of IRC, 
      making it into a backround process.  As many people who use IRC know, 
      it is sometimes annoying not being able to ^Z out.  Now you can, with 
      ease.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /exec                This command is used to EXECute a command from the
                       UNIX shell, without ever leaving IRC.  
  
      For instance, if you want to do a ls -al, from IRC, you just type:
           /exec ls -al
      It will show you all the files in your directory, in your IRC window, 
      instead of you having to ^Z out, or exit out.  You can execute any 
      command that will work in sh with /exec.  

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  /load                This command is used to load an IRC script.  
                       
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        
        There are also two important IRC environment variables that you can
  set.  These are IRCNICK and IRCNAME.  The IRCNICK variable is your default
  nickname on the IRC.  Once you go in, and your nickname is whatever you
  set IRCNICK to, it can still be changed by the /nick command.  It is not
  a permanent setting.  
        The IRCNAME variable sets your user comment to whatever you want it
  to be.  This is the comment about you that people will see when they do a
  /whois command on you.
        These variables can be set from the csh command line with 
  setenv IRCNICK <nickname>
  setenv IRCNAME "<stuff>"
        Notice the quotes with IRCNAME.  This is an important part of it.


  6. Other Techniques on the IRC
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There have been many scripts written for the IRC, to do some nice
  fun things. 

  -------------------------------------------------------------------   
  Script              Summary of usage
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  tsunami             This is a flood script, which is designed to drive 
                      a person off of the IRC.  It is very effective, if
                      the user has a good copy of it.  It sends page after
                      page of EI and IE combonations, very quickly.  Some
                      better quality versions send actual messages, and 
                      greetings, such as "Lamer," "fuck off," "leave now,"
                      "Fuck you," "go away," and other fun greetings.
                      This script is very fun to use/abuse.

      It is run under the perl system, by executing the command:
           /exec perl tsunami <username> 
      After which, the user will see several telnet error messages, and the 
      reciever of the tsunami will begin to recieve constant junk.
                      
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  utc                 The UTC reply bomb is a script which takes advantage
                      of a bug in earlier versions of the IRC-II client.
                      The bomb "bombs" the client with junk, and causes it
                      to lose connection to it's server, engaging "error
                      0."  This bomb also works on some VMS systems.  It
                      is very fun to bomb an entire channel such as 
                      #gaysex and watch all of them suddenly log off with
                      "error 0."
      
      The script is /load'ed, then is executed, usually with:
           /bomb <username>
      or
           /bomb *   to bomb the current channel.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  vmsbomb             This is a myth, in my oppinion.  I have never seen 
                      this script either in action, or in source.  It is
                      supposed to be able to disable all VMS systems
                      regardless of version number.  Yeah.  I'll believe
                      it when I see it.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  icmp                The ICMP bomb is a much talked about bomb on the
                      IRC.  It is, in reality, not an IRC script, but a 
                      modified ping program.  It is designed to destroy
                      logical links between systems.  It's use on the IRC
                      is fairly obvious:  Run it on a server, watch all
                      of the people on the server drop off like flies, 
                      and watch the chaos begin.  Mega netsplit.  (netsplits
                      are times when the servers are split up and not 
                      communicating.)  I have the source to one of these,
                      but I can't get it to work correctly.  If anyone 
                      has a working copy, I would appreciate it if you
                      could get it to me.
      Usage would be:
           /exec icmp <servername>

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Xdcc                There are many versions of this script floating 
                      around.  It is a script which helps to automate
                      DCC sessions.  I, personally, do not use it, and 
                      do not like it.  But many, many people do.  So
                      try it out...
  
      Usage:  THe script is /load'ed, then takes care of itself from there, 
      for the most part.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Toolz               A great guy called Yazoo writes a big script for
                      the IRC called Yazoo's Toolz.  These are very 
                      helpful, and has many nice options.  Xdcc was, 
                      for the most part, stolen from Yazoo's Toolz.  But
                      Yazoo knows how to program it much better.  It has
                      many nice commands, such as mega-de-op, flood 
                      protection, ban protection, etc.. It also has nice
                      features such as keeping logfiles, and highlighting
                      important information like pages.  Also, it can
                      be used as a type of bot, as it has the ability to
                      op people automatically on command, and to distribute
                      files on command automatically.  This is a very
                      nice script and is a must have.
      
      Usage:
           /load the script file, then do a /commands for a list of commands.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  (A Command that makes no sense:)
  /ping            hello!?  what the hell is this thing for??  Tells
                   you how many seconds it takes your system to send a 
                   data packet to another user's system, and for their
                   system to send it back.  -- Who cares??
                   If anyone finds a use for this, tell me.

      Usage:
           /ping <username>
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Bots:

        IRC Bots are scripts that act a certain way, and do whatever they
  are told/programmed to do.  Many, many bots are out there, and they do
  alot of different things.  The most common bots are there to give certain
  people operator status when they enter a channel.  The bot has an internal
  list of people that it is programmed to give operator status to, and it
  gives the status to these people.  If you can make friends with a bot
  operator, you can get on the list and you can get ops whenever you come
  into the channel.  
        Other bots are there to distribute files.  This 'zine, for instance
  may soon be distributed by a bot of my programming.  Bots which distribute
  files go around, send people messages "download the file by sending me 
  this message" .. when the message is sent, the bot sends the file via
  DCC connection.  
        There is another breed of bot, which I call an IdiotBot.  These
  are bots which sit there, and do anything anyone tells them to do.  They
  are there to serve.  Not just their master, no.  But everyone, on every
  channel they happen to be in.  Say I want ops in #hack.  IdiotBot is
  in there, and the bot has ops.  I just send him a message:
      /msg idiotbot mode #hack +o p_modern
  if you read the area on ops, you would see that this mode is the 
  operator status mode.  Now, I'll have operator status, and I can go and
  do what I want.  These bots have no control, and I urge all operators
  to kill them off on site.  Sooner or later, some asshole gets the ops from
  the bot, and fucks over the channel, pulling all ops out with a script,
  and putting a +m on, making the channel totally useless.  Don't let this
  happen.  Kill IdiotBots everywhere.
        There are many, many other bots.  Some interesting ones I have seen:
  
  - a bot that bans people if they try to ban the people on the bot's list
  - a bot that calls master.. strange, though, master never comes.
  - many different greeting bots "Hi, how are you today?"
  - A bot that tells sexual stories about the smurfs

  Closing
  ~~~~~~~
        I hope you enjoyed the article, and learned something about the
  IRC.  I hope that if your name was mentioned, you found it to be humorous
  and did not take it seriously.  I must now issue a warning:
                           
                           *** WARNING ***
        Do NOT take the IRC seriously.  I have seen too many people go
  crazy over someone on the IRC, get all pissed off, and try to kill that
  person in some way.  The IRC is virtual, it's bullshit.  If someone fucks
  with you, fuck 'em back.  It's that simple.  If you're really mad, go
  beg an operator in #pub or #talk to /kill 'em.  But don't take anything
  outside the IRC.  I've done it myself, and it wasn't worth it.
        Do NOT start flame wars in public on the IRC.  No one wants to 
  hear it, most of the time.  It takes away from the real conversation.
        Just have fun, do whatcha want on the IRC.  No one can fuck with
  you there.  And don't post things on the IRC which you want to keep ..
  for instance.. a code, posted on the IRC in #hack, will die very very
  quickly.  It's just not worth it.  Be careful who you tell things to
  while on the IRC.  If you tell the wrong person, or if you make a 
  typing mistake and it's broadcasted to everyone.. Disaster..

        Already time for another submission to COTNO?  Seems just like 
last week I wrote for the first COTNO.  Well in this submission i'll be 
talking about Meet-Me conferences and Dial-In Bridges, how to set them up, 
and methods of billing (not that we pay of course).  


        The most popular and the most convenient conferences are of course the
AT&T Dial-In bridges. These are the conferences that most everyone is familiar
with.  God knows how many AT&T conference's Dead Kat and I set up.  To damn 
many to count thats for sure.  But as DK and I found out, we had more fun 
setting them up than actually calling into them, but thats just us I guess.

First things first, to set up conference's you must Beige Box, at least 
this is the most convienent way so we'll just stick with that for now.  Now I 
will not be explaining what a Beige is or how to make one since there are
probably more T-files on that box than any other.  You can even find them on 
your local PD board.  But get your beige box and get ready to field phreak.

This is just a suggestion but before you get out there and hook up I would 
have the info and equipment you will need to set up the conference.  You don't 
need alot of shit.  All you need is a Pen and a piece of paper, and maybe 
something hard to write on.  I recommend a pen over a pencil for obvious 
reasons.  It would not be cool to break your lead while on the phone with the 
Meet-Me operator.  On the piece of paper you should write the number of the 
Tele-Conference service and either your local ANI or an 800. I will post all 
the number's and other information you will need to know at the end of this 
article.

Ok, when you have all your equipment go hook up your beige to wherever you
beige from.  Now the only time I beige is when I am gonna set up a conference 
and it's never from the same location.  Since it's usually at different times 
of the day or night, I never know if the owner of the phone line is home or 
not.  So what i've found to work best is when you're hooking up to your line 
make sure it has call waiting.  The operator will call you back after you set 
up the conference and having the owner of the phone line pick up his phone 
could lead to some very uncomfortable moments!  You can find a line with call 
waiting by hitting *70 on every line until you hear the three short dialtones.  
I hope everyone knows what I mean.  

Anyway, call the ANI and write the number down because the operator will 
ask you what number you're calling from, this is how they bill the number.  
Next call the tele-conference service and set up your meet-me's. The rest is 
basically talking with the operator and bullshitting her (or Bolshit as 
Visionary would say).  I'm not gonna tell you what to say to her.  I mean it 
might take you a couple of try's before you know what to say and are 
convincing enough, but I will tell you this, keep it short and simple. 
As Dead Kat and I have found out, it's easier to just say:  "I need six 
conference's set for the 1st,2nd,3rd,etc.. of December... from 6pm to 2:00am 
MST.. and I want to bill them to the number I'm calling from..."  We have set 
more than 8 conference's up in just one call. There's no need to make one call 
for every conference.  Oh, and I almost forgot, she will ask you how many ports 
you want.  What she means is how many lines in do you want.  You can have up 
to 20 ports, but I would not recommend this at all.  Twenty people on a 
conference tends to make it hard to talk to anyone. I would say no more than 
ten, maybe 15 if you know a shit load of people will call, but ten should do 
the trick.

As soon as you hang up with her, dial a number that you know will ring and 
that will let you stay on for a few minutes. A good example is a VMB with a 
long greet or maybe a number that just rings forever.  Stay on the line until 
you hear the call waiting beep and just click over.  When you answer, the op 
will tell you the pin's and numbers for the conferences.

Just work with what you have, you probably will have your own style and what
not, but let me mention this, the op will give you a "Host PIN".  This is
for the person who set it up and no one else.  Just some advice, don't call 
the conference direct and use this code.  You'll end up paying for the meet-me.

Well it's easy.  All you need is a beige box, a place to beige, and the 800
number.  Here are the numbers for the ATT conference's.  These numbers are 
basically the same, you can call either one and set them up.
          
        1-800-232-1111 -AT&T Conference Set-up
        1-800-544-6363 -AT&T Conference Set-up
        1-800-775-5513 -ANI (Good as of 12-31-93)

And I thought i'd give you a little bit of info...

The price per minute is about .45 cents a minute per line, so after the 
conference add up the approx amount of people that were on and how long the
conference was up for and find out how much of a bill it is.  I'm sure the
people who's house you beige from won't be happy when they get there $1000+
bill.  Heh!

This file is made to show the gateways of information that can be
obtained from your local operator.  Skamming your operator, whether it be 
AT&T/MCI/Sprint, or a local bell, is as easy as making a phone call.   


Part I: Picking an Identity
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Choosing the right "occupation" is very important.  Because the general 
public would not normally be able to obtain this information, picking your 
occupation is crucial.  Choose something "telephony", such as Station Repair, 
MTS Security, Toll Service Maintenance, or Central Office Supervisor. You can 
easily find other occupations by trashing a bell office.  Note: do not use the 
names 'Hank Poecher' (re-organized to spell 'phone hacker') or 'Chester Karma'  
(master hacker) invented by Dead Kat.  Almost every Colorado hacker has abused 
AT&T or a bell office via one of these names, and quite possibly the dicks are 
catching on. 


Part II: Skamming
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The phun part.  While skamming, it is important to remember that if you screw 
up with an operator, don't fucking panic.  If they ask you a question that you 
do not know the answer to, just explain that you must ask your supervisor, 
will contact them later.  Call back again, and in most cases you will most 
likely get a different person, so simply start again.  Note: if you choose to 
skam from your house, use a divertor, or a company that doesn't have ANI, or 
a so called 'HaKR tRakR!#%!@%!@%'.  A good company to use for this would be 
Encore (800/288.2880).  Encore has been abused literally thousands of times, 
and, to my knowledge, have taken no security action against a hacker in it's 
over four years of business.  


Skam A - LAC

The LAC stands for Line Assignment Center.  The line assignment center is used 
to obtain a customer's phone number, by giving an operator at the LAC the 
customer's address.  You must have the full street address.  Obtaining the 
number to your desired LAC is a simple process.  

Call up your local bell office and say something to the effect of: 

   "Hello, this is Hank Poecher with station 29 repair, what do you show as 
   the number for the LAC that handles the xxxxx area?"

If you are able to obtain the LAC using this method you are either: 
    a) a good social engineer  
    b) eleet

Once you obtain the desired LAC, call up the LAC office and feed them 
something like:  
   
   "Hello, this is Chester Karma with repair, I have an address here and I 
   need to know the cable pair and phone number going into that address"

(The cable pair isn't neccessary, but if you say cable pair, they are more
likely to think that you are a phone co. employee).


Skam B - CN/A Office/ID

The CN/A stands for Customer Name/Address.  The Customer Name/Address Office 
is used to obtain a customer's name and address (hence the name) by giving an 
operator the the CN/A office the customer's phone number.  You must have the 
full phone number.  To obtain the desired CN/A office and ID, call up your 
local bell office (on occasion, i have heard that Sprint is much easier to 
obtain info from than your local bell office), or the CSSC (Customer Sales 
and Service Center) at 800/222.0300, and say you are from an AT&T office, such 
as the AT&T Northeastern Administrative Offices, or something along the lines 
of that.  When you call, depending on the operator you get, obtaining the 
desired info may be easy, or difficult.  When you finish identifying yourself, 
tell the operator that you were given a bit of incorrect info and need the 
correct information.
 
A simple phone conversation might sound like this:

"This is Hank Poecher from Northeastern Administrative AT&T Offices, and it
appears that we were given a bit of incorrect information.  We were given the 
CN/A number for Washington as 203-789-6815, but it looks like that is the CN/A 
office for Connecticut.  What do you show as the correct number for the CN/A 
in Washington, and it's ID code? Could you check your handbook?  Thank you."

This method has worked many times.  If you fuck up or the operator will not 
give you the CN/A, simply move down the list and try company b.  Now, once 
you finally obtain the CN/A and id,  the next step is rather easy.  Call up 
the CN/A office you obtained by skamming the operators during normal business 
hours, and throw a line like this:

   "Hello, this is Chester Karma down at Sprint.  My code is A12345, and I 
   need a hit on a customer at 206-555-1212.  Thank you."

Try not to sound like an eleven year old, just as real as possible. Again, 
if they ask you a question that you do not know the answer to or the ID given 
does not work, say that you must ask your supervisor and will get back with 
them later. 


Skam C  - Free Payphone Calls

Part 1
First of all, you'll need to know the number of some "silent" or "dead lines".  
"Dead lines" are phone numbers that answer before the first ring and just sit 
there.  The only noise that they make is a "click" when they answer.  Silent 
phone numbers are easy to find.  If you haven't already found one, scan 
(xxx) XXX-1119.  A good one to use is (310) 516-1119.  If you choose to scan 
for dead lines, make note of the one's that answer with the loudest click.  
Once you find two or three of these, write them down and go to your local 
payphone. dial 0 + the number you want to call.  When the operator comes on, 
change your voice and say that you want to "third party bill this number."  
When she asks what number you want to bill to, give her a dead line.   
The operator will then call to "verify" the billing charges while you are 
on-line.  When she calls, listen very closely for the click of the dead line.  
As soon as you hear the dead line click, change your voice again and pretend 
to answer the phone, using "Hello?".  The operator will think that you are 
the person that owns the phone number (dead line), and ask if it's okay for 
whoever to bill to that number.  Just say "yes" and she will put your call 
through.  If this sounds complex at first, practice it until you get it down 
perfectly. What your doing here is acting like both people.  Again, a good 
company to use for this is "Encore" at 800/288.2880.  When you get the 
dialtone, put in any valid number, and go from there.  

Part 2
Billing to the pay-phone next to you is also a very easy way to pull off free 
phone calls from pay-phones.  For this to work, your payphone must: 
   a) accept incoming calls  
   b) be privately owned, such as a COCOT payphone 
   (Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephone), so it doesn't show up as a 
   "payphone" on the operators computer.  
If the payphone you want to bill to doesn't have the number listed on front, 
call an ANI to get the number. Then call up the long distance company of your 
choice, and tell them you want to "third party bill this number" again.  Give 
them the number of the payphone that's right next to you, and wait for them to 
call and verify the charges.  When you answer the other payphone, change your 
voice, and accept the charges.


Skam D - Finding Bridges

Finding a bridge is by far one of the easiest things to social engineer.  
Call information in any state (xxx-555-1212), and ask for the number to 
AT&T NETWORK SYSTEMS for a major city in that state.  Call Network Systems, 
and say you are from Maintenance and need the number to the conference bridge. 
If they don't operate or have a bridge there, just ask for the number to the 
bridge that they use.  


Skam E - Using the Operator to Divert

Finding divertors have always been a hassle.  Some phreakers in their states 
have already abused their diverters to the point of killing them or rendering 
them useless; or you live in a hick town where there are no divertors; or you 
are too lazy to scan for divertors.  But every state, no matter how lame or 
small, has their friendly operator.  Using the operator to divert is easy, 
plus IT'S LEGAL!   Although some states forward ANI information when they 
place a call, MANY DON'T, which makes it an ideal way to divert.  You can test 
your operator by dialing '0', and asking her to call an ANI.  When she puts it 
through, it should sound something like this: "NPA-000-0000".  If it does, 
Your in luck.  if it doesn't, and instead reads of your full phone number, you 
should find some REAL divertors.  Now, to put this to your use, call up the 
operator and tell her that your 'X' (where 'X' is any single digit in the full 
number you wish to call) key is broken (do not say your '0' key is broken, for 
obvious reasons), and ask her to place the call to '(XXX) XXX-XXXX'.  This 
should be an 800 number, or a local number.  She will put the call through.  
using this method of diverting is very useful for calling an 800 AT&T 
conference when you want to use the host, or calling an 800 PBX.  You can also 
use it for 950's or local calls. 
 
Look for the eleet conclusion (part 2) of operator skams coming soon...

(A take off on "A Whole New World" from Aladdin)
 
      [Editor's Note - When I first saw this posted on Flatline I nearly
      died laughing.  JF didn't warn me or Karb0n at all.  I thought you
      might get a laugh out of it as well!]

DeadKat- I can call around the world
         Hacking, boxing, internetworking
         Tell me, Karb0n, now when did
         You last let your voice go far?
 
         I can open your lines
         Take you system by system
         Over, sideways and under
         On a electronic tone we fly
 
         A whole new world
         A new fantastic point of view
         No one to tell us no
         Or where to go
         Or say we're doing it illegal
 
Karb0n-  A whole new world
         A dazzling world I never knew
         But when I'm calling through here
         It's crystal clear
         that now I'm in a whole new world with you
 
DeadKat- Now I'm in a whole new world with you
 
Karb0n-  Unbelievable speeds
         Indescribable systems
         Snagging, trunking, freedialing
         Through an endless microwave sky
         A whole new world
         (DeadKat- Don't you dare hang up the line)
         A hundred thousand things to see
         (DeadKat- Hold your breath- it gets better)
         I'm like a shooting star
         I've come so far
         I can't go back to where I used to be
 
DeadKat- A whole new world
         (Karb0n- Every call a surprise)
         With new networks to pursue
         (Karb0n- Every moment, red-letter)
 
Both   - I'll phreak from anywhere
         When there's time to spare
         Let me share this whole new world with you
 
         A whole new world
         That's where we'll be
     
DeadKat- A thrilling chase
 
Karb0n-  A wondrous place
 
Both   - For you and me
 


The Spirit of Hacking
--- ------ -- -------
(A take off on Rush's The Spirit of Radio) 


Begin the day with a System 75,
An outdial unobtrusive
Plays that dialtone that's so elusive
And the touch-tones make your morning move
 
Off on your way, hit an open trunk,
There is magic at your fingers
For the Spirit ever lingers,
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude.
 
Invisible pulses crackle with life
Bright monitors bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a carrier wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free
 
All this machinery making information
Can still be open-ended.
Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question
Of your honesty, yeah, your honesty.
 
One likes to believe in the freedom of information,
But charging high prices and endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity.
 
For the words of the profits were written on the telco wall,
MaBell's hall
And echoes with the sounds of salesmen.
