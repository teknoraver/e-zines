    "Damn, this guy's puds are getting LaMe as hell..."
                                      -Typical Pudidian.

ş AR-Kansas.

    Once and for all I would like to point out it can't be pronounced ark-an
    -saw. They just fucking took Kansas and slapped a damn AR in front of it.
    HOW I ASK YOU does that get away with breakin' every damn law of nature?
    It should be AR-KANSAS. If I slapped AR in front of everything and 
    changed it life would just be fucking great. So from now on, refer to me
    as arb-afo-meqqqt.
    
ş qqq

    The triple "q" is silent in english. Use it. Use it often.
    
ş How do you spell Socks?

	S-O-Triple Q-C-K-S. Your welcome.

ş You want a love to last forever?

    So what's new. The only type of conformity I can ever see myself giving in
    to would be that bastard love. Love is complex, because it usually starts
    with strange, often wierd emotions, like lust, hatred, and animosity. But
    from there it can go in so many different directions it's pathetic. There
    have been times, late on weekends, when I have told of my love for certain
    females, that haunt me to this day. And yes weather girl was just a phase,
    as has been every girl [Footnote: I had started to type woman but then I
    realized that all the females in my life have been mere girls, pretty sad
    for an individual of over 3200 years in age, but then again, let's just
    say the jungle-jim is a really swinging place.] in my life. The only one
    who I really cared about, trashed my hopes and desires so bad it's just
    pathetic...but hey that's life. Thanks for taking the time to read this
    drivel, think you wasted almost a minute of your life on my problems...ha.
    
ş Sleep.

    Is a concept shoved into your head from the time you are born. You don't
    need but 40 hours sleep a week. Stay up every day. Sleep entirely through
    Sunday. Life will be good. I swear.
    
ş Shit.

    Is what I have written lately. Rambling, etc... Why? Well let's just say
    I am very disappointed in myself. Sometimes you know that you are your own
    master and that no emotion can conquer you, then one does. Damn I feel
    sad...so is this what a TradeWars player feels like?
    
ş Why you don't exist.

    Play along.
    Time doesn't exist.
    Without time there is no speed.
    No speed no movement.
    No movement, no distance.
    No distance equals no area.
    No area, well then no mass.
    No mass? No energy.
    No energy, no universe.
    No you.
    Wow.
    
ş With a little hate...

    We can rid the world of people. It can be quite rewarding to see people
    whom you have always despised rot. Not in death, but in something much,
    much worse. A lousy, boring life. You know the people who you grew up 
    with who seemed to have such a wonderfull life. Now they don't. Working
    at some shit, dead-end job. Knowing that they will never go anywhere.
    Knowing that thier one goal in life is to have every television channel.
    To have a ford. A sad house. A kid or two. Live in ignorance. As far as I 
    am concerned you only live once. Go enjoy it. Have fun. Damn it.
    
ş People who say, "Grow up..."

    Tell them to fuck off... They are just jealous because they no longer live
    in life. They are just here taking up space and wasting resources being 
    nothing more than crap on the face of this once majestic world. Laugh at
    them. Smile. Sing them a song. Act however in the fuck you want. It is not
    anyone's place to tell you how to live, be yourself, do what you think is
    best for you, have fun. Live for once. As a matter of fact, turn of your
    damn computer and go out in the street, yard, etc... and play. I don't 
    care what. Just do it.
