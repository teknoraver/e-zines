      This issue is for those of you who could not understand the charm of
   PUD issue number 4. The article written by NO COURiER, SuB LaMeR 
   eXtReMe. He is the epitome of all bad modem users, in other words a 
   really swell and likable guy. If you didn't understand issue 4 well, gee
   that's just too damn bad now isn't it. When you get back from buying a
   fucking brain we shall continue.

   the more fun you have the better you are in life. A happy person is much, 
   much enjoyable of a conversationalist than a really boring person. Boring 
   people suck, almost as much as VBBS.

End of the lame ass madness.

˛ Free of that hell!

      Sorry about the previous madness but it overcame me when listening to
   heavy metal music, sideways. Listening to music sideways is difficult as
   it takes musical ear, as well as the nack for bieng a stuck-up prude who
   has nothing better to do in life than harass young people's tastes.

˛ Ren and Stimpy.

      I hope they rot in hell. The suck. Bad. Almost as much as the present
   federal goverment does.

˛ G˝ is out.

      And if you don't know what it is. I won't tell you. But I will give 
   you a hint, it is the extension of the PS-MPC. Or as P/C put it, it is
   a new product from the ground up. It features quick replace data files
   to make upgrades quick, easy and efficent. It also can use the same config
   file as the PS-MPC did. Ok I will tell you, it generates ASM code for 
   virii. It does not however include any harmfull or damaging code as they
   expect you to figure this out for yourself. Maybe you will. I doubt it.

˛ Closing.

      This file was lame. I suck. But so do you.
