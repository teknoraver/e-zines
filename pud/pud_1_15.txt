€        ACK! You quote and rip off Yes songs but you do not           €
€   attribute them to Yes. How could you do this??? Your appalling     €
€   lack of journalistic integrity has me puking my virtual guts out.  €
€   Your lame ass attempt at a new issue should never have been        €
€   released. What...Just WHAT were you thinking? You could have       €
€   explored how lamer speak is spreading to fast food restaurants!    €
€   Yes, I have seen it, lamers are taking over fast food. I could     €
€   have d1n3d at the store of my choice if I felt like it. I was      €
€   mortified to see that the deadly lamer diesease had taken over     €
€   the people who wrote up the signs. No, you don't cover this        €
€   IMPORTANT even at all. I can't help but think that perhaps YOU     €
€   are a lamer, who is helping to spread lameness with PUD. Orange    €

€      ACK! You suck Acoutic One, I shall hereby thrash the hell out   €
€   of your message. You LaMeR. First of all I did not Qoute Yes they  €
€   stole that from me! Yes when I was but fragments of DNA I wrote    €
€   that damn song, but unknown to most people, DNA patterns are not   €
€   granted rights by the Constitution. Fast food and Lamer Speak. Did €
€   I ask you? The next time you could d1n3d at the store of your      €
€   choice I would advise you do it. And OPK kick our ass? I doubt it, €
€   why? Because PUD's world headqaurtes[LaMeR SpEaK] is located in    €
€   rural Peru, conversationaly[LaMeR SpEaK] the llama capital of the  €

€        Goosey don't get so riled up, Baphomet is just trying to      €
€   get you angry. Of course we all know that Baphomet really and      €

€   Satan's Mutt in all honesty. Baphomet is just ripping him  off     €

€ ˛ Why PUD is the greatest.                                           €
€                                                                      €						   
€      Because I said so. First off how many cheap rip-off of PUD have €
€   you seen? Well the first one that comes to mind, is VUD. Of course €
€   this is the virtual underground digest. it doesn't really exist    €
€   but has an exact duplicate of PUD's format. Continuity. What other €
€   really K-RaD TFiLE has such great continuity from one issue to     €
€   another? Now I know you are saying, The Dead Sea Scrolls, but no   €
€   not even the dead sea scrolls are as smooth flowing. Did I mention €
€   because I said so?                                                 €
€                                                                      €

€      Why? This is a question I often ask myself. But when I sell     €
€   that oven for a cool 10-spot it makes it all worthwhile. Now I     €
€   understand than many failed miserably when they tried to implement €
€   my first plan in an earlier PUD issue. Therfore I shall make this  €
€   article better for all.                                            €
€      The setup. Just like in toaster thievary, toaster ovens are not €
€   not just a five-minute bang-em-up job. It requires great planning  €
€   on the part of the thief. Firsy you must decide what store you are €
€   going to hit, then you acquire weapons. Lots of them. I myself     €
€   have found that the average hand-grenade is perfect for the know   €
€   it all 17 year old stock boy. It may take two for the Cashiers.    €
€      The Job. After staking out the place of attack for oh a week or €
€   two you should have detailed maps and everybodies schedules at the €
€   store memorized. Now you are ready to hit the joint. Now load your €
€   weapons and fire up your get away vehicle because it's stealing    €
€   time. Go in find an attractive toaster oven. One with the WARM-UP  €
€   feature, perfect for PoP TartS. Make sure that is also has at      €
€   least a one year warranty. Why? Just in case you decided to keep   €
€   it. I am sure you can figure out how to get it out of the store.   €
€   If not, then what are you reading this k_rAD c00ol EliTE tFiLE fer €
€   ya lameR?                                                          €
€      The wealth. Now comes the fun part, the sell. No use in keep-   €
€   ing that toaster oven around when you can fence it and make some   €
€   serious MuLaH. The c00l, k_rAd Thing about toaster ovens, is that  €
€   they are actually very easy to sell. Just set up a yard sell and   €
€   uze has got it made. And just think you will be 10 bucks richer.   €
€   Repeat this a little and you will be rolling in the dough.         €
€                                                                      €

€                                                                      €
€      No not the candy, but me. When one exists with the incredible   €
€   talents, skills, and attributes such as myself they are divine.    €
€   Now what makes me divine? Is it my knowledge? Me extreme dislike   €
€   for VBBS? No. It is because, I unlike you am like me. Yes that's   €
€   right. I am myself, not you. So you should be like me right? No.   €
€   For then you could never become divine. Being divine, great, the   €
€   best there is, is an attitude. One that you must display at all    €
€   times. One that is nothing more than, you. Be yourself. Simple.    €
€                                                                      €
