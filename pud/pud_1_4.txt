  Welcome to the long-awaited PuD Issue  #00000004.00000.  There has been many
compliments and suggestions, most of which pertaining to my brilliance, here
at PuD.  I would like to thank you all for submitting your praise and good
work to plagiarize. PuD is based on only a few things, such as random bashing
and satire of the highly respected T/FiLE groups.  PuD is not based on such lame
things as continuity, standards, and updates on the H0TTeST NeW WaReZ.  If you
choose not to read further because you don't agree to this, or you have to go
wack off over getting another `underground' T/FiLE, go right ahead.

                       "I'm a lamer too"

Hark!
What is that scent that so finely protrudes the realm of great soul?
The one that so lets me rest the peace in the war, the battle in my head.
There is no reason for this.
The gulls are crying, and we are to blame thee.
There for one is the one that I won, the one that to be two too must bow to the
  courtsy of which has remained for the years after all was destroyed.
For the years have been gone and they dwindle no longer.
The one to see has won what is there.
May the fleas of a thousand camels infest thou's armpits.
I am a lamer.

That took me 45 seconds to type.  I originally used absolutely no punctuation or
capital letters.  I simply went back later and corrected it.  Pretty swass.

ş We'RE HeRE N0W.

  Welcome to the show, you masturbating pre-pubescent CUD/PHRACK-reading geeks!
Have fun, and take this as seriously as possible.  I wouldn't want you not to
hold something against me.
  We'RE HeRE N0W, losers.  It is time that those who thought T/FiLES were all
the same recognize the difference.  We'RE HERE, and we AiN'T LEAViNG.
  Get a life you FUCKING LOSERS.  Go find a date with some $20.00 whore instead
of reading this.......  or having mommy read it to you.

ş CHiCKEN N0000DLe SURPRiSE

  Ahh...  a fine gourmet recipe from your friends at Pud.

   Ingredients:

1 Can)   Standard Size Can of Cambell's CHiCKEN N0000DLE SOuP
1« Cups) Water (That's H2O, you wanna-be terrorist geeks!)
1)       Medium-Sized ball of phlegm
¬ Cup)   Vinegar, or douche

   Directions:

  Follow directions to making normal CHiCKEN N000DLE SOuP on label of soup can.
Let simmer for 5 extra minutes, slowly stirring in vinegar.  Remove from range.
  Pour in to bowl, and top with phlegm covered with a parsley leaf.  Serve
covered, yelling "SURPRiSE" as they uncover the bowl.  Shove their face in to
the H0T soup and hold until kicking stops.

 I don't care what you killed.  Go ahead and kill your Bungalow.  You loser,
it's just too bad Buffalo Bill was already taken, huh?  Too bad Speedy the
