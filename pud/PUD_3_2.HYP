  Well, I personally have not been working as dilligently on PuD as I
should be. I don't really think Baphomet has been, either.  However,
other things happen which all should know of because
  "~Ignorance is not innocence, but sin.~"
  Anyway, apart from one Maximus sysop's fit of dumbass which will be
mentioned later, there have been neat new things brewing up in N. Al.
No, really.  Every now and then something interesting happens here.

  Yhea, it sounds interesting.  I, as well as Baphomet <I assume> have
been invited to participate in a local-based newsletter which is
dedicated to objective reviewing and concluding of local BBS's.  Novel
idea?  No, but somehow this has caught my interest, and I have a lot
of neat ideas. Believe it or not, I can write objectively quite well;
I just choose not to when I don't want to.

  Earlier this week, there was a small riot which has been attributed
to by police the occurance of a basketball hoop being torn down.  The
hoop was located at Custom Audio, and was built to keep all of the
"I-don't-feel-like-solderin'-cuz-my-back-hurts" vermin busy.
  It has been said that the hoop was indeed very dangerous, as were
the matches performed at the shop.  A record 1203 serious lacerations
had been recorded in the last week since the hoop was constructed.

WildCat Flaming INCLUDE statements
.TOPIC:WildCat Flaming
.WINDOW:0,7,5,0,8,0,1,1,72,20

  Recently, I was fortunate enough to get involved in an argument of
personal matters with a local Maximus sysop on a Wildcat board.  I
just figured I would mention this, because the outcome is sort of
amusing.
  All of this took place on the ByteSwap, which is the board where all
of Decatur just sort of sits around and waits for somebody else to
upload. When there's nowhere else to call, you call ByteSwap.  When
there's somewhere else to call, you call there first and then call
ByteSwap.
  Anyway, there was this one BBS I used to call sort of often, because
there was nothing much better to do.  Suddenly one day, my life took a
drastic turn and I up and stopped calling all together <I woke up>.
It seems as though the sysop must of been upset by this, because he had
pretty much lost contact with whatever it was he was trying to
accomplish.  Apart from this, I can conclude also that he was put up to
some flaming by his VBBS friends, because flaming over my stopping of
calling his board would be just TOO sad.
  It all started in the flaming sub, where I had months before left
with the false idea that it would come back to what it used to be. He
pitched his fits there for a little while, but he soon saw how I
wasn't really participating. I tried to end the flame immediately,
explaining my decision to leave, on a real-name basis.  I guess that
hurt his petty feelings.
  Soon enough, I was confronted in the general sub, and carried on the
flame throughout a couple of messages.  Soon I had had enough, and I
carried the argument back in to the flaming sub and shut him the hell
up on a real-name basis yet again.
  The ending results were sort of like this:

-  The flamer was pushed out of the general conference with his idiocy
-  The flamer was reprimanded by the Co-Sysop
-  The flamer was embarrassed in both subs
-  The flamer scurried away with his tail between his legs

 Don't let this happen to you.  Take these helpful hints in to
consideration when you intend to flame.

 1>  ~Know your opponent well~
 2>  ~Never flame without respect or status~
 3>  ~Do not carry a flame on the general subs~
 4>  ~Don't count on your prey to be as timid as they seem~
 5>  ~Don't go for the jugular immediately~
 6>  ~Don't think that you are doing anybody a favor~
 7>  ~Never crack on typographical errors~

  Hopefully, these tips will keep me from making any of you fools look
even worse in the furture as easily.  Use them with care.

   Never, EVER flame somebody who has proven themselves as one of the
more aggressive "slammers" on that BBS.

.TOPIC:Never flame without respect or status
.WINDOW:4,0,8,0,9,0,5,5,70,6

  Don't call up some board that you are not very familiar with and
start a flame with one of the higher-calibur users.  You will only
get attacked from all sides.  Also, you will not be taken as
seriously.

.END:Never flame without respect or status
-------------------------------
.TOPIC:Do not carry a flame on the general subs
.WINDOW:4,0,8,0,9,0,5,5,70,5

   On too many BBS's today, there are specified places for
flaming.  Do your dirtywork there.  If the board doesn't have a
flame sub, go somewhere else.

.END:Do not carry a flame on the general subs
-------------------------------
.TOPIC:Don't count on your prey to be as timid as they seem
.WINDOW:4,0,8,0,9,0,5,5,70,6

  The flamer in this particular case had never seen some of the
older stuff.  He was not familiar with what I had done in the
past. Just because the user seems to lay low when you arrive
doesn't mean he can't make you the fool.

.TOPIC:Don't go for the jugular immediately
.WINDOW:4,0,8,0,9,0,5,5,70,6

  Everybody has a weak point; something you can bring up that
will really ruin their day.  However, this should not be the
FIRST thing you address.  The jugular<s> should always be
saved for last, in case of a tailspin.

.END:Don't go for the jugular immediately
-----------------------------
.TOPIC:Don't think that you are doing anybody a favor
.WINDOW:4,0,8,0,9,0,5,5,70,7

  Most all flames are begun by some idiot who pictures
himself as a knight in shining armor, arriving to save all of
the other users from this one terrible person.  Never take
this attitude, for it often proves to be quite the opposite.
  Simply don't expect your reputation to precede you.

.END:Don't think that you are doing anybody a favor
-----------------------------
.TOPIC:Never crack on typographical errors
.WINDOW:4,0,8,0,9,0,5,5,70,6

  Cracking on typographical errors show just how lacking you
are in the "facts" department of your premeditated flame.  It
is quite easy for everybody to tell the difference between
typos and ignorance, so don't dwell on error.
