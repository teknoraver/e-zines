      Goes BOOM! BOOM!. "Rocin' systen d0000ooood," the pathetic little dick
   said to me as I got out the Pumpkin. I looked him up and down, and almost
   automatically knew he was a lamer. I glanced at his shoes. No socks. I 
   glanced towards his head. Shouldn't have, if his mom hadn't cut his hair
   today with the bowl it must have been yesterday. I quickly tried to change
   the subject, "Fuck off you lamer."  He seemed taken aback, unsure of his
   next move. But then he did it pulled the big one. Flashed me. "AAAahhhh!!"
   I cried as I saw his badge. LlAmA PaTrOl. What was a K_rAd d00d to do? I
   spit as only the pure llamuri could. He blocked it instantly with a flash
   of a napkin from his knapsack. I leaped the car, well scrambled over the 
   top. He followed close behind, his eyes glowing with what was obviously
   some cheap movie effect. I darted behind a tree. No good. He found me. I
   had no idea what to do next. And then across the modern desert, the large
   parking lot I saw it. Majestic, proud, shit colored, the one the only, 
   the black llama. Known for it's incredible tear-jerking disney movies I
   knew it had come to save me. Yes, come to save from this lamer, to help
   me escape to a new life of freedom and choice. And then I saw the bus, 
   before I could utter a word it struck the llama. Dead. Blood. Shit. Damn
   was I pissed. But I had forgotten about the lamer behind me. He hit me.
   I laughed. He pulled a gun. I laughed. He shot me. I died. Fuck.

      Hello you it's you again.  Just keep thinking it's your fault...
   
ş Jello. Man's best friend.

      I know you've seen it in the stores. But were unsure if what to do if
   anything	if you purchased it. So I will tell you. Not only is jello, nice
   and nutrititious, but it can also be fun and exciting. How? Well I thought
   I knew and then I started to write this god-damn dribble...damn...I suck.
   Oh well nevermind...it was a topic better left to my own personal inside
   jokes anyway. So fuck off.

      Well dos 6.0 is about to come out. In fact many, of you have probably
   already played with it. My opinion? Like you didn't know, IT SUCKS. I mean
   MoneySoft has really out done themselves this time, including WINdoze crap.
   If they were pushing windoze any harder you think they would just have it
   built into the fucking proccessor. I hate windows. It just isn't good. In
   fact I rather think it is a shoddy piece of work. I bet some geek with a
   quickbasic compiler could write something better...nah what was I thinking?
