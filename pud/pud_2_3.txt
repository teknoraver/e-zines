 ş The art of FD leeching.

      Little known to most it is possible to leech files on boards running
   Front Door rather easily. All you need it a com program like Ultimate
   Terminal. Just, and this is the simple part, go in and REQUEST FILES to
   download. On some boards, especially lAmEr WaReZ b0ards they have their
   FD's setup to allow file request. If they run vision-x just request 
   something like \VISION-X\*.* or \WC30\*.*. That way you can dl their BBS
   and call back and log in as sysop to help them make the board a better
   place. They will thank you for it.

 ş Ode to Mooga the Whale #1.
 
      Across the sea the sky will bow,
      For upon the sun, there was a scowl.
      And then fred in all his fury,
      Bought a whale huntin' ship named the drunk blurry.
      He and some freinds who didn't have theme fruit,
      Set out to sail while they fucked Susan with a boot.
      
	  Oh mooga, mooga
	  how fine you are.
	  I'd like to spear you in the side,
	  your a damn superstar.
	  
      And then in the jungle far away,
      A man named Steve had more smack to say.
      He made a group called TNT anyway.
      And then suddenly, across the bay.
      He saw a ship far away.
      
      Oh mooga, mooga
      how fine you are.
      I'd like to turn you on a spit,
      your a damn superstar.
      
      And so this ship met up with steve,
      and although the army had passed a general reprieve,
      Fred killed Steve.
      
      Oh mooga, mooga 
      how fine you are.
      I'd like to eat your tale,
      Your a damn superstar.
