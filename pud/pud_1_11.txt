€      The krystal is by far the strangest life form on this planet.   €
€   Known to most people, the krystal, called sliders in the wild, are €
€   the most ferocious and vile mammals to roam the sewers of Beverly  €
€   Hills (90210). They are also quite common in the heights section   €
€   of melrose place and by 1996 they are expected to graduate into    €
€   the most dominant species in all of lower Florida.                 €

€      Note the extreme genetic differences in the two species. The    €
€   more docile Krystal has the chewy chocalety candy shell on top of  €
€   it's brains. Where as the much more aggresive Slider has the chewy €
€   chocalety shell on top of it's brains. Notice, by the extreme      €
€   detail of the cut-away's the differences in the sex organs in the  €
€   two species. See how much more enlarged the ovaries of the Slider  €
€   are than that of the Krystal. Legend has it that on the third      €
€   saturday of every month Sliders for some unknown reason take to    €
€   commiting mass genocide by rudely casting themselves at country    €
€   tour buses full of fat women. Note that this is strangly like that €

€      Theft of toasters can be a very worth while and profitable      €
€   occupation. But be forewarned toaster theft is extremely           €
€   dangerous, what with large of rash of mysterious taster thief      €
€   slayings. These slayings are rumored to be by a one fReD tHe       €
€   tOaStEr iS mInE SmItH. He is currently on the SPA top ten hit      €
€   list and is wanted for questioning in 62 states. Anyway I digress  €
€   let me get back to the TFiLE. To begin with you must make sure     €
€   have a valid and great plan. The planning stage is by far the most €
€   important part of the whole process.                               €
€      Part 1, the plan. Making you plan is the key to your toaster    €
€   thievary success. Make sure you have a place to steal a toaster    €
€   from. Next make sure you have a get-away vehicle, a 747 would be   €
€   suitable. Last make sure you have plent of weapons, machine guns   €
€   are not suitable for toaster thievary, but various anti-aircraft   €
€   weapons will be.                                                   €
€      Part 2, the Execution. Now here is where you kill all your      €
€   accomplises.                                                       €
€      Part 3, Stealing the Toaster. To steal the toaster simply walk  €
€   in, carefully concealing your anti-aircraft weaponry under your    €
€   arm. If anyone notices, kill them instantly, but quitely. The key  €
€   to stealing a good toaster is avoiding ones with flowerdy prints,  €
€   as they are usually cheap and just don't cook your toast right.    €
€   Hide the toaster in the crotch of your pants and walk out the      €
€   store.                                                             €
€      Part 4, The get away. The second you leave the store you must   €
€   quickly turn and destroy it, cover your tracks! Next take any      €
€   suitable vehicle in the parking lot and head for your plane. Be    €
€   sure to destroy all oncoming traffic as you near the airport, no   €
€   use in leaving any witnesses alive. When at the airport pick 3 or  €
€   4 attractive stewardesses and maim them seriously. Why? Just for   €
€   fun of it. Now board your plane and fly away. The end.             €
