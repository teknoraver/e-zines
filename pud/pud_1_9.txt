 €      Note that the ingrediants for this recipe can be hard to find   €
 €   especially if one does not reside in the AndÇs. So to make this a  €
 €   more 'global' recipe I have included a substition chart. llama=    €
 €   dead or mangled[Maybe even slighty alive] old people. Now on with  €
 €   the recipe!                                                        €

 €      Ok to start out, sautÇ the llama over a deep fiery pit for no   €
 €      more than 32.4 minutes. Note that ethnic sacrifices add variety €
 €      and spice to your overall product. After removing the whole     €
 €      llama from the pit. Cut it into 13 equal pieces. Then slowly    €
 €      trim all fat from each piece taking great care to leave no      €
 €      bones showing. When done with all 13 pieces, throw them away.   €
 €      Pick up the phone call Domino's you cheap fuck and order a      €
 €      pizza. When the little geeky guy comes have some one from the   €
 €      house either dump the mix from the roof on to the spaz or stuff €
 €      the mix into the tail pipe of his sad-ass car.                  €
 €                                                                      €

 €      Ok so you want to be a really c00l wArEz d00d hUh? How you ask  €
 €   does one become such a wretched reject of society that I have      €
 €   nothing better to do than go out and get WaReZ? Well I will tell   €
 €   you, now pay attention it is really difficult. First of all lose   €
 €   all personality you have ever had. Pick a really lame alias, oh    €
 €   like NO COURiER. Then get a real modem. Well it doesn't have to be €
 €   a good one it just needs to be 14.4k! VroooooooooOOOOMMMMM!!! Yeh, €
 €   whatever. Now comes the most difficult part the typing. Typing     €
 €   like a wArEz d00d takes skill, and dedication. First of ALL        €
 €   vowels must be in LOWERcase, o's of course become 0. And spelling? €
 €   well real WaReZ dUdEs don't spell by normal means, they spell      €
 €   however the can as long as thier is a lot of extended ascii in it. €
 €   WaReZ. You don't need 'em. All real WaReZ dudes is get them and    €
 €   then upload them somewhere else, Joy! I quit this section now.     €

 €        By fReD tHe HiTmAn, a really swell guy. This has all the      €
 €        normal features of Edlin but also features an extended        €
 €        command interface that will please even the most powefull     €
 €        user! Take for example, <SPACE> in normal edlin does a        €
 €        space but in EP it does del *.* and if under 4Dos it does     €
 €        del *.* /y/q. Space is of course replaced by ALT-235, X.      €
