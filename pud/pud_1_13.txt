€ ˛ Purpose.                                                           €
€                                                                      €
€      Yet again I have wondered what my purpose is. It I do not know. €
€   And to tell you the truth I could really care less. But I know     €
€   what I was not created by a union of dna for. Pleasing others. I   €
€   don't mean being nice, or congenial. I mean people who live thier  €
€   lives with but one goal, to please everyone else, to be just like  €
€   everyone else, to have no self determination. I have often thought €
€   of what must drive someone to such a murky view of themselves. To  €
€   tell you the truth I can think of none. Why? Why does someone want €
€   to be like someone else? To gain thier fake loyalty and friend-    €
€   ship? Think of it this way, if you are just like them and they     €
€   like you, they aren't seeing you, they are merely looking in a sad €
€   attempt at a mirror. Is that what you want? To conform. To give in €
€   to this useless echlon of humanity known as peer pressure? If so   €
€   then please stop reading this now. We have no use for the single   €
€   minded or closed individuals here.                                 €
€      If you are still reading, which I am sure you are regardless    €
€   then I would personally like to thank you. Thanks? From me? Yes.   €
€   Contrary to popular belief I am not the biggest jerk or asshole to €
€   ever live, NO COURiER is years ahead of me. But why do you act so  €
€   mean? It's not mean it's called different. Try it sometimes, be    €
€   yourself for once, it's fun, believe it or not.                    €
€                                                                      €

€      I am so sick of fake ass CyberCunts that I guess I have to      €
€   compose a little piece telling you exactly what is wrong with the  €
€   whole cyberpunk scene. Cyberspace, different, strange and fresh.   €
€   Not if these bastard have thier way. They are actually practicing  €
€   a crude and malovent form of Discrimination. Unless you dress,     €
€   piss, and do what they do, they shun you. They believe that they   €
€   are the greatest people to ever use a computer. Too bad for them.  €
€   They suck. To put it midly, I would rather get raped by a run-away €
€   deliquent spotted southern cow than be refered to as a god-damn    €
€   'cyberpunk'. They are polluting cyberspace and they deserve to die €
€   for it.                                                            €

€      Time? School? Waste? Same things. If you are one of the few     €
€   indiviuals who like school please reply. I can not believe the     €
€   view taken by our backwards elders. School as we know it, is a     €
€   farce. It is outdated and wastefull. You quit learning in the 9th  €
€   grade maybe earlier maybe later depending on you. But what can be  €
€   done to improve it? Sadly, I personally think it is to late.       €
€                                                                      €

€      I hate them. If I had a bomb, I would kill them. And yes you    €
€   guessed it, I would enjoy it greatly. I would dance naked in the   €
€   street at my joy. I would be happy, content and well, just plain   €
€   joyous. Ahh to dream...                                            €

€      They abound everywhere. But how do you get rid of them? How?    €
€   Well it's not easy. But the best way, not only gets rid of them    €
€   but shatters thier self-confidence as well. You treat them like    €
€   gods, like friends. You answer thier beck and call, just be as     €
€   nice as you possibly can to them. And then stab them in the back.  €
€   Make sure they know it. Laugh at them. Enjoy it.                   €
