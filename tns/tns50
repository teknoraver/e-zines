Issue Number: 50
Release Date: June 3, 1988


                                 $ Final Issue $



Welcome to the final issue of TNS. I know this might come as a shock to some
people (well maybe not) but this is the last issue of TNS. There will never be
a 51st Issue. 50 Issues is plenty and soon I will be leaving the modem world.


(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((


     The main purpose of this issue is just to wrap some things up. I will
be leaving the phreak/hack world after this issue is distributed. I didn't
expect that this newsletter would be so difficult to produce. All of the
typing that I have been forced to do has taken its toll (It takes a long time
to transcribe all of those articles). I have put a lot of time and effort into
TNS and I hope that I made it into a good magazine.

     I have grown tired of all the r0dentz in the phreak/hack world and all
of the pseudo-phreaks and 13-year olds. Most bulletin boards lack serious
discussions and are filled with tons of r0dentz.

     During my time in the phreak/hack world I have gotten away with many
things that I shouldn't have done. It's been fun and I don't regret a thing.
I've learned a lot and have done a lot of hacking and phreaking over the past
4 years. I've enjoyed most of it and will miss many things.


Right now I'd like to just wrap up some things:

 - Cablecast Operator was put on probation for one year and fined. TAU is
still dead though. It lives on in the TRIAD. Black Peter is probably gone by
now too. He's off doing field-phreaking with Lord North.

 - Allnet is increasing its security. There's some rumor that if a carrier is
detected on a line, they will check out the code to see if the use of the code
is authorized.

 - Don't believe that REMOBS ever existed.

 - Oryan QUEST never knew the first thing about hacking.

 - 950s don't have ANI.

 - and John Maxfield is an asshole.

 - The Syndicate Report is probably gone forever. No one knows where the
Sensei is. He's gone.


     Other things:
     -------------

     There will be no more TNS is the future. 50 issues is where it ends. No
one is taking over the magazine. If I do come back into the phreak/hack world
(which would be atleast a year away). I will not revive TNS but would rather
write for some other on-line magazine (whether it be Phrack, TRIAD, or some
other magazine that might pop up in the future). Phrack is actually quite lame
right now. Taran King was supposed to help with Phrack 17 but cancelled those
plans.
     Some good boards in the hack/phreak world are OSUNY, ce, and Ripco International. Those are all fine boards.

     Files:
     ------

     Over the years that I have been in the h/p world I have written several
files besides the 50 issues of TNS. They are as follows:


     - A Payphone List (the longest every assembled)

     - A Boxing Dictionary (with about 25 boxing definitions/functions/etc).

     - A Guide to Diverters (very good/describes everything about them).

     - A Guide to False Carriers (important information on them)

     - The DATA DIRECTORY


Data Directory:

     This was actually three files that I released recently. Originally I
wanted them to go in Phrack but after I contributed them, I heard nothing. So
I decided to release them on my own. They are:

          Computers A-M (Computers from A-M)

          Computers N-Z (Computers from N-Z)

          Carriers


     The carrier list is the longest list of carriers EVER assembled. It is
extremely long and will delight any true hacker. There's plenty there. I'd
think that the carrier list is the best file I've ever written. Most of these
files are floating around. Ripco and P-80 are two places where I know they
both are. Check there first.

     The Data Directory was actually a computer version of my notebooks. Over
the years in phreaking/hacking, I've collected a lot of information that I
have stored in about 3 notebooks and some 5 folders. In addition to this I
have two boxes filled with junk that I've trashed from various central
offices (does anyone trash anymore?).
Most of this stuff will be thrown out soon as I exit the phreak/hack world.
I don't even plan on keeping the 2600 Magazine issues. I've decided to throw
away all of it except maybe a notebook or two that is dear to me. The Data
Directory is a large part of my notebooks (those files took me over seven
hours to write dammit!!).


     $PCP$
     -----

     PCP was just the title under which I wrote my files. It stands for Pirate
Communications Productions. It means nothing significant.


     My computer will be gone within the next month and, as stated earlier,
the earliest that I would return to the modem world will be in a year. I'll
call around and see what's happening (I'm sure P-80 will STILL be up). As for
now, sysops should remove all my accounts from all bulletin boards that I am
on. I'd say I'm on about 8 different boards.


     That's all I have to say now. With this issue completed I am now leaving
the phreak/hack world... so....
