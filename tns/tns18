Issue Number: 18
Release Date: December 26, 1987



Welcome to Issue 18. The issues seem to be coming out at about four a month,
but I expect things to calm down after a while. Many things are happening so
I thought I should just catch up on some events in the phreak/hack world.
This issue will deal with a number of things in the phreak/hack world. I'll
try to just print some news on the phreak/hack world in this issue.

I'd like to take the time right now to say to everyone:



                               HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
                               ===== =========


             Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year    -Hugo

2600 Magazine's Official Bulletin Boards:


2600 Magazine now has two official bulletin boards. They are OSUNY and
The Central Office. Here is the bulletin contained in the November, 1987
issue of 2600 Magazine:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


     "We now have several ways of staying in touch with the rest of the
world. As promised, the first official bulletin boards of 2600 Magazine are
online with more on the way."
     "We're quite happy with what we've started out with. The two boards are
both in area code 914, just north of New York City. Board #1 is the
legendary OSUNY, a BBS that has been talking about phone phreaking and
computer hacking for longer than any other board that we can remember.
In fact, OSUNY is mentioned on the very first page of our very first issue.
And it's also been referred to in Newsweek, although not very accurately.
Board #2 is the Central Office, another well known bulletin board for hackers
and phreaks. We're proud to be affiliated with these boards and we'd like
to ask anyone else interested in running a 2600 board to log onto these
first so you can see what a 2600 board is all about."
     "As we've stated previously, these boards are completely open to whoever
calls in. No area is off limits or for 'elite' users only. There are no areas
of the systems where credit card numbers, MCI codes, or passwords are
being posted. But we refuse to put restrictions on users' private mail.
Above all else, private mail must remain private. Even the system operator
has no idea what is in each user's private mailbox- that's the only fair
way to run a system. Of course, it's quite possible that someone will send
a Sprint code to someone else through the mail. Or an obscene word. Or a
poem. We do not take responsibility for the contents of private mail. And
neither does the post o similar in format. there are a series of rooms
to 'GOTO:'. Some of them are obvious, some may take a little guesswork.
You can choose the rooms you want to be part of or even create rooms. Entry
is not restricted or monitored, but you do have to know the name of the room
you're entering. (This is not hard information to come by, either through
guessing or asking around.) Files are also stored in some of the rooms.
These are easy to look at and download."
     "There is plenty of online help availiable to users. and should you run
into a problem of any sort, simply leave feedback or call us at (516)
751-2600. Every 2600 board will have an area for users to leave us public
feedback. Both of these boards have a 2600 room. You can use this feature to
communicate with other subscribers, offer criticism, praise, and
suggestions. Of course, you can also do this privately by sending us mail."
     "These systems are completely free to use and full of information and
interesting users. The number for OSUNY, 2600 Board #1 is 914-725-4060.
The Central Office, 2600 Board #2 is reachable at 914-234-3260. If you get
a busy signal, just keep trying. Unfortunately, the 914 area code is not
yet reachable on PC Pursuit, the service offered by US Sprint that
allows unlimited computer time across the country for $25 a month. Let them
know you want the 914 area code added- their number is 800-835-3638 -so we
can all save on phone bills. And keep checking for future 2600 bulletin
boards in other areas."
     "While we're on the subject of bulletin boards, we should point out
that the old Private Sector phone number in New Jersey is no longer in
use. It's possible we may have sent out some information to new subscribers
with that number. If you received such propaganda, please disregard it."


                                       ***


     "In addition to all this, we now have an address on the infamous
'worldnet' discussed in the September 1987 issue of 2600. If you know how
to maneuver your way around the networks, you can send mail to use at our
Usenet address of 2600@dasys1.UUCP or our Arpanet address of
phri!dasys1!2600@nyu. If you have difficulty sending to us at these
addresses, let us know."

Well, there you have it. Once more:


                 OSUNY............(914) 725-4060

                 Central Office...(914) 234-3260


     The Private Sector (201) was previously the official bulletin board
of 2600 Magazine. Unfortunately, the Private Sector ran into legal problems.
It was planned to be put back up recently (with a new format) but nothing
ever became of that. As stated in the bulletin from the November issue of
2600, please disregard anything about the number to the old Private Sector
since the number is no longer in use.


     While I'm on the subject of 2600 Magazine, it will now be going into
its fifth year of publication. For information on 2600 Magazine:


                           2600
                           PO Box 752
            Middle Island, NY 11953 U.S.A.
                           (516) 751-2600

It seems like everyone now has a Voice Mailbox. Why these are so popular I
don't know.

Along with these Voice Mailboxes are a number of infolines full of codes and
other information. I've even seen a few on-line infolines. They're usually
full of information so if you see one posted somewhere, you might consider
calling it.

New Editorship at Phrack!
<><><><><><><><><><><><><>


Phrack Inc. Has had a number of major changes in editorship. According to
Phrack 15:


"Phrack Inc. is now in the hands of Sir Francis Drake, Elric Of Imrryr, and Shooting Shark."


The above statement was from Knight Lightning. With Taran King and Knight
Lightning in college, control of Phrack is in the hands of SFD, Elric Of
Imrryr, and Shooting Shark. These new editors are not new to the hacking
world and I'm sure most phreaks/hackers in the modem world are familiar with
their handles.

The new editors of Phrack have released two issues so far. The issues are
#15 and #16 and contain the following files:

Syndicate Report: Will it Return?
---------------------------------

The Sensei of The Syndicate Report was busted a while ago for various computer
crimes. The question has arisen: Will TSR return?

Here's the story of his bust from The Syndicate Report #16:


 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -



      "That's right, the TSR Editor in the title definately does symbolize
me...The Sensei.  It's not a very glamorous visit, but here's the story:  It
was Wednesday the 14th of this month in October.  Just after school....I logged
into my local VMS Boxes (8504/8503 etc) to check messages.  After logging in,
I was suprised to hear I had no new messages.  I usually averaged 4 new
messages during the day.  Well, I hang up and set up the terminal prog to call
a few systems.  Just as I pick up the phone, my older brother yells to me that
someone was here to visit me about my computer.  Well, you can imagine what I
thought.  I went through the routine of hiding a few disks and files.  I then
walk upstairs to be greeted by an Official from The Connection (a local VMS/
411 psuedo-service.), and an Agent."


     "They were really nice to me at first.  They came up to shake my hand and
tell me politely I was on the edge of serving time for Edina Minnesota police.
Up to 90 days, or 700.00$ fine could be brought down on my under Criminal
Code Statue 609.89 of COMPUTER THEFT.  They said they could have tooken all
the phones in the house and my computer.  I couldn't really understand at first
why they had the right to take my computer.  But I thought to myself, this is
the government...they do as they usually wish to an extent.  But I also
remembered I used the Connection VMS to transfer my Syndicate Report and other
files I made via computer.  They had no warrant, but I wanted to be as
well cooperated as possible, thus to not make the situation a big fuss.  They
asked to see the computer system I had...I showed them gladly since I knew
there was no problem in that direction.  They also told me right off the bat
that if I was 18, I'd be in jail etc.  I was glad for that law.   But they also
pointed out about some 9 kids (under aged) got busted very recently for carding
a load of items and sending them t/ a house - the Judge sentenced them as
adults.  The Judge went on bases that if they kids knew how to do all that,
then they will be tried as adults.  Getting back, they then showed me Syndicate
Report #14 to me.  (Nice prinout may I add)  This was the month for Report
#15 Parts 1 and 2, but I hadn't gotten around to posting it on the VMS line."

      "After a while of BSing on such topics as:  Why do I Hack, write TSR,
scan systems and commit other related deeds.  I only agreed that yeah, I
hacked systems...but only to explore them and learn how they work - Not to
destroy.  Well, they then prompted me that the Secret Service had some of my
Reports and they didn't want to get involved to much."


 - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The quoted material all comes from The Syndicate Report #16.

It does seem likely that The Sensei will be producing The Syndicate Report
despite his arrest. The reference to the 9 kids who were busted for carding
might refer to an earlier incident in Pittsburg........I think.


Sysops shouldn't remove The Sensei's accounts on any BBS's.

2600 Magazine was recently mentioned in PC Magazine by writer John Dvorak.
The article was pro-2600 Magazine and writer John Dvorak wrote that he liked
the magazine.

The LOD/H Technical Journal #3 is due to be released very soon if not already
released by this time.

It is suspected that a hacker/rodent named Agent X is being SUED by Martin
Telecom (or whatever) for $1,000,000. He ran a bulletin board which had codes
posted regularly. The board, known as Hackers Heaven (312), was promptly
disconnected. Of course this isn't the first time that a hacker has been
sued. Allnet Communications Inc. has done this on several occasions and
Sprint set the record for a suit of $20,000,000 (20 Million) against a
so-called "ring" of code-sellers.

It is believed that this individual is being blamed for all losses on every
code posted on his BBS.

Note: not all of this is confirmed since this person cannot be reached.

If this is an incorrect assumption, then I apoligize to Agent X.. even
though several sources have verified this.

weeks.
