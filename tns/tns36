TITLE: Is Your Computer Infected?
FROM: Newsweek
DATE: February 1, 1988


Systems fall to silent- and contagious - killers


     Last fall nurses at an Eastern medical center noticed an alarming
problem- patients' records were mysteriously disappearing from the
hospital's computer system. After several weeks experts found the
culprit: a small, maliciouls program known as a computer "virus" had been
injected into the system where it proceeded to destory nearly 40 percent
of the records. The person who apparently had planted it left his name
and phone numbers (in Pakistan) with a message embedded in the software:
"Beware of this virus, contact us for vaccination." Though they haven't
nabbed the culprit, officials stopped the destruction, but computers at a
nearby university remain infected.
     Computer viruses are silent killers. Usually there are no obvious
signs of infection until the damage has already been done. Hence some are known
as "Trojan horses," while "logic bombs" come equipped with long fuses. The
viruses are highly contagious. They can travel unnoticed though the electronic
networks that link machines. They can also spread every time a contaminated
floppy disc is loaded; the virus will remain in the machine's memory (as long
as the power is on) and will damage other discs that are inserted. As a
result, computer with many users, such as dealer demonstration machines, are
especially prone to trouble. "In a matter of minutes, an entire system can
be infected," says security expert Robert Courtney.
     Like other social disease, these viruses cut across all classes. Just
before Christmas, a virus attacked IBM's worldwide electronic-message
network. The program sent a holiday greetings to computer users and then
passed the same message to everyone on that person's mail-distribution list.
In a matter of hours, the massive electronic chain letter overloaded the
network. A different virus recently hit the University of Bethelhem, Pa.,
destroying data on students' computer diskettes. Another, spread by floppy
discs, has plagued some owners of Amiga computers. There are also rumors that
IRS computers have been attacked, though officials insist those rumors
are unfounded. "We've known about viruses for over 10 years, but we've
just started to really see them in action," says Donn Parker, a computer-security expert at SRI International
in Menlo Park, Calif.

     Immune System:

Scientists worry that viruses could cripple a c
control computers. Building up their immune systems will be costly. "It will
require major changes in operating-system design," says computer security
expert David R. Wilson, of Ernst & Whinney.
     In the meantime, experts are scrambling to cope with the problem.
"We shared information with the IRS, the Department of Defense, the National
Security Agency, the Federal Reserve Bank, the nuclear power industry...
anyone who has enemies," says Eric Hansen, a Minneapolis computer
scientist who wrote the Data Physician, software designed to protect against
viruses. Many fear that the electronic vandalism will only get worse. "It's
like mass murders or freeway shootings," says Peter Neumann, a researcher
at SRI. "You get one and then you get a whole raft of them."

I have to wonder what has happened to this guy. This is the same virus that
has been mentioned in several other magazines with the same message. His
little message helps explain what computers are infected with that same virus.

     "Just before Christmas, a virus attacked IBM's worldwide electronic

This incident has been covered in previous issues of TNS and will be
covered in future issues.

Ahhhh yess... the ever-present quote from Donn Parker. An article on viruses
or hackers just wouldn't be right without a quote from Donn.

One last thing that I would like to note. The writer of the article is
Richard Sandza along with others. Mr. Sandza is well known in the hacking
community for other articles on hacking which I won't mention.

I'm still trying to locate that article in the Houston Chronicle about Jack
the Ripper's bust. Even though I can't get ahold of it... it is established
that Jack the Ripper was busted.

PC Pursuit is taking steps against hackers. They have established an
anti-hacker team to stop intruders from using the system. It is unknown at the
present time how effective it will be. Many people continue to use PC Pursuit
illegally.

The long-distance service known as NTS is cracking down. NTS was a service that
accepted almost anything as a valid code and had codes that lasted for a
long time. Many people have received bills from the service.

There is a new underground magazine. It is:

                 Iron Feather Journal Magazine
                 PO BOX 4035
                 East Lansing, MI

The magazine is said to be similar to TAP and 2600. It deals with subjects
relating to hacking/phreaking/anarchy/carding/etc.

It costs about $1.00 for 3-5 issues (I'm told). I know very little about this
magazine so I suggest that people write first for information.

Golden Hawk called up Allnet claiming that he was writing a paper. He found
out that they are losing about $400,000 a month due to hackers and general
fraud.

Allnet has switched to 7 digits in SOME areas. Some areas also accept both
six and seven digits and are gradually eliminating the six digit codes.

Techninja called up one of his favorite boards and discovered that the sysop
had been nailed for hacking 950s. All of the sysop's equipment was taken
and the sysop was said to be liable for up to $20,000 worth of damage. This
is the third bbs that Techninja has been a member of and has gotten busted.

Bad luck.
