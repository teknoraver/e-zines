Here's an interesting little article that I recently picked up. It is on a
topic that has been going around for quite some time: computer viruses.

          COMPUTER TERROR!



     Some strange things have been happening in the computer community. In
recent months there have been a number of strange deletions of certain computer
programs from around the country. What is causing this: computer viruses.
     Viruses for computers act in much the same way as other viruses. They are
spread by people who trade software and the program containing the viruse is
copied. From there come multiple copies of the virus which spread to other
programs and infect whole collections of software.
     After a certain period of time, the viruses start their work. Programs
disappear from disks. Software starts to malfunction. Many of these viruses
are called "Trojan Horses," due to the fact that they are not apparent upon
observation of the program.
     The cause of these viruses is usually a so-called "hacker" who writes
the virus to wreak havoc in the computer community. These hackers are the same
people who invade computer systems and delete software from the outside.

PROTECTION:

     The only protection from these viruses is to stop trading software with
people you don't know. There are a number of "antidote" programs that are
designed to get rid of viruses in case you are already infected.

          THREE YOUTHS SUSPECTED IN PHONE FRAUD


     by Robert McMillan


     Three California youths have been arrested for allegedly using their
computers to steal thousands of hours of long-distance service from Sprint,
MCI, AT&T, and other common carriers. The youths reportedly used their
computers to dial MCI computers and enter random codes in an attempt to use
MCI services without paying.
     Other long-distance identification codes were received from computer
"bulletin boards" where other illegal information was obtained. Upon examing
several of the bulletin boards, police officials found plans for making bombs,
credit-card account numbers, long-distance identification codes, pornography,
and messages dealing with drugs and terrorism. Most of the bulletin boards
had "phreak" sections where telecommunications fraud was discussed.
     The youths used names such as Dr. Phreak, PhalToxic Waste to hide their real identities.
     The three youths frequently called these bulletin boards to exchange
information with others who were defrauding common carriers. The youths
reportedly stole an estimated $150,000 from Sprint, MCI, AT&T and other common
carriers. All of their computer equipment was seized after their arrest.

TELEPHONE FRAUD INVESTIGATION CALLED THE LARGEST IN US HISTORY


 . (April 27) Authorities have released more names of those arrested this week 
in what now is being called the largest investigation of telephone access fraud
in history. As reported here earlier (GO OLT-476), arrest warrants started 
coming down yesterday in Honolulu, where an eight-month undercover operation by
the US Secret Service was based. The suspects are accused of acquiring 
unauthorized long-distance credit card numbers and access codes, then using and
selling the codes to defraud the phone companies. As part of the sweep, search 
warrants have been executed in New York City, Rome, N.Y., Newark, N.J., 
Chicago, Seattle, Ashland, Ore., Mountain View, Calif., Los Angeles, Murray, 
Utah, Sierra Vista, Ariz., Albuquerque, N.M., Dennison, Texas, Gulf Breeze, 
Fla., Vero Beach, Fla., Jensen Beach, Fla., Provo, Utah and Little Rock, Ark. 
Speaking with Ron Todt of United Press International, federal authorities in 
Honolulu said that in most cases, computer crackers broke into phone company 
systems and stole the access codes. The numbers then were sold to distributors 
who operated through a nationwide network, and eventually to individuals or 
small businesses who bought the codes after they are promised unlimited long 
distance service. US Attorney Dan Bent told Todt that usually the unauthorized 
use was detected within an average'oo three days, and the user would then get a
new code. Bent added that the suppliers had a variety of "ingenious" 
explanations for the need to change codes so often. Steve Ramsay of the Secret 
Service added, "Hundreds of people throughout the country bought these stolen 
access codes belonging to several long-distance carriers for $100 to $150 per 
month for unlimited long-distance service." UPI says the Secret Service 
infiltrated the suppliers' networks last August, putting out the story that 
they would be interested in buying codes. By October, they were in contact with
some suppliers and, as noted yesterday, they received more than 600 such codes.
Says the wire service, "They eventually began selling codes, provided by the 
long-
distance companies who cooperated in the investigation, to cement the 
relationship and track the use of the codes. Authorities said the proliferation
of the codes was 'staggering.' One number was released Dec. 9 and then shut 
down four days later on Dec. 12. ... In just four days, $73,592 worth of 
illicit charges were made on the number." Bent characterized phone fraud as "a 
crime of the future," because "it used sophisticated computer technology to get
off the grountainly used computer technology to investigate the 
crime." He added that the defendants, if convicted, face five years and a 
$250,000 fine on each of the 33 counts. UPI identified those arrested so far 
as: -:- Billie Alexander of Los Angeles. -:- Steven Hayes of Syracuse, N.Y. -:-
Christopher Lowe of Seattle. -:- Alan Inga of Newark, N.J. -:- Renee Bounds of 
Portland, Ore. -:- Robert Danek of Albuquerque, N.M. -:- John Fechser of Salt 
Lake City. -:- John Doe, also known as Alex, of New York. -:- Eileen Avanzino 
of Little Rock, Ark. -:- Clayton Parker of Dallas. -:- Bert Zimmerman of 
Tucson, Ariz. -:- Ann Thompson of Tallahassee, Fla. -:- Jeff Lewis of Chicago. 
-:- Richard Denning of Salt Lake City. -:- Howard Golub, Bill Rosemeyer, Scott 
Mosman and Dieter Thate, all of West Palm Beach, Fla. Authorities also told UPI
that two others were investigated in searches yesterday on 24 warrants.

A bulletin board known as the Black Hole was taken down by authorities in
Boston. Credit-card numbers and codes were frequently posted on the bulletin
board.

Jack the Ripper was busted a while ago. There was an article printed about how
he was busted which I am trying to get. It is unknown if this is the same Jack
the Ripper who is an old-time phreak/hacker from long ago.

There was an article in USA Today about John Maxfield and BoardScan. If I am
able to get it, it will be in a future issue somewhere.

A new group has been formed in the hack/phreak community. It goes by the name
of:

                    The CIA

The initials CIA are said to stand for: The Computer Invasion Association.
This group, $CIA$, is said to be a group of some of the TOP hackers and some
of the top phreaks around. It is very militant and seems to be similar to
LOD/H. The group is private. No member list is availiable since all of the
members are being very discreet about the whole thing to avoid any attempt
by the Secret Service or federal officials to undermine the organization.

They have their own bbs which is only for the group, which is made up of only
8-12 members. They are very elite and little information is availiable on the
group. Not even the name of the bbs on which they meet is known. All of these
precautions are to protect the members.

It is also said that many of the members are not well known or not members
of other groups. They are, however, extremely ELITE and their actions are
very confidential. Their main targets seem to be military computers and
educational computers. They are also targetting systems on Telenet.

We'll be looking for more information on the $CIA$.
