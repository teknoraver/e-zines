Release Date: November 19, 1987



This issue will continue from where it left off in issue #10. Issue #10
detailed the bust of Shadow Hawk. This issue will now continue with more
details and explanations of Shadow Hawk's bust.



This issue is a continuation of the explanations in issue #10. All of the
quoted material in this section of issue #11 comes from the article printed in
issue #10. What follows the quoted material from the article is an
explanation of that part of the article.


======================================


"a computer break-in at the Bell Labs computer in Naperville was discovered
and a record of the intruder's telephone number was spotted"-

     The computer system at Bell Labs in Naperville, Illinois obviously has
CLID (Calling Line Identification) on the line and it made a record of
Shadow Hawk's call.
     The Bell Labs area at Naperville is a three-building complex near
Naperville and Warrenville Roads. According to a later article in the
Chicago Tribune (the same newspaper that wrote the story of Shadow Hawk's
bust), "Research into this technology of routing is essentially what Bell
Laboratories in Naperville is all about."


======================================


"Illinois Bell then began using a device known as a dial number recorder
to log all calls made from the telephone number"-

     The DNR (Dialed Number Recorder) was placed on Shadow Hawk's line after
his break-in at the Bell Labs computer was detected.


======================================


The computers that the article listed as trying to break into or having
broken into are as follows:


     - Bell Laboratories Facility in Naperville, Illinois

     - NATO Maintenance and Supply Headquarters in Burlington, N.C.

     - Robins Air Force Base in Georgia

     - Washington Post Newspaper (attempted)

     - A hospital in South Bend, Indiana (attempted)

     - various attempts at computers in Columbus, Ohio; Rye, N.Y.; and Pipe
Creek, Texas

This bust was not Shadow Hawk's first. In August of 1986, Shadow Hawk was
busted for hacking into an RSTS/E system. His house was raided and they
confiscated disks and printouts. Here is the post where he describes his
bust. The post comes from Pirate-80 at (304) 744-2253.

Well, you guys are not going to believe this... I got BUSTED... Yep. I dont 
recall whether or not I posted them here, but thn 
the 312-454 exchange... They didn't seem to like myself and others playing 
around in their system... Well, to make a long story short, they really didnt 
get any useful information out of myself (other than printouts of all my scans,
and a dump of a few messages from a local board... nothing serious) Anyway, 2 
days later my modem fried, and now I'm using an INMAC 1200 I picked up for $40 
at a hamfest (but it doesnt work right, shit.) Well anyway, heres some shit: 
See if you guys can hack this unix, I cant do any major hacking for a while-- 
(the cops have some deal with illinois bell now where they can check on all the
#'s I call... gay) 
930-XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-XXXX,XXXX-
XXXX,XXXX-XXXX are all this one unix... I cant hack it at all, its gay. Heres 
a ROLM CBX: 930-XXXX, and an HP-x000: 930-XXXX... this responded with "ESS - 
HIT RETURN TO LOGIN" after I typed a shitload of ctrl-chars, but I cant get it 
to do that anymore--930-XXXX... AC-SAT 11.06 - DB 11.05 - AL 87A will be 
printed if you call 930-XXXX... heres a unix I could get into: 930-XXXX-XXXX, 
login root   login top   login oldsh   login backup    no password for any of 
them. On all xcept backup, check out the file RSTSHELL... interesting... also 
README... try 930-XXXX for a weird experience 310-XXXX is another stubborn unix
310-XXXX login guest (those were all (312) area, sorry!!!) 201-265-XXXX login 
sys 914-945-XXXX login Uback password idontcare    thats the gay uucp login, 
see what you can do with it... I would have more, but, what the fuck, I'M 
BUSTED. Oh yeah, the peoples who's rsts's I ravaged arent gonnapress harges. 
goodie. Don't worry, youre safe, (_>Sh1<_)

P.s. anyone know the # for INMAC?  oh yeah, one more thing, at the hamfest 
where I got the modem, i got a diverter for $10... pulse... oh well, it sucks.







     As you might have noticed, Shadow Hawk remarked how the police had some
sorta deal "with illinois bell now where they can check on all the #'s I call"
which might refer to an earlier DNR that was placed on his line all the way
back in June of 1986. Of course, this isn't the same DNR (Dialed Number
Recorder) that was on his line (which is apparent in the article).
     The numbers listed in the post have been edited out and replaced with
x's. The "xxxx" is actually the suffix (x-ed out).
     The people whose system Shadow Hawk hacked into did not press charges
and nothing really ever happened because of this bust.

     CHICAGO (AP)- Federal investigators are wading through piles of printouts
to assess damage caused by "Shadow Hawk," a teen-age computer buff who
used AT&T systems to tap into NATO and Air Force telephone networks, a
prosecutor said Thursday.
     Secret Service agents who raided the North Side home of the 17-year-old
"hacker" confiscated three computers and software stolen through telephone
company systems, said William J. Cook, an assistant U.S. attorney. He would
not speculate on any motive for the teen-ager, who used "Shadow Hawk" as a
code name, but said some hackers like to see how far they can go with their 
machines.
     A decision on whether to charge the teen-ager will be made after the
stolen materials are analyzed, Cook said. Agents have been working
full-time since the Sept. 4 raid printing out "the enormous quantity of
material stored in his computers," he said.
     National security was not seriously jeopardized by the theft of material
from an AT&T computer at NATO Maintenance and Supply Headquarters in
Burlington, N.C., Cook said. But he declined to comment on the nature of
information taken from Robins Air Force Base in Georgia.
     AT&T put the value of its stolen software, some of which is not yet on
the market, at more than $1 million, Cook said. The teenager also is
suspected of revealing vices over a computer network in
Texas that is used as a kind of bulletin board for hackers, he said.
     The network, called "Phreak Class-2600," exists only "to educate 
computer enthusiasts ... to penetrate  industrial and government sector
computer systems," said Cook. Authorities said they were led to the  teen-ager
partly through messages he left on the Texas network, bragging of having
gained access to the AT&T computer files. Kathryn Clark, a spokeswoman for AT&T,
said the company's security systems were triggered by Shadow Hawk's computer
break-ins. There was no physical  break-in, Cook said. The computer
programs and other information were  obtained by tapping into systems by
telephone, using another computer. Shadow Hawk penetrated AT&T computers 
by disguising his own computer as a  telephone company computer, he 
said.   
     "Once entering the system, he would have his computer talk to the 
phone company computers and cause the  computer at some remote spot to 
transfer files to ... Bell Labs in Naperville," a Chicago suburb, Cook said.
Then the youth would transfer the information in the Bell computer into his
own computer, said the prosecutor. An analysis of long-distance calls made
from the youth's telephone indicates he also tried to enter computers at the
accounts-payable department of The Washington Post and and other
businesses, the prosecutor said.
     A 17-year-old is considered a juvenile, Cook said, and if investigators 
believe charges are warranted, the  Justice Department would be petitioned  for
permission or the case could be turned over to local officials for
prosecution under state law.

NOTA:

This article just explains some more on the bust of Shadow Hawk. The newspaper
put in the details on how Shadow Hawk received the files for the average
reader who would not know of such things. The article gave a little more info
on the raid on Shadow Hawk's house. As stated the the article, the SS (Secret
Service) confiscated three computers along with disks and printed material.
It is likely to assume that they confiscated disks containing hack/phreak
information and the stolen software. Shadow Hawk was known to have hundreds
of K worth of unixes. They most likely also obtained his passwords to all
boards and other such materials. Any further updates on Shadow Hawk's bust
will be noted in later issues of TNS.

TITLE: US Sprint Sues "Ring" of Hackers for $20 Million
FROM: Los Angeles Times
DATE: 


    US Sprint said Friday that it has filed three lawsuits seeking more than
$20 Million for losses from a multistate ring of commputer hackers who
allegedly stole long-distance telephone service using illegally obtained
authorization codes.
 
    The complaints, filed Thursday in U. S. courts in Los Angeles, Seattle and
Kansas City, Mor., are evidence of yet more woes plaguing the fast-growing
long-distance telephone company.
 
    Kaprint, a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United
Telecommunications Inc., has been plagued by thousands of customer-billing
problems that contributed to a $76-million loss in its second quarter and the
departure of the firm's president.
 
    Sprint spokesman Syd Courson said the alleged ring used computer equipment
to identify Sprint long-distance authorization codes, the numbers that
customers dial in some circumstances use the long distance system.
 
    $20 MILLION IN CALLS
 
    Once the ring obtained the codes, Courson said, it placed more than $20
million worth of long-distance calls on the sprint network, with the calls
billed to the parties actuallly assigned the codes. Some of the stolen codes
were sold to business users through elaborate marketing programs, he said.
 
    Defendants named in the lawsuits include: Gyan P. Syal and Karlheinz
Mueller of Los Angeles area;  Paul Lindahl, Ralph Purdy III and Kenneth J.
Sheridan, all of the San Fransisco area, and Frederick M. Deneffe III and
Burton Leroy Andrews of Portland, Ore., area, Sprint said.
 
    The defendants allegedly conducted business under varrious company names,
including United Systems, California Discalland Hello America, the suit
charged. Criminal charges previously were filed against some of the defendants
by federal authorities, Sprint said.
