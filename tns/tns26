TITLE: COMPUTER TERRORISM!
FROM: The Chicago Sun-Times
DATE: January 17, 1988

By Jim Ritter


     Malicious hackers have discovered a new weapns for disabling computers:
an electronic "virus" that bears similarities to the AIDS virus.
     An electronic virus is a set of instruction hidden within a computer
that destroys programs, wipes out data and does other mischief. Worst of all,
it reproduces itself like a biological viruse, and "infects" other computers
it contacts.
     "It might do to computers what AIDS has done to sex," said Shai Bushinsky,
an Israeli computer expert. "The current free flow of information will stop.
Everyone will be careful who they come into contact and with whom they share
their information."
     In Jerusalem, a virus infecting Hebrew University computers threatens to
destroy thousands of electronic files and wipe out years of research. Whoever
introduced it "wanted to wield power over others and didn't care how he did
it," said programmer Yisrael Radan.
     Last November, a virus spread through personal computers at Lehigh
University in Bethlehem, Pa. Several hundred people lost data and programs,
including term papers written on word processors and financial ledgers
prepared for business classes.
     An before Christmas, some grinch infected computers in IBM corporate
offices with a virus that brought the corporation's computer mail network to
a virtual halt for a few hours.
     "The problem has really just surfaced," said Donn Parker, an expert on
computer security for SRI International. "Once one of these things is done,
it's like a break in the dam. Malicious hackers will pick up on the idea and
try to do one better than the next guy."
     Computer viruses are the latest weapons to be used by the disgruntled
employees, irresponsible hackers and teenage "twits" who have been terrorizing
computer users throughout the 1980s.
     The saboteur begins by using a secret code to hide his virus in a
seemingly legitimate program known as a Trojan Horse.
     At first, the virus lays dormant and the unsuspecting user doesn't notice
anything wrong. The program continues to do its intended job, such as word
processing or accounting functions.
     Meanwhile, the virus spreads to programs in other computers. The
affliction can spread quickly because computer users swap programs all the
time. One common method is putand lending it out.
Another popular practice is hooking up to elec-

Weapons of Computer Sabotage


TROJAN HORSE: Program within a program, containing secret instructions. Attacks
unsuspecting user by unleashing sinister activities known as viruses, time
bombs, worms, and salami attacks.


VIRUS: Destroys data or program instructions stored in a computer disc by
writing over it. Reproduces itself so that it can "infect" and destroy other
programs it contacts.


TIME BOMB: Instructions that tell a virus when to attack. It may explode, for
example, on Friday the 13th, or the moment a fired employee's I.D. number is
removed from the payroll records.


WORM: Destroys data as it wriggles through a program. For example, one type
of worm makes thousands of copies of itself, wiping out everything else in
the program's memory.


SALAMI ATTACK: Instructs computer in a financial institution to divert small
ammount of money from thousands of accounts into the user's accout. It's
like stealing thin slices of salami from other people's sausages to make your
own roll.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tronic "bulletin boards," where users swap programs, games, and messages over
telephone lines.
     The virus attacks at a predetermined time. At Hebrew University,
for example, the virus was programmed to do damage every Friday and on the
13th day of each month.
     Not all viruses are destructive. Indeed, one computer game involves a
viruse that reproduces itself within the computer without damaging anything.
The object is to write instructions that search out and destroy the virus.
     The virus that infected IBM's computer mail network may have been
meant more as a prank than a malicious act. The prankster's "letter" was a
drawing of a Christmas tree. It appeared on the screen when the receiver
opened his electronic mail.
     The virus spread rapidly, like a chain letter. It would go to every
colleague on the user's mailing list, and then to every one on his colleagues'
mailing lists. Before long, the network was as jammed as the Dan Ryan at rush
hour. But no permanent damage was done.
     By contrast, a virulent virus is meant to destroy data or progrms stored
in a computer, known as software. Such a virus doesn't harm the computer itself
but the software is more valuable. Unleashing a virus is like destroying an
authors 400 page manuscript but leaving his typewriter alone.
     Viruses can be killed by writing search-and-destroy programs. But
because viruses can do great damage before their detected, it's best not to
contact them in the first place.
     There are several defenses. One example is protective software, such as
the program CHK4BOMB ("check for bomb"). CHK4BOMB screens programs for
suspicious instructions that may contain a virus.
     Users also record backup copies of valuable software on floppy discs. They
should be stored away from the computer where they can't be infected. Perhatant, users should swap programs only with people they trust.
     But none of these measures are foolproof. As with AIDS, the only
completely safe strategy is abstinence: Never trade discs or swap programs on
bulletin boards.
     But computer celibacy isn't likely to catch on, said Curtis Sahakian, a
leading bulletin board operator. The Chicago area alone has at least 100
bulletin boards, some receiving hundreds of calls a day.
     "People will not stop using them," Sahakian said. "Nor will they stop
having sex."

NOTA:

I like the how they compared it with AIDS..... yeah.. right.


Some things to not about the article:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     "malicious hackers"-

Whenever they use the word hacker, they have the work malicious or perhaps
irresponsible in front of it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     "bears similarities to the AIDS virus"-

It's nice that they could compare those things.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     "'The problem has really just surfaced,' said Donn Parker, an expert on
computer security for SRI International. 'Once one of these things is done,
it's like a break in the dam. Malicious hackers will pick up on the idea and
try to do one better than the next guy.'-

I know very little about Donn Parker but I do know that every time there is
some news story about hackers they always consult him. It seems like they
always have a quote from Donn Parker on computer security. You'll notice how he
says "malicious" hackers.

And doesn't everybody want to make the latest K-R/\D virus....d00d??

Hackers aren't trying to create better and better viruses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     "At first, the virus lays dormant and the unsuspecting user doesn't notice
anything wrong."-

Viruses can remain dormant. This is true. One example it the GIMME A COOKIE
virus and the ARF! ARF! GOTCHA virus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     "Computer viruses are the latest weapons to be used by the disgruntled
employees, irresponsible hackers and teenage 'twits' who have been terrorizing
computer users throughout the 1980s."-

Actually computer viruses have been used for quite some time.. all the way
back to the first hackers. Yes there have been some people who have terrorized
computer users... but these people are... what's the word??...twits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE DEFINITIONS:

My favorite definition is the "Salami Attack." Where did they get that one?
hmm.... wasn't there something like that in Superman III or something like
that... Anyway, I've never heard of that one before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     "The virus that infected IBM's computwork may have been
meant more as a prank than a malicious act. The prankster's 'letter' was a
drawing of a Christmas tree. It appeared on the screen when the receiver
opened his electronic mail."-

I might have even heard of this. I know of a case very similar to this where
the electronic mail service was all screwed up. It might be the same case..
I'm not sure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRA NOTES:


Right below the title to the article is a drawing of a computer. On the screen
is some guy holding an M-60 machine gun (some Ramboish guy)...; thereby giving
a picture of the danger of computer terrorism.
