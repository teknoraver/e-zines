%HISTORY OF TNS%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The Tolmes News Service started out as just a series of posts on P-80
Information Systems. It was originally entitled "Hugo World News" (as a satire
of Knight Lightning's "Phrack World News".) The first fifteen or so issues
of TNS are repeats of previously posted articles. NOTICE: The articles in TNS
arezines, news reports, etc. They are being typed out. All of the articles 
listed will also show the date and the magazine/newspaper/etc. in which the 
article first appeared. The file will usually also display the reporter who 
wrote the article for the certain magazine/newspaper/etc. Anything noted as an 
"NOTES ON THE ARTICLE:" is my own opinion of the article. NOTA will also do 
some explaining of the article for persons who did not understand. One other 
thing that NOTA will do is to correct any errors in the article. I hope that 
NOTA will clarify points that were expressed in the article.

At the beginning of every issue (except for a few with only 1 thing) there will
be a short index of what articles are being put in the issue. The index will
show the original title of the article as it appeared in the newspaper/etc.
The index will be followed by a few short notes by yours truly on the state
of affairs in the BBS world and any current events.

Some issues will only have one article within them... while other issues might
have five or six different articles. Remember, TNS just types out articles
from the press that are of interest to the phreak/hacker.

The first few issues will go back a while (not as far as Sandza and all of
that 414 crap). The articles are placed in no specific order.. they're just put
together without any reason......

After the first fifteen or so issues are put out, the next issues will be
out every month or so. This newsletter will not (not yet anyway) print news of
busted phreaks that did not come out of the media. This is to prevent certain
persons from spreading lies and rumors. Certain posts from BBS's will be used 
and other information from BBS's will be used. Articles (that have not been 
written by myself) will not have any comments inserted. Some articles will be 
edited and other articles will have only certain parts used. Information that 
would be of no interest to the reader will be deleted. Useless, false, or 
boring information will be explained afterward in NOTA (Notes On The Article).

This magazine (if you could call it that) might have some interviews,
transcripts of certain television broadcasts, and radio broadcasts in the
form of articles.

Information from outside sources may not always be verified. In all cases
where it can be verified, any information that is false, misleading,
or useless will be edited out/deleted. The information held within cannot be
verified in many instances, but articles will be edited for material
that may be used as propaganda. Anything found (by myself) to be
misleading/bad/false/partially useless will have an explanation in NOTA.

All information is meant for information purposes only. This series
of issues is a NEWS magazine and is not meant to be used for any type of
illegal exploit or stupid shenanigans. Remember, this is NEWS on the 
phreak/hack world. I claim absolutely no responsibility for anything within 
this on-line magazine.
