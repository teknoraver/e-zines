Issue Number: 15-Part II
Release Date: December 20, 1987


     Issue #15-Part II will continue where we left off with part I. All of
Tolmes News Service Issue #15 deals with the Max Headroom TV Pirate who
broke into two broadcasts recently.

     For more information, see TNS Issue #15-Part I.

For those who missed it, here is the summary of what happened as printed
in TNS Issue #15-Part I:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1) On Channel 9 (WGN) in Chicago, the 9 o'clock news was interrupted during the
sports section.

2) For about half a minute, a character in a Max Headroom mask came on the
screen (with a moving background too).

3) Channel 9 (WGN) cancelled out the signal after about half a minute.

4) About 2 hours later, on Channel 11 (PBS) in Chicago, the Max Headroom
TV pirate came on again. This time Max Headroom did a little skit where he
would drink a can of Pepsi and throw it away and other antics. Toward the end
of the skit, the man with the Max Headroom mask dropped his pants, mooned
the screen, and was spanked with a fly swatter. The entire episode took place
while the science-fiction series Dr. Who was being broadcasted. The skit
lasted for about a minute and a half. The pirate stopped the broadcast on
his own (Channel 11 didn't knock it off the air). Since Channel 11 is public,
it didn't really have the power to knock the broadcast off.. so Max
Headroom might have been on for half an hour if he wanted to be. Some words
were heard but most of it was blurred.


TNS Issue #15-Part II will now print some other news broadcasts dealing with
this TV pirate.


This next news report comes from Channel 9 (WGN-TV) in Chicago. As you
will note from the summary and Issue #15-Part I, Channel 9 was one of the
stations that had its transmission broken into.


Anything like this:       *> xxxxxxx <*

is an explanation of what was on the television at the time of the news
broadcast. This is to help represent what was put on the screen as the
report was in progress. Of course, there will be highlights from the Max
Headroom pirate on the tv during the report at certain times.

AN: The Federal Communications Commission tonight is trying to find out
    whose responsible for two acts of video piracy. Last night, someone
    broke into regular programming here on Channel 9 and later at Chicago's
    public broadcasting. As Larry Rhoderick reports, the first interruption
    took place during last night's 9 O'clock News.

                  *> Max Headroom Coming Onto the TV <*


LR: Sports anchor Dan Rollin had just started his Sunday night Bears report
    when the screen suddenly went black. It came back on with a new unruly
    prescense.


                    *> Max Headroom Gyrating <*


LR: ... a man wearing a Max Headroom mask. We had been taken over by a
    video pirate, for a time. Until technicians changed microwave channels
    between the studio and the transmitter and knocked him off the air.

BS: Apparently, somebody with some microwave equipment was able to interfere
    with our signal going to the Hancock transmitter.

LR: Now this is not just anybody off the street. He has to have an electronic
    expertise of some level, right?

BS: Yes he does. It takes very sophisticated equipment to do this at a
    significant power level. So this isn't just something that anybody would
    be able to accomplish.

LR: But Channel 9 wasn't alone in its Max Headroom appearance. There was
    even a longer episode on Channel 11, public broadcasting.


                     *> On Screen: a Dr. Who episode <*


                   *> The Image Starts to Get Cloudy <*


LR: A little after 11 p.m. Dr. Who was knocked out by the Max lookalike, who
    pitched a soft drink....


                   *> Max: Pitching a Pepsi Can <*


LR: .. then performed a series of antics that station officials found less
    than humorous.


                        *> Max: With No Pants On <*


LR: .. before the pirate himself pulled the plug.

AY: Fortunately, it was a self-destruct mechanism. It was beyond our control.
    We have already implemented steps whereby we could take something like
    that off the air immediately if it were to occur again. It did of its own
    volision go off, as I say, after about a minute and a half.

LR: It annoyed some viewers....


                       *> On Screen: Some Strange Woman <*


V1: I don't know.. I thought it would be just a slight messup but THAT in
    the middle of the tape... we're going to have to tape over it.

LR: Angered others....


                        *> On Screen: Some Guy <*


V2: Uhh.. if somebody wants to get attention, WHAT DO THEY DO? They break
    into a television broadcast. Just to get attention. Like throwing a brick
    through your window. So to speak. It'. It's not too bright
    really.

LR: While some thought it was a lot of fun....


                        *> On Screen: A Little Boy <*


V3: vwerry .... vwerrry funny...

LR: It may seem very humorous, but there is more to it than that. For when
    this person is caught, he or she will face both civil and criminal
    penalties.


                 *> Phillip Bradford (from the FCC) <*


PB: It is very serious and we would like to inform anybody who's involved
    in this type of thing that it is serious and we will take every step that
    we can to find out who is doing it. And once we have determined that, we
    will make sure that the full extent of the law is carried out.

LR: Meanwhile, Channel 9 engineers say they have taken steps to prevent
    further appearances of the mock Max. This is Larry Rhoderick, WGN News.

AN: The FCC says last night's piracy was the first of its kind in Chicago.

JD: Federal Communications agents say they don't think what happened to two
    local TV stations here last night is funny. And they've launched an
    investigation to find the so-called video pirate who interrupted
    broadcasting.

JD: A figure resembling Max Headroom suddenly popped up during a WGN

    Channel 11.

JD: Officials believe the pirate used a microwave to interrupt the signal from
    Sears Tower. They're not sure exactly how it was done but they feel
    sure it won't happen again.

AD: I would think that an incident similar to what occured last night
    could not occur again.

RP: Based on what you're doing now to correct it?

AD: Based on what we're doing now, yes.

JD: The stations would not elaborate on what those procedures are.

JD: The FCC reminds any potential pirates that it's against the law and
    they could face stiff penalties.

  => ALL MAX HEADROOM FANS <= 
    
  It seems the hackers ARE rebelling over the recent cancellation of the Max 
Headroom TV show on ABC. Bill the Cat mentioned a story of t
TV ignals on a channel 9, and I know that MTV is offering a "Max headroom 
Hotline" that some hackers took over.  
   
  The number, by the way, is [818]-377-5000. It's a VMS.

This morning of ABC's World News This Morning, there was a story about all the 
broadcast overrides.  We've gotten WGN, WWOR, and the superatation out of 
Kansas, KTAT, I believe.  He said "The FCC is looking into how someone could 
intercept broadcasts".  I've studied this for a long time, and believe me, 
it's not hard.  Especially overriding superstations.  They showed a videotape 
of what was transmitted.  It was Bo A homemade Max Headroom.  It was pretty 
neat.  We'll strike again.  I can guarantee it.

My thoughts on the jamming of the Chicago stations comes down to one  simple 
thought. It takes no massive amounts of power to jam a signal to  any 
reciever. The ability to trace this type of jamming is going to be  very 
difficult since it was a line of sight interception and over-powering  of the 
signal. Now I have a few ideas that would make such actions possible. Think 
about the use of standard microwave ovens with the basic wattage of  300 to 
500 watts. Now inject your standard video / audio signal into this 
 giga-bandwidth of space. Wattage + directed targeting at something that is 
 so open and un-protected allows for all sorts of jamming and over-powering 
 with ease. If you are to think about the way to do something like this then 
 a simple low cost system is for you.  
  Your own "Max Headroom" kit contains:  
          ------------ 1 Amana Radarange 300 watts and up. 2 Your choice of 
4,6, or 10 foot dish antennas for your trans./rec 
  station. ( Free Antenna Location Service with purchase! ) 3 Your choice of 
video camera and props. 4 Location of your target reception point and needed 
back-up data. 5. Desire to improve the commerical television viewing 
options! 6. A decent library of programming options and techno-guts!

....Too Bad most television stations have phone line control over their 
 transmitters, and a Line integrity transeiver, or it might even work. 
  (Doubtful, though)

Jam? Maybe, Broadcast over, No. you could to a much more effective job 
of Jamming with a baseball bat to the transmitter. If your Microwave 
overn isn't within full line of sight range, you can forget even trying to get 
the little blip, that It might even cause. (If that) You're forgetting 
people, that a microwave uplink is not very powerful, (usually around 100 
watts) but they have very large antennas, and are usually on top of some 
fairly large hill, or building. Meanwhile, you're using a cooking device, 
with an antenna smaller than most dummy loads, from your own backyard, which 
is probably not too high up in the air. Please people, let's move on to a 
topic that has some truths to it!?

Hardly an inside job.  They just aimed their transmitter at the same 
transponder that WGN uses, and used a higher power.  It diesn't even have to 
be significantly higher.  Just more, and the WGN signal will cancel out.  As I 
said before, it's one of those things that doesn't work out on paper.  But it 
works.  Welcome to Earth--Where everything you know is wrong.
