Recent news:

Employees at the First National Bank of Chicago were caught in an attempt to
steal $70 million through computers and wire transfers. There have been many
articles on this and I could take up about three issues by typing up the six
articles on it that I have found but I would much rather just print a single
article that covers everything and is very short. This article is very short
but explains what happened. It comes from USA TODAY. The date of the article is
May 20, 1988.

TITLE: $70M Bank Scam is Foiled; 7 Charged
FROM: USA TODAY
DATE: May 20, 1988


     Seven men were charged Wednesday in a sophisticated scheme to steal $70
million from First National Bank of Chicao through wire transfers to Vienna,
Austria. Four men were in custody. Two bank employees- Otis Wilson and Gabriel
Taylor- are accused of providing confidential code words needed for money
transfers by computer. The money- from corporate accounts of Merrill Lynch,
United Air Lines and a liquor company -was recovered from the new accounts.
Bank spokesman Tony Zehnder called it one of the biggest-ever "almost-crimes."

TITLE: Long-distance Bill is a Monkey on his Back
FROM: The Chicago Sun-Times
DATE: MAY 20, 1988


     Dear Action Time: Take a gander at my phone bill. It's a nightmare.
     This all began in Febrary, when my long-distance company, MidAmerica in
Omaha, Neb., sent a $540 bill. I tried calling but the firm wouldn't accept my
call. I tried writing but never got an answer. But I did get a March bill for
a whopping $507.50.
     Illinois Bell provided me with a special toll-free number for Mid America.
A clerk took my call, assured me it was a computer error and promised
everything would be OK. Whew! Thank Goodness.
     Unfortunately, my relief was short-lived, because my next bill was for
$2,045.04. Look at all those calls, 33 pages of them. It looks like a
chimpanzee compiled it. The calls cover practically the entire country. I'm 74
years old and on a fixed income. I've got enough sense to realize I couln't
never make that many calls and pay for them. I tried to contact that same
clerk, but she was out to lunch and never returned my call. Am I up a tree?

     Dear Mute: With the chimp? All kidding aside, Janet Moss told us she had
processed two credits to cover the total bill. But for some reason, the
credits were still mirred down in the office machinery. Moss, customer services
manager, assured us they will get through.
     In the meantime, you may still get hit with a few bogus calls on your next
bill. Ignore them, said Moss, who also clarified the error: long-distance
fraud.

NOTA:


And some people still wonder how a code can last for months without someone
noticing.

TITLE: Attack of the Computer Crackers

               The New Wave of Juvenile Techno-Delinquents
___________________________________________________________________________

  And now that high-tech mischeif has moved from the realm of alienated whiz
kids to mainstream teens, a new wave of so-called computer "Crackers" is
taking form--one wider, deeper, and better organized than ever before.
  The Nation had better hang on tight to its data bases.
  An electronic mail system furthers the culture, as members message each
other's computers via the phone lines.  Computer files where any member is
free to deposit a message are called electronic bulletin boards.  There is
really no way to count the number of crackers exchanging tips and techniques
this way--certainly they number in the thousands.  Here is one of the many
Manifesto's:
  "This is our world now ... The world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service that already exists without
paying for what could be dirt cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons,
and you call us criminals.  We explore, and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge, and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias, and you call us criminals.  You
build atomic bombs, wage wars, you murder, you cheat and lie to us and try to
make us believe it is for our own good, yet we're the criminals."
  "Yes!  I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is that of
judging people by what they think and say, not what they look like.  My crime
is that of outsmarting you, something you will never forgive me for.  I am a
hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual, but you can't
stop us all.  After all, we're all alike."
  To make an impact in the phreak/hack world, you have to be busted or do
something major.  This is the code of Cyberpunk, a real-life version of the
high-tech, low-life vision of science-fiction writer William Gibson.
  One underground publication, 'Phrack World News', even prints electronic
profiles of well-known crackers such as Lord Digital.  Copies of 'Phrack' are
electronically passed between underground BBS systems, where they cana user with the special "security clearance."
  Many crackers go by this version of Cyberpunk, "I'm smart but I party.  I'm
reckless, but I'm reponsible.  I'm very childlike at times, and at other times
I can be very serious.  I'm different than everyone else in my high school."

    "a new wave of so-called computer 'Crackers'"


Actually hackers would be a better name since crackers is a word that describes
people who remove the copy-protection from software.

     "Here is one of the many

What was printed is part of a file on hackers and what they stand for. It was
an anonymous file written a few years ago and I have seen it around on several
bulletin boards.

     "To make an impact in the phreak/hack world, you have to be busted or
do something major."


I have heard stories of people who TRY to get busted so that they can get
their name in the paper and be famous. As for doing something "major" there
are many tall tales in the phreak/hack world by pseudo-hackers and some
pseudo-phreaks who are trying to get a name for themselves.

     "One underground publication, 'Phrack World News', even prints electronic
profiles of well-known crackers such as Lord Digital."


Phrack World News (PWN) is a regular feature of Phrack Magazine. It gives
details on the latest happenings and is very similar to TNS. Unfortunately,
Phrack World News has practically died since Knight Lightning has quit
writing it. The profile on Lord Digital is unknown to me, but the profile
wouldn't be a part of PWN.

     "Copies of 'Phrack' are electronically passed between underground
BBS systems, where they can be read by a user with the special 'security clearance.'"


Phrack is availiable to all people and is spread without discrimination. It
is freely distributed and no one needs any security clearance to read it. I
swear to god... this sounds like something that Oryan QUEST wrote.

        TEEN HACKER 'INVADES' NEW SECURE COMPUTER 
  
    PARIS(Reuters)- A 19-year-old West German hacker has succeeded 
    in breaking the world's top-selling computers, 
    Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX system, in what experts say is a 
    new blow to confidence in computer security. 
        Computer specialists broke the news yesterday at a computer 
conference already shocked by the arrest on Sunday of West 
    German hacker Steffen Wernery, 26, as he arrived to take part 
    in a panel debate on system security. 
        Wernery is a member of the Hamburg-based Chaos Computer 
    Club which caused a storm last year when it revealed it had 
    penetrated more than 100 computers around the world, including Enter a
carriage return to see the next page or S to stop...    y NASA. 
        French police announced later that Wernery had been charged 
    with "theft, destruction and damaging computer goods" and had 
    been jailed pending trial. 
        West German journalist and computer expert Hans Gliss, who 
     was also held briefly by French police when he arrived in Paris 
    on Sunday, said the unidentified 19-year-old from Munich had 
    worked out how to enter VAX computers made by Digital. 
        Gliss said the Munich hacker had breached the VAX system by 
    using material openly available from Digital, which is based in 
Maynard, Mass. 
        Digital executives were in a meeting and not available for 
    comment, a spokeswoman said. 
        Rudiger Dierstein, of West Germany's national space foundation 
DFVLR, said the consequences of the Munich hacker's achievement 
    were "terrifying." 
        "This person has given a full description of how to gain access 
    to the system and gain full control. Imagine combining the 
    intelligence of this hacker with a definite criminal intention," 
    he said.
