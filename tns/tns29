All of Tolmes News Service Issue #29 will be filled with various little
things about the modem community... sort of an issue of QuickNotes and
LongNotes.

Bellcore: Back?
---------------

The facts surrounding whether or not Bellcore Systems will return are rather
sketchy at the moment.

All I can say: maybe? maybe not.

Bell South is trying out a new feature called the Intelligent Network which
is able to complete a variety of tasks. More information later.

Nothing has yet become of the "Max Headroom" TV Pirate... so it's likely
that nothing will ever become of it.

Chris Bender has modified some hacker programs for the C-64 to hack against
the false carrier (most recently implemented by Allnet). For those who need
a Commodore hacker program that works against the false carrier, contact him.

The Pawn: Busted?
-----------------

Upon calling his 410 mailbox, The Pawn received the following message. This
is not the exact message but effectively what was stated:


     "Hello... This is the phone company and we're calling about some
conference calls that were set up with the number 1-800-241-xxxx which were
made fraudulently, and we'll contact you about it later."


Once The Pawn heard this he began to panic. He got rid of any bad codes or
bridges and took several other precautions. It most probably that someone
saw it on an Alliance bill and called it up. Anything that happens with this
will be explained in later issues of TNS.

Pirate Communications: Back!
----------------------------

Pirate Communications Systems came back recently after being down for about
4 months or so. It is not the greatest board but you might consider giving it
a call.


              Pirate Communications.... (206) 362-4008


     NOTE: Pirate Communications Systems has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with
the files that I wrote called Pirate Communications Productions. I don't even
call PCS.

For those whoER has returned after being gone for
a long time. I'm sure most people are familiar with SLAVE DRIVER and everything
that he has been involved with.

Return of Atlantis:
-------------------

Atlantis has reportedly returned. This is not certain but here is the report.


                    Atlantis  (804) 355-7327
                    Sysops: Peter Gunn
                            The Lineman
                            Sir William

The OLD Atlantis (215) was taken down by federal authorities when it involved
attempts to card some stuff. Several youths were, supposedly, busted for
carding. When the authorities asked how they learned to card, they said from
files on Atlantis.

TROUBLE:

The Lineman reportedly gave over the entire bbs to federal authorities and
gave authorities the entire userlog with everyone's name and everything.
This makes one wonder what will become of this new board. It is not at the
same number and Peter Gunn is involved.


The following is what was said in Phrack World News about how Atlantis was
taken down:
[All quoted material from PWN-Issue #15]



"One of the offshoots of this investigation is the end of The Lost City
of Atlantis and The Lineman's treason against the community he once helped to
bring about.  In Pennsylvainia, 9 people were busted for credit card fraud.
When asked where they learned how to perform the art in which they had been
caught, they all responded with the reply of text files from The Lost City Of
Atlantis."

"So, the Secret Service decided to give The Lineman a visit.  Lineman, age 16 (a
minor) had no charges against him, but he panicked anyway and turned over the
bulletin board, all g-philes, and the complete userlog to the Secret Service.
This included information from the "Club Board."  The final outcome of this
action is still on its way.  In the meantime, many hackers are preparing for
the worst."



Since it came from PWN, it might not be true. Here are some messages from the
"new" Lost City of Atlantis concerning the new Atlantis and everything else.

The first thing is the newuser message that explains how the Lost City of
Atlantis went down because of "technical difficulties."

><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><


 ATLANTIS IS A PRIVATE SYSTEM.  IT WAS STARTED IN THE FALL OF 1985, RUN BY THE
LINEMAN IN PHILADELPHIA.  SUMMER OF '87, ATLANTIS WENT DOWN, DUE TO TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES, AND UNTIL EARLY FEBRUARY OF '88, THE SYSTEM STAYED DOWN.  NOW,
SHE IS BACK UP UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.

  ATLANTIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEDICATED TO THE DISCUSSION OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION
INVOLVING TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MAIN FRAME SYSTEMS, CHEMISTRY, ETC.  ITS USERS
ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE APPLIED FOR ACCESS, AND RECEIVED ENOUGH VOTES IN
THEIR FAVOR FROM THE HIGH-ACCESS USERS TO BE ALLOWED ON.  YOU WILL BE ASKED TO
ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS IN FEEDBACK AS YOUR APPLICATION FOR VALIDATION, AND ONCE
COMPLETED, IT WILL BE VIEWED BY THE HIGH-ACCESS USERS AND THEY WILL EACH  IF YOU WILL BE ACCEPTED.  IN THE APPLICATION BELOW, IF YOU ARE NOT
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE TYPES OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION MENTIONED ABOVE, PLEASE
LET ME KNOW.

USER FEE:
--------

  LOCAL USERS ARE WELCOME ON ATLANTIS, BUT THERE IS A $5 ANNUAL USER FEE.  THIS
FEE DOES NOT APPLY TO LONG-DISTANCE USERS.

ATLANTIS CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:

* APPLE //E 128K 80 COLUMNS
* 2 APPLE DISK ][ DRIVES
* XEBEC 30 MB HARD DISK
* TIMEMASTER ][ H.O. CLOCK
* US ROBOTICS COURIER 2400E MODEM
  OPERATING AT 300/1200/2400 BPS

  IF YOU ARE LOCAL, LET ME KNOW IN YOUR APPLICATION.  I WILL ALLOW YOU ONE
VALIDATED CALL, IF YOU ARE VOTED ON, TO LOOK AROUND THE SYSTEM AND DECIDE ABOUT
SUBSCRIBING.

  ONE MORE THING: IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU DO NOT USE YOUR REAL NAME ON THIS
SYSTEM.  INSTEAD, YOU SHOULD CHOOSE AN ALIAS TO USE HERE.  USERS CAUGHT USING
MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT ON ATLANTIS WILL NOT BE WARNED.

><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><

The "NEW MANAGEMENT" is Peter Gunn (who seems to be doing an excellent job).
The new users aren't the same as the old users, though I'd expect many of
the users from the "old" Lost City of Atlantis to return now that they know it
is back up.

The user fee is something new, as is the allowance of locals to get on as
long as they pay $5.

Here are just a few messages on the new Atlantis from the first sub-board:

45/71: User fee & other private...
From: PETER GUNN
Date: MON FEB 22  3:22:10 PM

As of now, all newusers who log on will notice that there will be a $5
subscription fee for all newusers who are voted onto the system by the
high-access users.  I hope this doesn't upset anyone, but the $5 is good for
one year, and all users who got passwords before this became effective will
have the rest of the year free.  All newusers who get voted on will have one
call to look around the system, once validated, and then they can leave
(f)eedback to me with their decision.  This will help me pay for the drastic
improvements to Atlantis, or at least buy cigarettes, and it will also help to
keep the user quality up.  I like running Atlantis, but I don't like to have
unproductives on the system, and neither do the productive users.  I'm sure you
inderstand.  Later...

54/71: WARNING!
From: PETER GUNN
Date: WED FEB 24  2:52:43 PM

This is a warning to all... This system is devoted to the discussion of
telecommunications and technical information of all types, but there are places
where things that have nothing to do with telecommunications may be posted. In
other words, everything has its place here, so keep that in mind.  The jist of
this message is that, for example, on the Main Frames conference, you may be as
explicit as you want with your message, but do not under any circumstances post
any illegal access codes there.  Same goes for the Telecom conference.  E-Mail
is private, and so are the Club Board and Upper Class, so you may post anything
you want there. For the super-high acces remember to keep anything
you don't want accessed by just anyone on the private sectors of this system.
This is a rule I must enforce, and I think you all know why.  Thanks...

56/71: CODES
From: PETER GUNN
Date: THU FEB 25  1:36:22 AM

This message is for the information of the long-distance users.  Atlantis
Management will not tolerate the posting of codes, passwords, etc, on this
board.  This is the PUBLIC board!  I just want that to be clear.  In fact, you
should use the telecommunications or main frame boards to even discuss that
stuff.  You may use E-Mail for things like codes and passwords, or the two
PRIVATE conferences on this system, but only there.  Nowhere else on this
system in the subs, or in g-files or articles.  There are other users on this
system, and that's why the private sections of Atlantis are there.  Also, do
not rag on the local users.  They are mostly cool, wit[h very few exceptions, so
unless a user is completely out of line with something, lay off the ragging.  I
will lock out users for abusive behavior.  Thanks.  I know this system will get
whwhere it's going as long as you all can be civilized, and let me get the
system moving along.

Also, I want to let everyone know what the term: Leech means.

A leech is someone who posts just to access the g-files section.  There have
been a few offenders, and they have been warned.  If it happens again, his
account will be deleted indefinitely.  I don't mind if you access the g-files
to your limit, if you are a productive user, but if you post useless, pointless
messages, and then access all the g-files you can get your hands on, I will
know, and so will the other co-sysops.  Hell, you can just read a post and tell
if it was a g-file post!  Also, the user log tells me what everyone does on
here, and when.  Please, if you don't plan to contribute as much as you take
from this board, then don't call.  Most of you are model users, but there are a
select few who are looking out for #1.

Also, the g-files are scheduled for a little updating.  I am working on that
department now, so I will let you know when new files and articles are made
available.

61/71: Re:Re:Does anyone
From: THE LINEMAN

Mormon:


     Must you use incorrect spelling on this system (e.g. "bux", instead of
bucks; "STUPH", instead of stuff) ?

64/71: Wow...
From: THE DISK JOCKEY
Date: SUN FEB 28  1:08:51 AM

really strange to be on it again after all this time, and to see messages from
some of the people that were once so regular of callers...  Hope the system
becomes active again.

Wish the tabs key worked....

Messages from the old Atlantis are still on this board (they haven't been
wiped out even though they are from last summer).

New users are, of course, welcome to call... so please do:
