FROM THE EDITOR:

We still need a lot of material to create the next few issues.  If you have
anything you can contribute please contribute.  Write an article anything.

I was going to publish a list of the best hackers in OZ, but we came to the
conclussion that it wouldn't be a good idea, particularly since so many things
are going on at the moment.  Instead Volume #4 or possibly #5 will have a 
list of the top five loosers of all time.  It should be quite interesting,
and I would like your help with this one, so if you know anyone who qualifies,
please mail me.

I must apologise for the lateness of this edition, but due to circumstances 
which you may know about, it was not possible to finish this file in time.  If
you don't know what has been happening, I guess you should be filled in.
A reasonably large majority of Realm Members got busted.  Seems like someone
gave out a phone number (won't mention names, but it doesn't take much
imagination to figure out who it was).  The number was given out to save ones
ass, which was rather stupid since it revealed possible witnesses agains't that
person.  DO YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEDS??   Or I think you should ask yourself 
DO YOUR FRIENDS KNOW YOU??    If so, It might be a good idea to think about it.

Reason number two...  Rumour has it that telescum have traced a large number
of people and compiled a list of hackers using Viatel or Austpac.  From what
I hear (source reasonably reliable) is that they have been going round talking
to people on that list, trying to obtain info on some of the more notorious
characters.   To add more weight to the rumour, a person close to the telescum
war machine has confirmed the existence of such a list.
Aparently I am at the top of the list, with some of the other more active
people. (If nothing else I guess it's nice to be appreciated.)

With all these things going on, we had to take some security precautions like
encryption of all data, spliting the realm into sections and running each at
a different location etc. This is the major reason for the delay.

I guess if you read volume #4 things will still be going great.  If not, you
can pretty well guess the reason for the compulsory retirement. 
(Hehehe Is that possible??) 

May your lines be untraceable.

OUTDIAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nope, as a matter of policy, no more outdials.   This is the second last Issue,
where you can pick up some outdials,  (not so flash).   They die to quickly
and there are only 2 more international I know off.   I suggest for your
outdial needs, use either Unix, Primes or VAX's with an outdial modem.  There
is a lot of them out there.


3106072912  HOUSTON OUTDIAL
3106007376  HOUSTON OUTDIAL        This one used to be a very good, but due
                                   to obuse once again the old NUA has been
                                   changed.   An additional complication is a
                                   password protection they have added.


3106002046  MITEL/CANATA          This one has been used long time ago, and
                                  like the houston O/D it has password 
                                  protection.   I didn't get this one, and I 
                                  am not sure who did, so I don't know who 
                                  to give credit to. Sorry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNUSUAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You all know the 03106 gateway.  To connect to it,  you just use that NUA.
Here are some more interesting ones you may not have.

03104 - MCII IMPACS
03132 - Compuserve
03113 - RCA-LSDS
03119 - TRT-DATAPAK
03740 - TEXTEL Trinidad
04542 - C & W  INTELPAK  Hong Kong
04877 - ITA UDAS  Taiwan 

I'll have some more for you, possibly next month.   One thing to note, is that
I have connected to these from DATEX-P,  so some may not work from AUSTPAC
or MIDAS.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM PASSWORDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am very sorry about this, but due to my obsession with Primes, you will 
just have to put up with them for a little longer.

31106030002015  Primos 18.2.1  DPC1       This is the DARTMOUTH PRIME I have
                                          Listed previously, but try logging
                                          is as DOS/DOS instead of GAMES/GAMES

26245890090831  Primos 19.3.4-Z GRAF      LOGIN  TEST


26245221040595  Primos 20.2.4v  TWF_K     LOGIN  PRIME/PRIME


This leaves me with 3 more primes to go,  but don't be afraid, in the next 
issue I promis I will have something slightly better, like a VAX or two 
in ISRAEL.

TRIX OF THE TRADE           
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Minerva Now has some very claver ways as far as detecting hackers.  They have
learned that there are certain systems frequently visited by hackers, like
Altos for example.  If you connect to altos directly from minerva, you can
say bye bye to your account.  This has been known for a while, but here 
is a slightly new one.

I have been on altos late one evening, (Going via a PAD in GERMANY), when an
operator breaks in.  We had a short chat, but I failed to get him going in
any sort of a decent conversation.  You can usually pick up some usefull
information.  In a situation like this, there is really no need to hang up
or be paranoid about getting traced, since if they wanted to, they could 
have traced any time. Even if it was their intention to trace you, they would
have done it before revealing themselves to you. 
I managed to capture the last bits of the convo (Remembered to Turn on My
Buffer. A little late, but still)

THE ACTUAL CONVO:   (Operator is in lower case)
...............................................................................

HELLO OPERATOR

* OPERATOR user 10 *
you realise i am going to kill this account
I KNOW, AND I WILL GET A NEW ONE.  WE HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR UHH 3 YEARS NOW OR SO
not when i am finished with you

A WELL, IT'S LIKE A SPORT TO ME.  IT GETS RATHER ADDICTIVE.
HOW LONG WERE YOU AN OPERATOR HERE?

bye bye


Bye at 20:22
HANG ON


***From PRIMOS: Forced off.

CLR PAD 
...............................................................................


This is nothing dramatic, since anyone who ever used minerva for a while 
would have had a simmilar experience.  The account, naturally, died the
minute I was forced off, but surelly the next day,  it was back up working
as usual under the old password??  A hah,  it's enough for anyone to
smell a trap.  This is all leading up to the point I am making and that is,
don't use minerva accounts given to you by other people and don't give out
accounts you use.   I gave the ID do an italian hacker, and he would have 
had no knowldge of this event and anything he would have done on the ID would
have most probably been recorded.  I actually went on the account and changed
the pw myself so he couldn't use it before I had the chance to contact him.
I think the reason OTC does that is to see what addresses are being used, so
that they can more easilly determine a hacker on another ID, just by the 
address used from it.  This is not an isolated incident, because it has 
happened on several occasions in the past.  What I don't understand, is why
they kill the account and then bring it back up?   
Another, even more likelly explanation, is simply the real user finds his
account not working, dials Minerva gets the password changed,  and restores
it to his old one.   In that case, it would mean Minerva is trying to cover
up something shocking.  I would imagine they wipe the bill off,  and don't
tell the user that a hacker has been on the account, but who knows??

This is all bad anough, but minerva actually goes one step further.  There 
are regular hackers of minerva, who have actually been given their own 
ID's to use, which they can check on.   Now, if that isn't low, I don't know
what is.
An interesting solution to the problem would be to mail all the real users 
and tell them the NUA for altos.  If someone does that, they will think twice
before killing off the real users.   (if anyone is game enuff, please check
with the altos sysops first)

BT GOLD
~~~~~~~

I have spent so much time hacking BT GOLD, that it really isn't funny. I didn't
actually spend a lot of time on it, just small bits extended over the past few
years.    Some of you may recal the good ole days when minerva was
actually minerva not keyling (a Dominant system) and Telememo was Telememo not
keylink a (Shitty system).  Keylink is now a shitty system and Telememo has
improved a bit, but on the whole it still sux.   Good after this rambling, 
I refering to late 1984-1985 where there was no such thing as security on
Minerva.  Them were the days where one could spend 24 hrs Sprinting and 
not worry about the account dying.   It was the time where every second 
password was the users first name and everyone had a supply of at least 200+
accounts at the one time.   

Ahh what a flashback.  Would be nice to have a time machine.  Anyway, as you
all know, minerva is only one system, a part of the entire DIALCOM Network.
(Ok, 3 systems if you want to be picky  07,08 and 09).   A lot of countries 
have a dialcom system of their own, and there is no reason why there can't
be one at the stage of minerva 4 years ago.  Somehow I don't see the operators
worried about hackers in countries like Singapore, HONG-KONG etc (The list
goes on and on). I hope you can now appreciate the potential to find a nice
ripe system, ready for the taking.

In order to be usefull, a dialcom must have the NETLINK Facility, and it must
have an ONLINE USERLISTING.  Without a Netlink, you can't use it as a pad,
and you can't use it for sprinting.  Without a User Directory, it is 
very difficult indeed to hack another account once the ones that you have
information on are exhausted.

PRIMECON NETWORK  -  Us Dialcoms systems are useless, since they don't have
                     an online user list.  I have only chacked system 41
                     and systems in the same cluster namelly in the high
                     thirties and fifties.   There could still be hope for
                     SYSTEMS 90-99   including the inhouse dialcom system 98.

BT GOLD           -  A fantastic system.   The user directory is more 
                  -  Comprehensive than that on Minerva.  Only problem is 
                     that there is no NETLINK, which makes it rather useless.
                     There is however a netlink on system 80,  which is used 
                     by BT GOLD Staff.

As you can see, BT GOLD was an incredible waist of time, but because there is
hope of finding an unripe dialcom ready for raping dialcoms are all go.
The BT GOLD account I got, came from an italian hacker and has been passed
around for some time before that.

                   U.S. Canadian traffic is complicated by many  
                   factors.  the most common kind of traffic originates in 
                   Canada from a terminal and terminates on a host in the  
                   U.S.  This is Inbound 3101 Collect and is billed by
                   Tymnet in U.S. dollars.  Whether traffic is 3101 or 3000
                   traffic is determined soley by the nature of the   
                   connection in Canada; 3000 is a host, 3101 is a terminal.   
     
                   A username is not needed to access Tymnet from Canada   


NOTES:     There is a well defined area code for NUA's in a particular area,
           much like TELENET, however the area codes a unique and don't match
           the PTSN area codes.  For reference, look up the datapac outdials
           in Volume #2, which relates their codes to the PTSN ones. There
           are lot more areas then given in the outdial list, but usually there
           is some indication as to where the NUA's are.

 In light of the recent excellent articles emerging from the REALM, I feel a
 contribution on a more specific topic may be needed.
 
 
 After a time the superficial aspects of hacking tend to erode and while the
 important aspects still remain IE.  An  outdial is an outdial, an NUI is an
 NUI etc bits and  pieces  tend  to  be  forgotten  or  not  passed from one
 "generation" of hacker to the next,  or  are  just plain not bothered with.
 If asked what is the difference  between  X.25 and X.29 or Async and Sync I
 assume that a good percentage of hackers would be able to tell me, BUT only
 after looking in something like the  Hackers  Handbook.  Now what I hope to
 do is explain a LOT deeper what  various  terminologies mean, this will not
 of course help people hack but I  think  it  will help people to undeyyrstand
 just what sort of technology  and  complexity  the  equipment that Austpac,
 Midas etc use. 
 
 
     Lets start with the X series  of  protocols.  As  there are approx. 199
 different X categories, and as  only  4  are  really  relevant to us, we'll
 concentrate on the 2 most well known but misunderstood they being of course  
 X.25 & X.28 and 2 others, X.3. and X.29.
    Put  simply  X.25  deals  specifically  with  the  interface  between  a
 Dedicated Terminal and the PAD they may be using, while X.29 deals with the
 transmission of data between two or more  PADS.  Now to connect directly up
 to an X.25 with a  non (Start/Stop terminal, what we all use) would be very
 nice,  but  unfortunately  this   can   not  be  accomplished  without  the
 intervention of the X.3.  As an aid follow the picture
 
                   3 Separate Examples of Communication
 
 [ME X.28]------------------|=PAD==X.29==PAD==|-------------------[YOU X.28]
                            |        |        |
 [DPTE\                     |        |        |                       /DPTE]
 [DPTE+[X.25]---------------|-Packet Network--|-----------------[X.25]+DPTE]
 [DPTE/                     |        |        |                       \DPTE]
                            |        |        |
 [ME X.28]------------------|=PAD==X.29=======|-----------------[X.25]+DPTE]
 
 Confused?? Well let's clarify things  according  to the above diagram.   On
 the top line we see that we  are  assigned  as  needing an X.28 (simply the
 asynch character transmission mode  that  we  mainly use because we have no
 built in packet switching capabilities  IE. we are not connected to an X.25
 DPTE (my own definition of Dedicated  Packet-switching  Terminal  Equipment
 There must be two X.3's (PADS) when  connecting  non DPTE's.  What the X.25
 Protocol really does is allow many  terminals  to  be accessed individually
 from a PAD.   And  what  is  the  PADS'  purpose?  Simply  to  allow  us to
 communicate to X.25 equipment.
 
 On the second  line  we  have  a  DPTE  (X.25  the  physical  link/protocol
 connected straight through without  the  need  for either X.28, X.29 or X.3
 protocols) this is the most  straightforward  connection as both DTE's have
 inbuilt packetising information. 
 
 The third line shows the connection of  a standard terminal through the PAD
 as you can see only one side  needs  packetising  and  protocol  conversion
 straight through. This example is mostly  what we are concerned with for we
 are the X.28 we reach the PAD  (Austpac  for  example) and depending on our
 NUA connect to the X.25 gateway, then the host terminal or destination.  An
 example of this would be the DNIC  3106  this would establish which gateway
 you want to access in this case Tymnet.  The rest of the NUA (actually when
 calling international X.25 another X category  is used X.121 or simply Data
 Network Identification Code) lets  say  NUA  03106+[000636]<-- would select
 which computer on the X.25 gateway you want to connect with. 
 
 At this point you may have  noticed  that  your  whole concept of a PAD has
 changed, a PAD merely Disassembles Data,  shoots it into the Packet Network
 and then Assembles the data back so  that  it  can be received depending on
 what the X.25 has to say. The whole point  of the X.29 is so that two PADS'
 can communicate. X.25 serve  to  generally  control  packet flow as well as
 doing protocol conversions and speed conversions,  allowing you at 300 baud
 to connect to virtually any  system.    Part  of  this packet flow concerns
 where the information is being sent... This introduces the next part
 
                        ESTABLISHING THE CALL
                        ---------------------
 
 There are two ways of establishing  calls  on  a packetised network.  These
 are VC (Virtual Calls) and PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuits).
 
 A VC is the non-physical link  between  the calling Date Terminal Equipment
 (us..DTE) to the called DTE (them..the computer we are calling).  It is the
 exact equivalent to  a  telephone  call  except  that  no  PHYSICAL link is
 established.  Instead a logical channel number (LCN) is set up from then on
 data (packets) are sent to a channel rather  than physically down a wire as
 in the telephone.  Hence  it  is  called  virtual  due  to  it not actually
 existing.
 
 PVC is the same except that  a  permanent  number  is assigned as being the
 logical channel.  This  is  the  equivalent  to  a  direct line but all non
 physical.  The actual "conversation" which takes place when a DTE wishes to 
 call another is explained thus:
 
 
                  DTE to DTE             DCE to DTE 
                  ----------             ----------
                  Call Request --------->Incoming Call
                  Call Accepted<-------- Call Connected
                  Data------------------>Data
                  Data<----------------- Data
                  Clear Request -------->Clear Indication
                  DTE - initiated<------ Network Initiated
                  Clear Confirmation---->Clear Confirmation
 
 What this table represents  is  the  procedures  that  must  occur during a
 connection.  As you can see its all logical with a Calls being requested by 
 us and Calls being notified by them.  This is based on the Telephone system
 whereby we take over in some aspects IE I might say GOODBYE (Clear Request)
 then the person I'm talking to would as well (Clear Indication) and so on.
 
 
 The most up to date explanation to  the  inner  workings of all things X is
 the OSI/RM (Open Systems  Interconnection  Reference  Model).  OSI/RM are a
 collection of different "layers" within  the network which offer developers
 a generalized outline of what a data  network  must  handle.  It is not law
 that people must follow these  procedures  but  it is a concerted effort to
 bring about a standard way to exchange information.  The X.25 system follow
 this architecture very closely and though  OS/RM contains 7 layers and X.25
 contains but three (packet, link and  physical)  the  following explanation
 may serve to explain how a network operates.
 
 
 7. Application Layer Concerns - Am I  talking  to  the right person? Who is
 paying for this call? Is this the best time to talk, or should I call back.
 
 6. Presentation Layer Concerns - Are  we  talking  the same language and/or
 dialect.
 
 5. Session Layer Concerns - Can this  situation  be  handled in one call or
 several?  Will other people need to be  brought in at different times?  Who
 will control the discussion  in  a  multi  party  conversation?   Who  will
 re-establish the call if we are cut off?
 
 4. Transport Layer Concerns - What is the most cost effective way to handle
 this call (or  calls)  consistent  with  priorities?   What  long  distance
 carrier should be used?
 
 3. Network Layer Concerns - Dial the  number  and  listen for call progress
 signals.  Redial if you get a busy signal  or get cut off.  Disconnect when
 the conversation is completed.
 
 2. Link Layer Concerns - Talk when you  are supposed to and listen when you
 are supposed to.   Ask  for  a  repeat  if  there  is  something  you don't
 understand.  Tell the other party to slow down if they are talking to fast.
 
 1. Physical Layer Concerns - These  are  the  actual sounds being made into
 the mouth piece from the receiver.
 
 
 Well that's as far as I'm prepared  to  go  depth wise into packet systems.
 This hasn't even scratched the  surface  of  what's to be known.  If anyone
 would like to know more about a  specific  topic  please E-MAIL me and I'll
 try to help.

 1.   Warning
 
 BETWEEN 8.00 am and 9.00 am every Tuesday, network development  and  service
 work is  carried  out  on  JANET.  This means that if you make a call during
 these hours there is an increased danger of the system going down which  may
 result in loss of data.

 2.   Introduction
 
 The Gateway is a two-way link between the U.K.  Academic Network (JANET) and
 PSS.  At present there are two  Gateways  between  JANET  and  PSS,  one  at
 Rutherford and another at ULCC in London.
 
 The Gateway consists of a computer which holds a communications program  and
 sits between  two  networks  (JANET  and PSS in this case).  This allows the
 user to bridge the gap between the networks and access target  computers  on
 the other  network.   It  is important to realise that there are two ways of
 communicating with the Gateway - you can make calls TO the Gateway  computer
 to access  its limited user facilities or you can make calls THROUGH it to a
 target computer on the other network.
 
 The Gateway operates as a Transport Level Gateway  in  accordance  with  the
 'Yellow Book'  Transport  Service.   However the present implementation does
 not have a full Transport Service and therefore, there are some  limitations
 in the service provided.  For X29 which is incompatible with the Yellow Book
 Transport Service,  special  facilities  are  provided for the input of user
 identification and addresses.
 
 The Gateway is a protocol transparent link.  This  means  that  the  Gateway
 cannot be  used  for  protocol conversion;  to do this a third party machine
 must be used.

 Permission to Use the Gateway
 
 _____________________________________
 4.1  Authentication and Authorisation
 
 No unauthenticated use of the Gateway from JANET is  allowed  regardless  of
 whether charges  are  incurred  at the Gateway or not.  Therefore to use the
 Gateway you have to  obtain  authentication  (a  userid  and  password)  and
 authorisation (a  call  allocation)  from the JANET Network Executive.  This
 consists of:
 
      a. USERID
      b. PASSWORD
      c. USAGE ALLOCATION
 
 Note that the authorisation for PSS and IPSS is managed separately, although
 a single USERID may have authoristation for both.
 
 
 
 ____________________________
 4.2  Charging and Accounting
 
 There are 4 separate charging rates, which are:
 
      PSS full rate:      PSS (FULL)
      PSS discount rate:  PSS (DISC)
      TLXN:               Telex access via Interstream 1.
      IPSS full rate:     IPSS (FULL)
 
 Note that the TELEX access is expensive, as the cost  includes  the  use  of
 PSS, Interstream  1  and  TELEX.   Anyone  who is interested in TELEX access
 should first discuss it with the Network Executive.
 
 To be able to make chargeable calls you must request a  call  allocation  to
 cover   the  charging  rates  you  want  to  use  when  you  ask  for   your
 authentication.  For calls that are free e.g.  calls within JANET or  normal
 charge calls from PSS you do not need an allocation.
 
 The PSS discount rate applies from 1800 to 0800 each night and  all  day  on
 weekends, Christmas  Day  and  New Year's Day.  The PSS full rate applies at
 ALL OTHER times.  The IPSS full rate applies at ALL times for  international
 calls.  For  details of the international rates to various countries consult
 Network User Note 2.
 
 If your allocation runs out during an active call, then that  call  will  be
 cleared and all further calls at that rate will be refused.
 
 ______________________________________________
 5.   How to Make Terminal Calls to the Gateway
 
 It is possible to make calls to the Gateway to access the HELP  and  ACCOUNT
 facilities.
 
 The HELP facility contains the whole of this user guide in its most uptodate
 form.  The facility allows random scans of the  document  and  searches  for
 text within the document.
 
 The Account facility allows the user to inspect the state of his account and
 to change the password for that account.

 6.   How to Make Terminal Calls Through the Gateway
 
 The method used to make a call through the Gateway depends on  the  type  of
 PAD being  used.   If  your PAD supports TS29 the procedure is simplified as
 this protocol allows you to make calls that can cross several  networks  via
 several Gateways.   If  your  PAD  supports  X29  then  if you wish to cross
 several Gateways you normally have to stop at each one before you  can  pass
 through it.  However a special facility is provided using the Call User Data
 Field to allow X29 calls non-stop through the JANET PSS Gateway.
 
 Whichever protocol your PAD supports, you must have some way of generating a
 Transport Service Called Address for onward routing by the Gateway.
 
 _________________________________________
 6.1  The Transport Service Called Address
 
 To make a call  through  the  Gateway  you  have  to  supply  the  following
 information in  the form of a Transport Service Called Address to your local
 PAD.
 
      a. Netname:         the name of the network you are calling.
      b. Authentication:  consisting of Userid and Password in that order.
                          This can be omitted for free calls.
      c. Host address:    the network address of the remote host.
 
 The format of the Transport Service Called Address is as follows:
 
      <Netname>(<Authentication>).<Host Address>
 
 These are explained below.
 
 _______
 Netname
 
 This is one of the following:
 
      JANET to connect to JANET
      PSS   to connect to PSS
      J     an alias for JANET.
 
 
 ______________
 Authentication
 
 This consists of 3 fields which must be entered in the order shown.
 
      a. user id,
      b. password,
      c. A request for the call to be reverse charged.
 
 The last field is optional.
 Note that the whole authentication string must be enclosed  in  parentheses.
 
 _______
 Example
 
      (FRED,XYZ,R)  Requests a reverse charge call
      (FRED,XYZ)    Requests a chargeable call.
 
 ____________
 Host Address
 
 This is the numeric address of the machine being called.   However  to  make
 things easier  the  numeric  address  can  be  replaced with an alphanumeric
 mnemonic if one has been set up on the Gateway.
 
 _______
 Example
 
      use RLGB instead of 000000002105 to call the Rutherford GEC 'B' machine
      use SALF instead of 234261643210 to call Salford on PSS.

 For a list of these mnemonics see JANET User Notes 5 and 6.
 
 Host addresses can be complex and it is possible to specify several Gateways
 that you must pass through to  reach  a  specific  remote  host  and/or  the
 service required.   Note  that  a  point  (.)   must be used to separate the
 numeric addresses or mnemonics from the service names.
 
 _______
 Example
 
      SVPA     - this calls the Sussex SERC Prime on Janet.
      SVPA.FTP - this calls FTP on the Sussex SERC Prime on Janet.
 
 To connect to some machines, an X25 sub-address is required, which  consists
 of a  number  of  extra digits added on to the machine address.  This can be
 easily entered on the Gateway by using the delimiter '-' at the end  of  the
 mnemonic address  and  then  typing  the  sub-address.  When the mnemonic is
 translated the delimiter is ignored and the whole address is converted  into
 a continuous string.

 6.2  Making Calls Using TS29 Protocol
 
 TS29 is the ideal protocol to use through the Gateway, since there should be
 no problem entering the Transport Service Called  Address.   However,  first
 make sure  that  the  machine you are calling will support TS29.  When using
 this protocol for network terminal calls the service name of the TS29 server
 should be entered explicitly.
 
 _____________________
 6.3  The Full Address
 
 Combining all these factors a full address might look like this.
 
      J(FRED,XYZ).RLGB.TS29
 
 ____________________________________
 6.4  Making Calls Using X29 Protocol
 
 X29 is incompatible with the 'Yellow Book' Transport Service and  some  PADS
 are unable to generate the Transport Service Called Address.  When making an
 X29 call,  the  onward Called Address may be entered into the Call User Data
 Field of the Call.  Some PADs, e.g.  the British Telecom PAD are  unable  to
 generate a  Call  User Data Field longer than 12 characters and so there may
 not be enough space to hold all the information required.  In this  case,  a
 Call must  be  established  only  as far as the Gateway, and a dialogue held
 with the Gateway to establish the next part of the connection.
 
 If your PAD can generate a Call User Data Field, then the first character of
 the text is treated as a delimiter, and should be entered as  the  character
 '@' followed by the onward Called address.
 
 _______
 Example
 
 On a CAMTEC PAD one might enter:-
 
      CALL 00004000004096 D=@(FRED,XYZ).SOMEWHERE
 
 to make a call through the London Gateway to SOMEWHERE on PSS.
 
 ________________________________________
 Overcoming Call User Data Field Problems
 
 With X29 PADs the onward Called Address can be supplied interactively at the
 Gateway without having to set up a Call User Data field.   To  do  this  the
 Gateway must  be  called  with  the  correct X25 sub-address.  This involves
 adding an extra 2 digits onto the normal 12 digit address  of  the  Gateway.
 The sub-address  for  JANET  is  69  and  96 for PSS.  The Gateway will then
 prompt for the onward Called Address.
 
 The procedure  is  as  follows:   Call  the  Gateway   using   the   correct
 sub-address:
 
      23422351919169    to call JANET from PSS via the RAL Gateway
      00000000004096    (or the mnemonic RL.PSS) to call PSS from JANET
                        via the RAL Gateway.
 
      23421920014869    to call JANET from PSS via the London Gateway
      00004000004096    (or the mnemonic LON.PSS) to call PSS from
                        JANET via the London Gateway.
 
 
 The response from the Gateway will be the following message:
 
      Please enter your authorisation and address required in form:
      (user,password).address
      >
 
 Reply with the appropriate response.
 
 _______
 Example
 
      (FRED,XYZ).SOMEWHERE
 
 As the X29 protocol is being used there is no need to  include  the  service
 name X29.
 
 Authentication is not required when calls are free, e.g.  for incoming calls
 to JANET.  In this case the string (FRED,XYZ) can be omitted,  note  however
 that the address should still be preceded with a point.
 
 _______
 Example
           .RLGB
 
 There is a timeout of between 3 and 4 minutes for this response after  which
 the call  will  be  cleared,  however  there  is  no  limit to the number of
 attempts which can made within this time limit.   If  the  authorisation  or
 adress entered is invalid the Gateway will request it again.  To abandon the
 attempt clear  the call from the PAD.  For further details of how to do this
 see Network User Note 11.
 
 You will find that on some PADs a 'call connected' message  will  appear  on
 the terminal  as  soon  as the call has been connected to the Gateway.  This
 does not mean that you have made contact  with  your  ultimate  destination.
 When you  have  contacted  the  remote  host  the  Gateway will show a 'Call
 connected to remote address' message.
