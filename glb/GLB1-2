FROM THE EDITOR:

Ok, so here we are again.  Another Edition of GLOBE TROTTER over and done with.
This one took about 100 hours of work to put together and it's not as flash 
as the last one, but I'll make it up to you next time.  I am saving the best
for last.
We have to do something about the hacking situation in this country.
At the moment, it is all rather dismal, and I bet even mr Gill and the HACK
WATCH gang are having nightmares.  So please get into it, and remember if 
there are no hackers Mr GILL's  Multi-million dollar security Company will
go out of business.   Since Bullshiting his clients is what he does best,
how is he going to feed his family if there is no threat from us to combat?
That's about all.  I will see you on the networks and untill next time,
 
Catch Ya Later

OUTDIAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ANF VEN TEL outdial is still going strong, so untill it dies, I will not
release another outdial with international capability.  There are however a
few more outdials I came a cross which you might like to have a look at.

The prompt it gives, is identical to the HOUSTON OUTDIAL PORT (Now Password
Protected), which used to be a first class system, however I have not been able
to get it to dial.  I don't have all that much time to play with them, but
if you can get them to work, please let me know. 

NUA:   03106001892       Clearwater Outdial,  In Florida
NUA:   03106006180       Toronto Outdial

These two operate on identical systems so if you can get one to work, the 
other will follow.  I have more NUA's to similar outdials so it would be
nice to get them going.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNUSUAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I promised you the NUA for ISE BBS, Instrumental Science Engineers Mob I 
think, but the NUA for this board has been going round for quite a while,
and on top of that I can't find it, so look for it yourselves.  It's on 
TELENET somewhere in the 6xx area I THINK.

311061400021   STN International   -   There are 2 good systems on this 
                                       Gateway.
               d  -  Ultrix  Organic Chem BBS    Login: newuser
               g  -  Unix,                       Login: guest
               

That's about all for this issue.  I'll see what I can dig up for the next one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM PASSWORDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have few Primenets, still in the USA and a Rather Nice VAX on PACNET
New Zealand since we feature this rather small network this month.
(Please note that when I say Rather Nice,  I am speaking relativelly to
 The other accounts)

0530173000000   Forest Ministry VAX/VMS V4.6         Login: GUEST
       Notes:   You will have to figure out for yourself how to crash 
                out into DCL hehehe.

031106030002015 PRIMENET 18.2.1   A Dartmouth System    Login: GAMES
       Notes:   The Games Directory seems to be deleted so you may have 
                problems, but the good thing about this prime is that it
                tells you whether an ID is valid or not before you enter
                the password, which makes things rather easy.

0311061700255   PRIMENET 20.2.3vR9.A  PBN43             Login: TEST
       Notes:   This is a tough son of a bitch to hack, but it will get
                you that one step closer.

This is the last primement I have in the USA, which I am going to publish
in these here files so next month few more in Germany and ISRAEL, and then
I'll make an assult on the UNIX, VAX and DG AOS/VS  systems. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TRIX OF THE TRADE           
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

DIALCOM PRIVACY

I am not sure who was the one that first told me about this, but it was most
probabably the late TB1, god rest his soul.  This is just a little bit
different and I will not give you the full story since it would ruin it if
everyone knew about it.
On most systems running Primos, like MINERVA, if you are using an account and
you don't want anyone else logging in at the same time, like the real user
for example and finding what you are doing, simply do this.

>ED
TYPE SYSTEM IS UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME
COMO -N
CHAT <ID>  (or MESSAGE <ID>  which ever works where ID is the ID you are on)
LOG
<CR>
SAVE C_ID
>

ok, just type what is above, ">" not included.  it will create a file which 
will be executed automatically at login.  >ED invokes the text editor,
TYPE .....   will type that message so real user will not get worried.  You
can also say to call back in 5 minutes etc.
COMO -N switches off the terminal, so that the person logging on can't see
what happens from there.
CHAT ID or MESSAGE ID, will send you a message, to inform you that another
user has tried to log on.  You can either not pay any attention if it happens
to be another hacker, but if it's the real user, it's better to delete 
all traces of your presence and leave to call back after he has finished. 
OH YES, important!   Please remember to delete the C_ID file before you
leave or this will happen the next time you try to log on.  if you happen to 
loose your account over this, please look me up, since there are things you
can do I haven't told you about.

SPRINT VS SCAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you ever call a US board and mention to a local PHREAKER or HACKER that you
have some NUA Sprints, he will have nothing but this blank expression on his
face, with the words "HUH?" on his lips. (Stupid Yanks, they were the ones who
invented the term in the first place).  Let me tell you about the history of
SPRINTING.

Once MA BELL was split up into a bunch of smaller phone companies to break
her monopoly on the communications business, it all started.  A company was
formed called sprint.  The US PHREAKS soon caught on to the fact that if they
had a Sprint code,  they could dial anywhere in the world free of charge.  
The sprint code is like a NUI for the DATA NETWORKS.  It's just an account
number to which the call gets billed, so if you happened to have a Sprint code,
you were in business.  To obtain such a code, they systematically scanned
all possible number combinations till they got the right one.  That became
known as Sprinting.   That is, ringing up SPRINT and Trying one combination
after another.   The term sprinting was adopted in Australia to mean 
systematically trying passwords, codes, numbers etc on any system.  The
term 'SPRINTING', has never caught much in the states where they refer to 
SCANNING and thus the confussion. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DNICS
~~~~~
I scoured the various Databases kept by the various networks and compiled the
following list.  Note that not all DNICS can be accessed from all the networks,
especially from Austpac or MIDAS, which don't cary data to a lot of the
networks.   For example: Calls to China can be made only via DATEX-P and some
of the American Networks. (This could have been changed by now).
To find out the individual data carrying contracts between the various 
networks, either check the various Online Dbases, or contact the network 
support.   Contacts are given with each Network Profile. 

I am still amazed why the people can't aggree on simple things such as DNICS 
and NETWORK NAMES especially.  In some cases,  I have found that for the
same data network, each data base I have checked had a different DNIC and 
Network Name.  In that case, I have listed all of the data supplied,  and you
can decide which one you think is correct.

DATAPAC OUTDIALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know you are all sick of DATAPAC OUTDIALS, but they are usefull for dialing
outside systems in Canada.  Every outdial port on DATAPAC (Not Privatelly
owned), services only a particular area, which explains why there are so many
of them. (BUT DOES IT?, And Just how Many Are There?).
The unusual thing you will find, is that outdials in a particular areas, are
all password protected.  Another thing is that from some outdials you can
make calls to america.  They were not designed for this, so I just imagine 
it's some kind of a fault with the outdial itself.

The following is the actual outdial list supplied by DATAPAC, intended for
public use.  It is only a small sample (about 1/20 of the total number)
of what you will find in Volume #3.

Notes:   The above is very useful, because it links DATAPAC NUA's
         with the geographical location.   Datapac has a well defined area
         for all the NUA's, much like TELENET, but the only problem is that 
         The area numbers of the NUA's don't match the PTSN Codes for the same
         area.  If you can't follow that, get out the phone book and have a 
         look at what I mean.   More about that next month. 


PRIME GLORY
~~~~~~~~~~~

I am not ashamed to admit it, but PRIMES of any sorts are my favourite systems.
I am absolutelly in love with the Netlink Gateway most of them have.
It was my intention to publish a complete commands list for various versions
of primos, namelly PRIMENET and DIALCOM, however the files are rather big
and not much use to many hackers so I'll leave them out.   Anyone who needs
such a command list,  just search the directories of the prime you are using,
since there is a good chance the file is there.  Some PRIMENETS have the
file displayed when you  type HELP.  If you can't find it, then just refer to
the FORCE FILES,  where you will find a DIALCOM and PRIMENET (some dicky
version) Command lists. 
Oh, you don't know what a FORCE FILE is?
Well, I'll be refering to them quite a bit for additional information.  In any 
case this is the story:  
Aproximatelly half a year ago, I got really pissed off with hacking, the 
atitude of people and things in general.  A sort of a depp reaction triggered
by a particular person. Basically I decided to give up hacking all together.
Last thing I did was write the FORCE FILES which contained a lot of the
info I accumulated over the last few years.  The files are nothing briliant,
but I will be refering to them quite a bit for additional information from 
time to time which I don't want to repeat in GLOBE TROTTER.  One other 
thing to note, is that the NUA lists in the FORCE FILES were more edited and
rather outdated by now.
Now you know about force files,  oh yes the reason I got back into hacking
few weeks later is rather obvious to anyone who has been addicted to anything.

Now Back to primes.  Primenets in particular are not the easiest to hack, but
like most systems they have their faults.  Old versions, particularly the
ones using Primos revision 17.something and 18. something  actually tell you
whether a USERNAME is valid before you are asked for a password.  This
simplifies things a lot, but it's not so easy with the later versions.
Oh yes, the only place you are going to find versions 17.4 and lower are
countries like BRAZIL etc, which thanx to THE WIZARD you will see in a few 
months time.  On these primitive versions,  one could often type a username,
and when asked for a password press CTRL-C and be dumped passed login into
primos.  Nifty No?
The current versions are little bit harder to hack and the only way I think 
is with inside information or if the defaults are intact.  Primes like VAX's
come with a number of standard Usernames, which the sys opers are known to
leave as is.  some of the common defaults you can try are:

DEMO/DEMO,  SYSTEM/SYSTEM,  PRIME/PRIME,  GAMES/GAMES,  DOS/DOS,  TEST/TEST
TEST/PRIME, BATCH/BATCH,    NETMAN  etc.

I was actually going to publish a listing of all the primenets I have in all my
sprints, but then I realised the horror of going through all the 100+ files
and picking out the primes.   I think it will be better just to give you all
the Sprints and you can pick out the primes for yourselves.   If you are
looking for a place to find a lot of primes,  I can recomend BRAZIL, and
JAPAN, where the percentage of primes vs other systems is rather high.

As far as Sprinting goes, all of the sprints were done using the NETLINK
gateway.  It's the only way of doing it.  Well, Scanning from a VAX has
it's advantages in that you can more easilly set it up as a batch job
and have it running while you're not online.  This is also possible with
Primes, if you have phantom privs, but I haven't found a way to disconnect 
from a NUA other than timeout if it connects.  It is still great for 
exploring new networks, where all you need is but one NUA to guess the
NUA structure.  Another possibility would be a scanner written in CPL,
but that is beyond me at the moment, and the only one I have seen didn't
work all that well. 
You will find a copy of the Primos Sprinter in the Force Files, but the
new version of the program I will not be releacing.  With the New version,
you can hook up two primes in parallel, and if both have a reasonably large
number of outgoing ports,  you can achieve very fast scanning speeds.  The
fastest I have managed so far is something like 500 NUA's a second. The only
problem is that you need very fast host responces to do it.  It works lets say
from MIDAS scanning MIDAS NUA's or PACNET NUA's, but it is impossible to
achieve this efficincy scanning TELENET from MIDAS for example. I assume
there is a dedicated line between MIDAS and PACNET which gives you the
instant responce since no other switching is involved. 

The last thing I want to talk about is DIALCOM sytems.  They also run Primos
and are quite fun as long as they have NETLINK.  I will explain them in more
detail in a couple of months time.

Notes:  At first I thought The NUA structure was that of TELENET ie the
        first one listed and as such, the entire sprint has been done to that
        format.  However, because of the small number of systems that have been
        found and only in some cities, I now believe that the local phone
        exchange is also used in the NUA.   As such it makes it uneconomical
        to Sprint therefore you will have to live with the following list.

So here we are, the end of another file.   There was nothing here as far as
NUA's go,  but I have been working flat out on DATAPAC which has got massive
ammounts of NUA's so I'll try to get that completed.  The first part of
DATAPAC will be in GLOBE TROTTER Volume #3.   From there on, the ammount of
information will decrease due to the lack of NUI'S and other PRIME accounts.

A passionate plea:    If anyone has NUI'S  AUSTPAC ones in particular and 
                      any primes with Netlink, please let me know, perhaps
                      we can make an exchange for info you are not likelly to
                      see here.   

Lastly,  if anyone has any articles or information they would like to
contribute,  please contact me.  We will all appreciate it, especially me, 
since it's a nighmare to come up with all this stuff every month. 



          IN  THE  NEXT  ISSUE  OF  GLOBE  TROTTER,  Volume #3
===============================================================================

 - Featuring: CANADIAN Data network DATAPAC with a first part of a
   complete scan.

  - BT GOLD,  The greates failure and a years work down the drain.

 - I have a month to come up with something, so who knows what will happen,
   but if it does, you are going to hear about it.
