                                "Gravity Bong"


Ok guyz, herez how you can make your very own gravity bong to blow your
  head off wit... Ok, first, get a bucket.  Not a huge bucket, but one
  that you can set a three-liter bottle in, and the top of the bottle still
  sticks out above the rim of the bucket.  Cut about the bottom two inches
  off of the three liter bottle, so you have the one end with the cap, and
  the other end is a big hole.  Take the cap to the three liter bottle, and
  using a pair of scissors or something, carve out a whole big enough to 
  screw a bowl from a (marijuana) pipe into.  Screw the bowl into the cap.

  NOTE: You may need to put like one of those rubber bands that you put in
       your hair (the little bity ones), around the threads to make them 
       air tight!

  Now, fill the bucket up with water and ice cubes.  Load your bowl full of
  your best bud.  Hold a light approx. 1/2 inch from the bowl-o-buds, and
  slowly pull the 3-liter upwards.  This will cause a vacuum, and will fill
  up the 3-liter with some of the most thick yellow smoke you have ever seen!
  Stop pulling up on the 3-liter when you have only about an inch before
  the thing pops outta the water and wastes a huge hit!  Now, carefully
  unskrew the cap (bowl and all) and hold your mouth about 3/4 inch away from
  the top of the 3-liter.  Let out all of the air in your lungs, and when
  you are ready, let go of the 3-liter.  It will fall to the bottom of the
  bucket, and the water will force all of the smoke to come out in one
  steady and condensed stream, and will totally fuck your world.  I can
  gaurentee that after doing three of these by yourself, you won't even want
  to smoke anymore!  Depending on your lung capacity, and how much you smoke,
  you may need to make your 3-liter a little smaller.  I prefer hits that
  make you sit there and cough and gag for 30 minutes.
