BAD SECTOR successful.

     BAD SECTOR has been out for two months now and the success of
the mag is more than this author expected. Despite the two week delay
in the first issue for no apparent reason everything is going well.
This writer had to write or find all the articles because no one has
submitted anything.

A person known as Don Karnage (02/94; McDonald) submitted a story.
Don is also serving twelve years for flogging his parents to death
with two sticks of Beef jerky. This author had to write the other
articles with pseudonyms as to make it appear that all kinds of
authors and writers are submitting.

The first issue was slightly humorous.  Having vowed to make each issue
funnier and funnier, this historian feels the second issue is quite
humorous.

The one problem that may face this magazine is possible copyright
infringement.  Once and awhile a text file will come across my computer
that must be shown to the world.  Having no legal knowledge or expertise
this writer feels that it's OK. If anyone read the second issue, one
will see a scoring article about the FBI and computer crime. There was
no copyright notice on the news article and believe that since the
numbers were so far off from reality that it may be considered fantasy
or fiction (see 03/94) or possibly written on another planet in a
                                galaxy
                            far, far away.

     This Male Lesbian is going to make some changes around here. A
new reader format for instance and all sorts of little neatism's. A
flesch-reading ease score for every article and a Gunnings Fog index.
The grade level of each article will be displayed after each article
in the bottom left-foot corner.

    A friend of this astronomer will be posting this magazine on
internet. Having no experience with internet or care this journalist
hopes that it increases the popualrity of the magazine.
This mag is a big hit in Belgium and a small villiage in Hungry. They
even translate it and put it in the paper. Two days later, however,
the villiage was hit by a freak typhoon. The people in belgium finally
figured out it was in english.

Note: The repeated references by this writer to himself as a third
person is to eliminate using "I" and because this researcher is insane.

Summary of scores.

0:  The minimum score is 0. If you don't have any then your exempt.

1-30:     You are slightly disturbed. There may be hope yet. Delete them

          all and go confess. You're not a pervert but a lonely person that
          needs to get out more often. You have your Dads playboys under
          your mattress.

31-50:    You may be a pervert. There may be a history of GIF's in your

          family. You have special times when you view them and even
                                            have
          a secret drive for them. You also have adult access on the
          local Bible board.

51-115:   You are beyond help. Keep on D/l'ing. Nothing can stop you.
          You probably have a CD-ROM and sit real close to the monitor
          and pretend your in there. Your Idea of a good time is a night

          with the New "Big Booties" CD-rom.

If Your BBS wants to be a distribution Site (I don't know why?) then
Email me on these fine BBS's above or try to hunt down my Phone #.
If you can get it I'll listen to ya. I only allow two BBS's in one area.
I may allow one more Dayton BBS but only if they give me Leech status on
their BBS. This magazine may be going onto the Internet. I not sure yet.
Also I may have a couple of Groupies in Penn. and Belgium. I really don't
expect this Mag to go this far. I have heard rumors that Aliens abducted
someone while reading this Mag and they have decided to invade. I contacted
Zeta Reticuli II and they told me that it was a hoax and relations with
the Democratic party are still intact.
