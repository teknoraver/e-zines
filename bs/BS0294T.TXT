    Why.
    By Vince Lortho

    Why? That's a good question. Why would someone like myself who could
    be having a good life and job and family want to produce this complete
    waste of time. This magazine will cause no changes in your life.
    It will only waste time. You read through some of it and read more and
    more then when you're done you'll have wasted fifteen minutes that could
    have been spent with your children or girlfriend or boyfriend or parole
    officer. But if you're like most people who BBS and travel around the
    nets daily then fifteen minutes is nothing. You probably don't have a
    girl/boy friend anyway. If your like me you just read the easy 179k
    docs for a file that you don't need.

    Most of it is just legal doctrines and disclaimers. I found a copy of
    the Magna Carta in the docs for PKZIP 3.0 plus I found a nice little
    trojan. How many people have heard this:

      "Honey, You spend more time with that...COMPUTER than you do with me!"

      "What did you say dear?"

    Well this magazine is for you. This is the first issue so it's going
    to suck big time but then at the end I'll put a statement that says
    the next issues will be ten times better and I need authors to submit
    humor. I hope no one is offended with anything in this magazine. You
    can sue me but I doubt you'll get anything other than a computer and
    a wall of Mt. Dew cans. OK. Enough of this, you probably stopped reading
    already so who cares. Blah, blah, blah, blah....Number Nine..Number nine.

New software developments.

Beyond 2000: new Software developments.
By Mitch Tegram

BBS Programs

BORGE BBS

Datamaster Inc.
1 Analretentive ave.
Kwigillingak, AK 99210
(800)-EXP-ENSV

BORGE BBS is a brand new software that is rumored to be 100%
hacker proof and has state-of-the-art security features.
System requirements:
Dos 6.20 or higher. 32 megs of Ram and at least a 1 megabyte disk cache.
Pentium p100 processor minimum. Requires 20 nodes for installation.
2.88 meg floppy. 1.4 Terabytes storage (just for BBS) May need additional
space for files. 1280x1024 SVGA graphics. 65000 ISDN Blaster Modem.
1 case Exlax and approximately 8 days for ASSIMILATION.

Features:

Installation:
(Assimilation)
Comes with automatic Floppy changer for easier installation.
Installation features PKWare's new Compression algorithm that packs 1024
bytes into 1 byte using vertical compression and virtual reality data.
Software has 245 Floppies and Is now available in a convenient CD-ROM
format (requires 4 CD-ROM drives for minimum Operation).

Configuration:

BORGE features new DATALOC software ID recognition and locates all
Programs on HD <If theres any space left>. It then verifies if they are
registered and deletes all pirate software. Then New Assimilation(c)
technology deletes all dos files and Installs New BORGE operating system.
(Note: Configuration may require sysop to Major in Computer Software
engineering for 4 years and a expertise in C++ Programming)

Files:

When files are U/l'd. to the BBS the user is required to wait while the new
X-AMIN (c) Technology software system disassembles the file into code and
analyzes the Hueristics of the program. Then the program is reassembled
using new PKZips Bit smasher optimization algorithm.
Reduces file size by 70%.

Any user U/L'ing a dangerous file such as a Virus will receive a 70000 watt
charge through the Phone line thus melting System into plastic door-stop.
(Not responsible for damage to Phone Lines or international switching
satellites or Users that are not grounded)

In new version 1.01 the BBS determines if User needs a specific file
and allows transmission of file if it is deemed necessary to user based
on Logon questionnaires. This saves vital time online for People d/l
Useless files.

Security:

Users, If they pass initial phase of Logon will be asked a series of
1031 questions including SSN, Drivers License, Nationality status,
household info, Car registration, Eating habits, height, and weight.
It also requires the user to give other accounts and PW to other BBS's.
The BBS will use new users Passwords and BBS numbers and call other
BBS automatically and assess what type of board it is and examine
users mail for possible intelligence assessment.

Next phase will require one week waiting period where the computer
access's FBI mainframe and preforms Full Background examination as
well as Credit reports and Job performance. Upon verification of all
Information the user is advanced to level 2 of authorization.
the system transmits a laser optical recognition system to the users
monitor (VGA required). It scans the users retina pattern and stores it.
(Not responsible for Retina damage or Random Monitor explosions)
Once Recognition is complete the user is required to place Hand on
monitor using New Fingersoft technology and the fingerprints are stored.

Additional Features are described in:
"Cliff Notes for BORGE BBS Manuals"


Word Processors:

Geordi Laforge supplement
for WordPerfect 6.0, Word 3.0
and Ami-pro 3.01

Paramount Entertainment Corp.
1 paramount st.
Paramount City, Ca
90210-0213
Price:($450-$700)
1-800-ALL-CASH

Overview:

The Geordi Laforge supplement will help any user spice up ones reports.
It is designed to manipulate text to make the average user feel more
intelligent. It utilizes a new method called BS-THESAURUS (c) and replaces
ordinary words with more complicated words. See below.

"The electric passes through the circuit card and then it sends a signal to
the electrode that causes the light to glow when the user turns on the
computer."

Now activate the Laforge Utility and heres the result:

"Once the impulse from the user is sensed by the tripolymer coated switching
system in the imbedded sensor matrix it activates the isolinear optic
system that results in an internal tachyon discharge to the onboard nano-
processing chip which emits EM radiation to the Electo-transthermal
inducer that cause the gaseous core to ignite and radiate."

As one can easily see that the second paragraph is of a higher technical
level and will result in people taking you seriously.

(Note: Not to be used when Reality or when facts are concerned.)

If you have a new product you want to advertise or you made up
something completely ludicrous and stupid then contact me on the
the boards located at the end of the file.

New unusual virii discovered this year so far.

By Tom Leats

Virus Name:     Farside
Alias:          Sunday Paper virus
V Status:       Rare
Discovery:      January 1994
Symptoms:       System files missing, Dos is sometimes missing and
                reappears computer hangs and strange insects found
                dead inside computer.
Origin:         Outerspace
Eff. Length:     1 - 10,038,323 bytes
Detection method:   Like you couldn't tell.
Removal Instruction:    Just throw computer away or send $100 to John Mcafee

General Comments:
    The Farside Virus activates on every Sunday morning at about 8:30 a.m. and
    Images of fat children with glasses appear on monitor. System files are
    sometimes deleted and replaced with MacIntosh Files. Computer will slow
    down comparable to Tandy Color Computer with Tape Drive. Computer also
    becomes infested with talking cock-roaches and Snakes.

Variations:

    Garfield Virus
Same as above except that stripes are seen on monitor during Dinner hours.


FIDO VIRUS
By: Vince Lortho

Virus Name:     FIDO
Alias:          woof,woof; Redrover; Cajo
V status:       Research
Discovery:      Today 12:34 p.m.
Symptoms:       Computer fetches files that are deleted and displays them.
                Other symptoms see below.
Origin:         Fido_net conferences
Eff Length:     100 - 101 bytes.
Detection Method:   Unknown.
Removal Instructions:   Shoot infected files.

General Comments:
    The Fido Virus is extremely interesting. The virus doesn't do any actual
    Damage to the Computer except that It is impossible to delete files.
    The interesting aspect of this virus is that sends a high pitch Sound
    through the PC speaker or Sound device and causes users animals to go
    Crazy. A case in Cleveland had a Pit Bull that attacked and killed 17
    Users of an Infected BBS. Only disinfection known is to kill animals or
    tear out PC speaker and buy a bigger HD for all the files you can't
    delete.

Variations:
    Batcall virus.

This virus was isolated in Transilvania and causes bats to attack users
When computer is turned on. Research is Continuing.

THE MCDONALD STORY
By Don Karnage.


 I went into a McDonald the other day, peckishly famished. At the register
 stood a bored looking young man. "Give me one of those." I said, pointing at a
 colorful picture on the menu board that showed a burger of some sort.

 "Sir, I'm afraid you're going to have to leave your dog outside." he said,
 eyeing King, my beautiful German Shepard/Rottweiler.

 "Nonsense." I said. "I'll do no such thing. He's a loyal friend and besides,
 he is hungry as well." The kid eyed King again, looked back up at me, and
 went to get his manager. "Ahhh!" I thought. Good idea. Surely the manager
 would know what to do.

 To my horror, the manager kindly (but rather sternly) informed me that dogs,
 (unless they were seeing eye dogs) were not allowed in the restaurant. I
 told him, that, as a visitor to this country and a gentleman, I understood
 his delemmia, but asked if he could look the other way just this once.

 My British charm had no power here. He repeated that I was to leave the dog
 outside. "The only dog I see." I countered, "Is you, and that damned boy you
 call an employee!", and, leaping over the counter, I grabbed the man by his
 tie and told him about manners and the treatment of guests in this country.
 I received my food about half an hour later.

 I had just about finished half of my sandwich before the police arrived.
 "Damnation!" I cried, "Police that carry guns! Cowards!" I called to King
 to attack one of them, whereupon one of the policeman pulled a gun and shot
 King dead. I was escorted directly to jail, released after 2 days on a
 thousand dollar bond, and was fined five thousand dollars.

 Now I ask: Is this the kind of thing we well groomed Brits can expect from
 you colonist savages?
