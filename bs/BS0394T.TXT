BAD SECTOR POLITICAL STATEMENT
(actually I found this somewhere on Fido)

Bill Clinton is my shepard, whom I do not want.
He maketh many lies about green pastures;
He leadeth me beside still factories.
He restoreth my doubt about the demoncratic party.
He leadeth me in the paths of socialism for his manesake.
Yea, I will walk through the valley of the shadow of debt;
And I will fear much evil for he is with me.
His wife and her staff may insure me.
He prepaest a tax hike for me.
That he might giveth presents to mine enemies.
He anointest my wages with inflation.
My expenses runneth over.
Surely poverty and hard times shall follow me
All the days of his administration,
And I will dwell in a rented HUD house forever.

The first issue is over. It was two weeks late for most people and had
numerous spelling errors. Re-releasing it after running the spell checker
didn't do much better. If this issue makes it on time it will be a miracle of
galcian proportions. I will have this issue ready by the end of the first week
of March and hopefully be on time by April. Enough of these rantings.


I found this document on a local BBS. It was called FBI magazine or
something like that. It had various articles by various FBI officials and law
enforcement personell. I found some interesting statistics. I will comment
with {Little French Brackets} when appropriate.

                        THE COMPUTER
                HIGH-TECH INSTRUMENT OF CRIME
                             By
                     Michael G. Noblett
                            Chief
        Document Analysis, Research, and Training Unit
                       FBI Laboratory
                       Washington, DC

     The use of computers as criminal instruments or as devices
to collect information associated with criminal enterprises
increases yearly.  Criminals use computers to store data
relating to drug deals, money laundering, embezzlement, mail
fraud, extortion, and a myriad of other crimes.  In addition to
the simple storage of records, criminals also manipulate data,
infiltrate computers of financial institutions, and illegally
use telephone lines of unsuspecting businesses.

     Statistics suggest that the law enforcement community must
act quickly and decisively to meet the challenge presented by
the criminal use of computers.  For example:

     .  Over 4.7 million personal computers were sold in the
        United States in 1988, as compared with 386,500 in 1980

                   {4.7 million computers at let's
                    say 2500$ a computer= 11,750,000,000$ OK.}

     .  An estimated 60 percent of personal computers are now
        networked

     .  $500 million is lost annually through illegal use of
        telephone access codes
                    {Ok, I'll believe that}

     .  $1 trillion is moved electronically each week, and
          ^^^^^^^^is this a typo?


                    {1,000,000,000,000 a week
                    52 weeks a year.
                    52,000,000,000,000 a year

                    the federal deficit is about
                    4.5 trillion now.

                    If the FBI could catch 8% of this
                    1 Trillion a week crime and put it
                    towards the deficit then the deficit
                    would be eliminated in one year.

                    1 trillion is a lot of cash.
                    it could buy
                    400,000,000  computers 2,500$ each
                    <population of US about 275 million>

                    40,000,000  25,000$ cars.
                    4,000,000  250,000$ homes

                    remember that these hackers usually like
                    electronics and things they can sell.

                    4,000,000,000  250$ stereos

                    This is just for one week!

                    Yearly:
                    2,080,000,000  cars at 25000$ each.

                    If these computer hackers would buy American
                    cars instead of electronics we would destroy
                    Japanese auto market in a week.

                    OR

                    This figure is completely bogus and marked up
                    so this guys budget will pass and he won't be
                    out of a job. I just wanted to post this to show
                    how the government figures numbers. No wonder the
                    deficit is 4.? trillion dollars.


                    Joke: What is a gougleplex?

                    Punch: the goal of the deficit.}


     .  Only 11 percent of computer crime is reported.

     While the law enforcement community, in general, often
thinks of computer crime as high-tech crime, a growing segment
of the population looks at computers and the data they store as
nothing more than electronic paper.  They feel very comfortable
keeping their records, whether legal or illegal, in this format.

     In order to address the legitimate need for access to
computers and the information they contain, law enforcement must
develop a structured approach to examine computer evidence.
^^^^^^^^{More money!!!!}
The examination of this evidence can provide investigative and
intelligence information, and at the same time, preserve the
information for subsequent admission in court.

Thought your exams were tough!
Read on.


                          Final Examination


INSTRUCTIONS:  Read each question carefully.  Answer all questions.
               Time limit is four hours.  Begin immediately.


HISTORY:  Describe the history of the papacy from its origins to the
          present day, concentrating especially but not exclusively,
          on its social, political, economic, religious, and
          philosophical impact on Europe, Asia, America, and Africa.
          Be brief, concise, and specific.

MEDICINE:  You have been provided with a razor blade, a piece of
           gauze, and a bottle of Scotch.  Remove your appendix.  Do
           not suture until your work has been inspected.  You have
           15 minutes.

PUBLIC SPEAKING:  2,500 riot crazed aborigines are storming the
                  classroom.  Calm them.  You may use any ancient
                  language except Latin or Greek.

BIOLOGY:  Create life.  Estimate the differences in subsequent human
          development if this form of life had developed 500 million
          years earlier, with special attention to its probable
          effects on the English Parliamentary system.  Prove your
          thesis.

MUSIC:  Write a piano concerto.  Perform it with flute and drum.  You
        will find a piano under your seat.

PSYCHOLOGY:  Based on your knowledge of their works, evaluate the

             Aphrodisias, Ramses II, Gregory of Nicea, Hammuraby.
             Support your evaluations with quotations from each man's
             work, making appropriate references.  It is not
             necessary to translate.

            the end of the world.  Construct an experiment to test
            your theory.

MANAGEMENT SCIENCE:  Define management.  Define science.  How do they
                     relate?  Why?  Create a generalized algorithm to
                     optimize all management decisions.  Assuming an
                     1130 CPU supporting 50 terminals, each terminal
                     to activate your algorithm independently, design
                     the communications interface and all necessary
                     control programs.

ENGINEERING:  The disassembled parts of a high powered rifle have
              been placed in a box on your desk.  You will also find
              an instruction manual, printed in Swahili.  In ten
              minutes a hungry Bengal tiger will be admitted to the
              room.  Take whatever action you feel is appropriate and
              be prepared to justify your decision.


ECONOMICS:  Develop a realistic plan for refinancing the national
            debt.  Trace the possible effects of your plan in the
            following areas; Cubism, the Donationist Controversy, and
            the Wave Theory of Light.  Outline a method for
            preventing those effects, criticize this method from all
            points of view, and point out the deficiencies of your
            point of view, as demonstrated in your answer to the last
            question.
