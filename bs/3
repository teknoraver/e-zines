Summary of scores. 

0:  The minimum score is 0. If you don't have any then your exempt.

1-30:     You are slightly disturbed. There may be hope yet. Delete them                                                
          all and go confess. You're not a pervert but a lonely person that
          needs to get out more often. You have your Dads playboys under
          your mattress.

31-50:    You may be a pervert. There may be a history of GIF's in your                                                           
          family. You have special times when you view them and even                                                         have
          a secret drive for them. You also have adult access on the
          local Bible board. 

51-115:   You are beyond help. Keep on D/l'ing. Nothing can stop you.
          You probably have a CD-ROM and sit real close to the monitor
          and pretend your in there. Your Idea of a good time is a night                                                          
          with the New "Big Booties" CD-rom.
