SCAM! MAGAZINE Distribution Site Particulars for Sysops


      Some sysops loyally carrying SCAM! MAGAZINE have asked me to clarify some
definitions, so please permit me:

      1.  Authorized SCAM! HQ.  Your board is an "Authorized SCAM! HQ" if and
only if the publisher has specifically worked out the necessary arrangements
with you.  There shall be no more than one HQ per State or Province.  All HQ
boards must, without exception, be authorized.  There is no SCAM! WHQ.

      2.  Authorized SCAM! Distribution Site.  Your board is an "Authorized
SCAM! Distribution Site" if and only if the publisher uploads issues to your
board himself *OR* all of the following conditions apply: (a) you are a SCAM!
Distribution Site (see "3." below); (b) you have sent private mail to SCAM! HQ
stating who you are, the name of your board and its number; (c) you grant the
publisher access to your board; and (d) you promise to make your best effort to
notify SCAM! HQ of any suspected alterations in the contents of this magazine.

      3.  SCAM! Distribution Site.  Your board is a "SCAM! Distribution Site"
if you receive copies of SCAM! uploaded on a regular basis by someone who is
not affiliated with this magazine and you verily believe this person will
continue uploading new issues regularly, as they arrive.

      Please note you do NOT need to notify SCAM! or go through any other
bullshit red tape to become a distribution site, as we wholeheartedly welcome
all boards who wish to carry this magazine.  Since my phone bill will not
permit me to call 2,000 boards to check up on how this magazine is doing,
obviously the vast majority of boards carrying SCAM! will fall into the third
category, therefore the courtesy and kindness of the sysops behind the masks
are relied on and appreciated.  Feedback is always encouraged.  This magazine
is designed to be enjoyable and informative to all readers and I want to know
what yours think, so please tell me.

      If you are the sysop of a SCAM! distribution site and would like to
obtain a copy of the SCAM! Distribution Site ANSI for your board, please leave
me private mail at any SCAM! HQ or call The Rune Stone, SCAM! Connecticut HQ at
(203) 832-8441 and download SCAMDIST.ZIP from the SCAM! MAGAZINE File Area.
